when former colleagues at the bbc asked me to give written evidence to the digital culture media and sport committee ahead of todays questioning of the director general tony hall over the corporations failure to ensure equal pay i didnt expect to be the only woman willing to be named finding myself at a storys centre rather than reporting on it has been strange i put my name forward because i thought people should be able to make up their own minds viewers and listeners in scotland would have heard me on air regularly and will have seen my performance in comparison with my male counterparts unlike other jobs you dont have to rely on the testimony of managers or peers you saw it all for yourself the successes and the bloopers my managers seemed to think i was doing a good job i had consistently good appraisals i broke exclusives and won awards but whenever i asked for a pay rise it was never the right time or the right forum my male colleagues were extremely supportive and many shared their pay details with me it was only when i asked for an equal pay review that i was given an immediate pay rise which brought me up to the average salary for a bbc scotland correspondent there were still male colleagues around me though doing exactly the same job and getting paid more then there was another round of redundancies and nearly all the senior female editors in the newsroom were made redundant there werent many of them to begin with as part of a group of female journalists i took our concerns about gender imbalance to the top of bbc scotland we were listened to but nothing much happened i was asked to sit on bbc scotlands diversity group which had no budget and zero appetite for root and branch reform i suggested that bbc scotland provide better information for female staff who were about to go on maternity leave for instance it should explain that they have the right to be kept informed about secondments and jobs they might like to apply for while on leave nothing happened i asked for an email to be sent to all female staff explaining their right to an equal pay review if they had concerns i was told it would lead to a deluge of requests and hr wouldnt be able to cope they did however provide refreshments for a womens group i set up with a colleague and helped me to find new recruits via the hr database that sums up the situation i found myself in it was an attitude of friendly stonewalling nothing was allowed that would have an impact on the business it may seem bizarre to say that i had sympathy for my managers but i did the bbc i saw was not the one depicted in wa our news department was continually being asked to do more with less and often relied upon the goodwill of staff it was also under attack from all quarters particularly during the scottish referendum there was too much to do too little time and even less money however the fact remained that i was in a position that was unfair i was working just as hard as others who were earning thousands of pounds more several female colleagues told me of situations that were even more unfair but it was not only the women who faced discrimination a male colleague told me how in his female dominated department the women would go out socially and make business decisions which excluded him i still have sympathy for the bbc it has been forced to tackle the issue of unconscious bias which pervades every level of society numerous academic studies have demonstrated that women as well as men favour male candidates life is even tougher if you are from an ethnic minority or have a disability no doubt many other organisations are dreading the day when the gender profile of their salaries is published hall was hauled over the coals by the select committee today but the fact remains as former bbc china editor carrie gracie who resigned in january in protest at gender pay discrimination told the committee ahead of his appearance the corporation was supposed to be an example it pains and hurts me that the corporate machine has not lived up to bbc values she said our business is truth if were the bbc not prepared to look at ourselves honestly how can we be trusted i believe the bbc needs to start by admitting it has a problem over equal pay and then to invest in really good training about unconscious bias the current online course for staff isnt challenging it also needs to be fairer in the way opportunities are awarded currently interviews dont have to be held for secondments under three months while this allows the bbc to move staff around quickly the best assignments are often handed to men which leaves them with a more impressive cv when it comes to the next career move it should monitor onair contributors research shows that men are more likely to feature as experts and women as mothers and victims there should be targets for equal representation at various levels and management pay should be linked to the achievement of those targets so that this can no longer be an agenda item that is skipped over with a sigh those would be my first steps but i bet we could find some experts who could suggest better ones some of those experts might even be women the paradox of it all is that during my time at bbc scotland we were continually told that we needed to attract more female viewers and listeners to our news programmes if the bbc addresses the gender imbalance in its newsrooms id be willing to bet that a more balanced audience would follow eleanor bradford is a former bbc scotland health correspondent,2018-01,former colleague

the bbc is in a hole and it is time it stopped digging in july came the revelation that twothirds of its highest paid onscreen talent is male in october its cumbersome bureaucratic level staff pay grading system was found to be shot full of holes and a average gap between men and womens earnings was exposed better than average blustered the corporation but it has settled unfair pay claims and there are as many outstanding now its rewards structure for onscreen news stars has been described as secretive and unstructured in a second report from pricewaterhousecoopers published on tuesday this report is as bad as the last it reveals an overall gender gap of that rises to more than among less glamorous staffers like news correspondents yet it confidently asserts there is no evidence of gender bias in pay decisions merely some anomalies that need addressing the director general tony hall is clinging to the maxim that absence of evidence is the same as evidence of absence on wednesday mps on the culture media and sport committee will be able to test his claim and examine the quality of the data on which it is based bbc women representing of the presenters and correspondents including mishal husain martha kearney and jane garvey says it was not consulted on the reports scope terms of reference or methodology it has submitted evidence to the committee that should shame senior bbc managers including personal submissions from women describing the panicked response of managers after the top pay gap was confirmed last summer some found pay rises being pressed upon them after years of demanding equal pay but no compensation for lost benefits like pension contributions others report being offered oneoff bonuses for hard work while requests for equality with male colleagues were still denied the nujs evidence to the committee quotes samira ahmed the bbc radio arts presenter describing the feeling of being paid much less for the same work for years as though bosses had naked pictures of you in their office and laughed every time they saw you nearly years after it was introduced the rate of progress towards genuinely equal pay for men and women and black and minority ethnic workers is still shockingly slow showing to the satisfaction of a tribunal judge that a man is paid more than a woman because and only because of their gender is invariably difficult underlying causes are emerging as more careful analysis of increasing amounts of data reveals patterns like the sudden opening up of the gap after motherhood occupational crowding often leads to higher pay for men than women we know that gender discrimination and disadvantage does not begin and end with the pay packet more and more research on reasons behind inequality underlines that pay legislation is necessary but not sufficient a gap persists even when work is likeforlike and other factors are controlled and that must be addressed by the beginning of april all larger employers must have submitted gender pay audits to the government the rate of submission so far is alarmingly slow and the quality of data is already being challenged the government must be sure that all the claims have the evidence to support them but change is never just about the law and example matters the bbcs response of tinkering with the most glaring injustices by cutting the pay of a few famous men and offering rises to some women is an inadequate answer to the extent of inequality that has now been exposed this article was amended on january because an earlier version said the

the amount carers earn when starting out with the council is below minimum wage jane i wanted a change and to foster in my local area and community fostering with a private agency means the children you care for can come from anywhere that makes continuity difficult when they have to leave the ties they have made in the area with the agency it was around for a mother and baby and for teenagers normally with the council its about for a mother and baby ive only been with leicestershire for a few months but now they are telling me that my pay might go down which would mean a difference of about a week the amount carers earn when starting out with the council is around thats below minimum wage its diabolical you get more support with a private agency and outofhours help is more efficient but i want to remain in the area local dentists and schools are important for the kids and give them the stability they need councils can offer free school dinners and transport but they could save more money by cutting back on the amount they pay out to agencies id like to stay with the council but i may end up moving back to an agency if the pay scales change jane transferred to leicestershire county council from private agency fostering solutions after six years when the council offered to match the agency pay foster carers should be supported and paid a national flat rate married couple john and amanda all independent fostering agencies should be notforprofit organisations at the moment they charge excessive fees and make huge profits for their owners weve been with the council for two years and have experience in emergency respite and longterm fostering being a foster carer is all about the children its about making them happy safe making sure they are medically well and part of a loving family whether a foster carer works for a local authority or an agency the problems are the same they should be supported and we should have a national flat rate regardless of who you work for i dont think we necessarily need to put more money into fostering but we could be more efficient with our current resources provide a professional base and youll attract more people and the children will benefit the most we should start with the children and end with the children everything else is neither here nor there john and his wife amanda were with private agency clifford house fostering for three years where they earned a week when they heard it had been taken over by venture capital group sovereign capital they joined worcestershire county council here a level one carer is paid around per week and a level two carer now im with an agency i get much better personal support claire i had shortterm emergency and outofhours foster placements but moved from the council because i didnt feel like i was getting enough support when i was with hackney council the social workers changed quite a lot id ring them and there wouldnt be anyone there or they wouldnt know who your kids are now im with an agency i get much better personal support we have a social worker visiting every four weeks theres help on the phone and the kids get to go on more trips hackney paid a week for a kid aged between and with nexus its you might get paid more at an agency but you dont get as much help with christmas birthdays and holidays in hackney they would pay around for christmas and birthdays but at the agency its only and fostering is hard work but its the best job just to see a small change in a kid is great my birth children are amazing and i think fostering has played a big part in that its a commitment and you need a big support network to help with the child in placement with nexus i feel like they listen and treat carers like partners id never go back to a council claire was a foster carer for hackney council in east london for years she joined nexus fostering in when we worked with local authorities there were some poor working practices sarah after i became pregnant with my youngest child we took a break from fostering when we returned six years ago we decided it was time for an independent agency at the moment we receive between a day for the children in our care the agency acts as another voice to speak up for the needs and wishes of the child as well as ensuring our well being as foster carers when we worked with local authorities we experienced some poor working practices where there was no consideration for the children or their carers also the changeover of social workers with local authorities wasnt good for the children at least the agency is consistent it is a real privilege to be able to care for children who cannot be at home for any reason being able to see children grow in every aspect of their development under your careful nurturing is a real gift it however has a lot of challenges such as accessing the resources and support needed working in a task oriented culture and knowing that you are considered to be a fellow professional sarah and her husband have over years of experience as foster carers they fostered with three local authorities in london before joining adoption and fostering charity tact six years ago when i was with the council a lot of the support went stephen i decided to transfer to an agency not just because of the money although the cuts were making it increasingly difficult to provide a good standard of care for the child i look after it was the whole package of care and support that was being cut fostering is not just a job you sacrifice your whole lifestyle you never have a break from it but we do it because we want to make a difference to a childs life i did a lot of research i was really impressed that foster care associates fca focus on supporting matching and keeping children in their placements a lot of local authorities are so stretched that they just want the child placed as quickly as possible i have already noticed a difference and feel much more supported when i was with the council a lot of the support went i felt down by them but at fca i get a lot of phone and email support and there are regular events with other foster carers i feel they care about me and the children i look after stephen fostered with west yorkshire council for over a decade after the council made large cuts to the allowances paid for each child a week and only paid

kate gummer has been a foster carer in sheffield for years providing a longterm home to children in care aged eight to normally gummer fosters two children but last autumn she felt she needed to reduce her caring responsibilities temporarily and just look after one child i was suffering with what i call empathetic exhaustion i had had a couple of very difficult shortterm placements youngsters who had had awful early years experiences and the cumulative effect of constant care understanding and therapeutic parenting wore me down when you are living with children who have gone through some sort of trauma as a foster carer you often end up holding some of that trauma for them because you are trying to find a way to help and empathising is an important part of that gummer wants more support from social workers and has decided to move from the council to a private agency to get it sheffield fostering service is not able to meet my support needs she explains i need some form of regular therapeutic support the small private agency she is due to transfer to offers one hours therapy per child per week one hours therapy per week for her and one hour joint family support per week for the first weeks of a placement that was the biggest pull for me she explains in addition gummer says the small size of the agency means the social workers it employs should have more time to spend with the children in contrast she says the support from the council was inadequate i felt very frustrated by the poor quality of contact between the child and their social worker i felt this left the child unknown and without a voice gummer is far from alone in believing that independent fostering agencies ifas can better look after carers than local authorities last months report by the education select committee found that the government needed to do much more to support fostering families robert halfon chair of the education select committee said our inquiry showed it is clear that too many foster carers are not adequately supported neither financially nor professionally in the vital work that they do rachel harrison lead officer for foster carers at the gmb trade union says agencies social workers have lesser workloads and so are better able to look after their foster carers but the issue is that they end up costing councils a lot more money the guardian has this week revealed that the growth of ifas in england many of which are run for profit by private equity investors is pushing up the cost of placing children with families by hundreds of millions of pounds each year the governments imminent stocktake of foster care should provide the latest cost analysis sir martin nareys review of residential care for the government found that in some areas private sector agencies charge more than the local authority spends on its own foster carers his findings echo a report by consultancy impower which found that each inhouse foster placement typically cost councils per year less than the average agency placement some ifas often also offer golden hellos of up to to encourage carers to leave their councilrom the numbers of young people placed with ifaregistered foster carers rose by to compared to a increase in those placed with local authority registered carers to gummer will not get a golden hello but she will earn more sheffield city council pays her per week in fees and per week allowances for each child under and per week for over s providing the quality of care young people deserve brings significant financial worries she says its difficult to afford a cinema trip or to go out for pizza ive also just had to give up my gym membership she expects to be per week better off with the agency that means i can get my roof fixed and maybe even get a new secondhand car as mine needs replacing gummer is not the only one feeling the pinch according to research by the fostering network charity in of councilregistered foster carers said the allowances they received met the full cost of looking after children by just did and threequarters of foster carers said the fees paid to them were poor or needed improving meanwhile the bigger private sector agencies appear to be raking it in figures from corporate watch show that eight private sector foster care agencies made m in profits in its using money that should be for the most vulnerable children in society says sarah anderson chair of the foster care workers branch of the independent workers union of great britain impower calculated that increasing the proportion of local authorityregistered foster placements from the national average in of to would save councils m a year some local authorities are already fighting back in leeds concerted action to attract support and retain foster carers seems to be bearing fruit helen hayden lead member for children and families at leeds city council says foster carers are a valued part of the team we treat and view foster carers as professionals she says carers are allocated a dedicated fostering social worker and comprehensive training is provided alongside carer support groups educational support for children in their care and therapeutic support as a result we have very few breakdowns in placements says hayden all foster carers registered with the council and the children have free gym membership the children also receive free swimming lessons at the citys leisure centres the council says fees and allowances are on a par with or better than at independent agencies foster carers receive per week in allowances per child on top of fees of up to per child for the most skilled and from april foster carers will get a increase in fees backdated to october the strategy seems to be paying dividends we have brought back foster families from independent agencies since says hayden overall the number of foster carers registered with the council is up since and no carers have transferred from the councils service to an ifa in the past four years the council estimates it costs on average per week more to place a child through an ifa thats a year says hayden this means that by having more foster carers inhouse leeds has saved at least m in peterborough the council has outsourced its fostering service tact the adolescent and childrens trust the uks largest fostering and adoption charity was appointed in april to run all the councils fostering and adoption services in a year deal worth m andy elvin chief executive of tact hopes to reduce the use of ifas from of placements to under elvin says social workers will be

money to repair my house and provide me and the children with more support then id stay a spokeswoman for sheffield ciity council says our foster carers do an incredible job for hundreds of children

foster care agencies run for profit by private equity investors are pushing up the cost of placing vulnerable children with families local authorities have warned concern about independent foster agencies ifas came as a guardian investigation revealed that one of the largest firms in the sector channelled money to luxembourg via a complex loan arrangement analysis of the accounts of several private equityowned ifas which charge councils to match children with foster carers also reveals multimillionpound dividends paid to investors and sixfigure salaries for directors the details emerged ahead of the governments national fostering stocktake which is due to report on the sector ahead of the report councillors and foster care veterans voiced concern at the effect of ifas on council budgets ifas typically pay carers higher fees than local authorities and sometimes offer golden handshakes worth up to to poach them from rival agencies david simmonds a conservative councillor who is vicechair of the local government association lga said that if cash constrained local authorities could pay carers more to retain them they would end up spending less overall what appears to be happening is that the agencies see they can make money out of something local authorities have to supply by law he said they offer carers more and then charge the local authority double or triple what they would pay inhouse and make a nice bit of profit from the agencys point of view its a nolose situation the shortage of carers means there isnt competition so prices dont come down its a market that isnt functioning to the detriment of the state carers are in short supply but councils are legally obliged to find a foster home for vulnerable children meaning they are often forced to turn to ifas if they dont have inhouse carers fees paid to ifas per foster child are almost higher than those paid directly to carers registered with the council according to a report by government adviser sir martin narey with the average fee per week rising to for ifas from for councilregistered carers narey said the gulf was very large even if there were some reasons other than profit to explain it such as ifaregistered carers taking on more challenging cases according to coventry city council its ifa placements cost on average per year compared with for councilregistered placements the number of children living with foster carers registered to ifas rose to from to according to government figures compared with a rise in children with carers registered directly to the council to liverpool councillor barry kushner said the cost of paying inflated fees to ifas had cost the council an extra m in one year he said the council has begun trying to lure foster families back inhouse by offering incentives such as reduced council tax training and free leisure centre passes a spate of mergers and acquisitions among foster care firms typified by last years m tieup between the national fostering agency and rival acorn has fuelled concern about ifas andy elvin chief executive of fostering and adoption charity tact warned that consolidation would reduce competition we are moving towards some de facto monopolies or potential cartels of private ifa supply he said as companies get bigger and have more power over local authorities they hold more of the supply this can lead to costs being increased to local authorities because they need the placements the merger between acorn and nfa created a vast fostering company owned by private equity group stirling square capital partners sscp analysis by the guardian of accounts filed at companies house reveals that the firm uses a corporate structure that transfers money to a parent company in luxembourg sscp owns the firms via subsidiary sscp spring topco which had annual revenues of m but lost m after hefty interest payments on loans this included an interest payment on a m loan from the luxembourg parent company interest payments have the effect of reducing a companys taxable profit the accounts also show that sscp spring topcos highestpaid director took home for the year the guardian has contacted stirling square for comment

rate of sister company pics paid m interest on borrowings including m of loans from investors some of whom were company directors the highest paid director took home including pension contributions sovereign said the highinterest loans were normal practice and that it paid all applicable tax elvin said any money leaving the system is not being spent directly on vulnerable children therefore all dividends bonuses etc are being paid directly from taxpayers money allocated to be spent on children in care the private sector is not driving down cost through competition it is not driving up

a couple of weeks after the weinstein revelations the emails started coming some werent even personalised hello prominent woman in the video games industry i am a reporter trying to unmask sexual predators is this something you would be willing to talk about if not do you know anyone else who will women working in video game development and media especially those who are outspoken about gender equality in the games industrys notoriously unbalanced workforce which according to the most recent independent game developers association survey is male have been getting these missives for months there is nothing inherently wrong with a journalist trying to dig up leads its what we do but on this topic at this time it is extremely misguided women do not want to be pressed to share their trauma and if women in the video games industry do decide to speak out they will do so on their own terms not at the insistence of the press the video games industry has not yet had its metoo moment there have been rumblings last year ign the biggest video games and entertainment site dismissed one employee and more recently its editorinchief after a former member of staff alleged harassment and the companys editorial workforce demanded a change in its working culture another games media outlet vox medias polygon fired a video producer after it came to light that hed been sending sleazy messages to women in the games industry for years on the development side studio heads at french outfit quantic dream denied accusations from employees that management had fostered a toxic and sexist working environment but there has been no mass movement of women coming forward with their stories of workplace harassment much to the frustration it would seem of reporters working in the space whose fishing activity has only intensified there are extremely good reasons for this it is not funnily enough because there is no workplace harassment in the video games industry its because women dont want to publicly relive painful things that have happened to them its because any woman who goes public with allegations of this variety opens herself up to further harassment victimblaming and unpleasant professional ramifications its because the consequences of bad reporting on this subject exemplified by the fallout from babenets stomachchurning story about aziz ansari are huge even when sources are anonymised there are so few women in the games industry that it would hardly be impossible for trolls to discover their identities and wreak retaliatory havoc there is enormous risk and sacrifice involved in coming forward on top of whatever emotional damage the original abuse itself might have wrought theres also the fact that actually women in the games industry have been talking about sexist working culture for a very long time the reasonwhy movement back in is one of many many examples of moments where women from all over the games industry have shared their experiences of discrimination and their reasons for persisting nonetheless though it is encouraging that people are finally starting to listen it is more than a little galling that they are only doing so now it would have been helpful for people to listen during gamergate a harassment campaign that almost exclusively targeted women working in video games under the smokescreen of ethics in video games journalism and whose effects are still very much felt a dispiriting proportion of the games press which should have stood up for women without hesitation chose to either ignore it until it became unavoidable or engage in prevaricating instead is it any wonder that women do not trust reporters with their stories now why does it feel like the games industry is only interested in what women have to say when its about their trauma the new york times investigation into harvey weinstein represented over a year of work and trustbuilding you dont just pull this kind of reporting out of a hat women in the games industry meanwhile are being approached as potential leads rather than as people who might have been through something horrible the sudden impatience for there to be a reckoning is at odds with the hesitancy that the games press has generally displayed when talking about the longrunning and hardly secret problems with sexism in the industry anyone looking for further evidence of that culture would do well to start by listening to men rather than hassling women for names of bad actors the games industrys metoo movement may yet happen when it does it will be on womens terms

strap yourselves in kids its about to get bumpy the cautionary tale of aziz ansari has split the room the comedian has become an emblem of something whether thats aggressor hypocrite bad shag or wronged man only netflix can decide whatever your stance its hard to deny the heterosexual boat has truly been rocked men are scared what are the rules where are the lines whos even in charge here women are getting cold feet the movements getting out of hand she went too far with this and the real kicker what an insult to real survivors no one said a sexual revolution was gonna be easy but the ansari fallout should be seen for what it is collateral damage of a bigger brighter historical movement and not its final destination lets get real about what a social movement actually is it does not come organised strategised streamlined and clean it does not come neatly presented by experienced journalists and authorised by legal ombudsmen its messy its chaotic it ebbs and flows and expands and retracts because its a human phenomenon it takes place in the streets and in unofficial publications and is propelled most crucially by a collective imagination and historically the imagination of a movement is led by the young this is where we are now the hard bit the exciting bit the bit that counts donald trump in the white house mobilised us harvey weinsteins fall and the metoo movement vindicated us and demanded our testimony now thanks to cat person or aziz ansari or years of terrible unacceptable sex we should be allowed to conceive of a new sexual landscape without fretting about one comics career or emasculating a generation of men in the bedroom no one is coming for french mens handcuffs mesdames he can still throw you around the bedroom and pull your hair if that wets your whistle the endgame is not filling the jails with innocent rapists but more fun more joy more sex even of the good kind you know the kind where both people get to come women do not cope well with male discomfort perhaps the fear of possible retribution unsettles us deep down we know better than to shake the hornets nest the feminist comic deborah franceswhite brilliantly sums up the genetic disposition of women when faced with danger not fight or flight but freeze and friend and so before the backlash comes the caution if you listen closely enough were being told to rein it in the most persuasive voices are the maternal ones respectable measured elders like caitlin flanagan in the atlantic she admits her reaction is generational but unpicks each action of ansaris accuser grace as shallow desperate cruel weak ansaris actions are left unexplored no need to tell him bad luck son you chose the wrong moment to claw a millennial you picked up at an industry party no matter he was riding high off the back of a feminist movement that gave his unmacho femaleally persona the platform to make him rich and famous of course thats gonna sting in the back of a cab with the bad taste of unwanted cock in your mouth the poor girl didnt even get to finish her dinner no flanagan could not relate to the new world this girl imagined for herself or the community of young women who received her testimony with empathy instead she recalled an era where girls would physically fight off unwanted sexual advances perversely reminiscing about an old kind of strength instead of yearning for a new kind of freedom it is no coincidence that martin luther kings i have a dream is the seminal speech on social justice or that john lennons imagine is its theme tune dreaming imagining longing are not just pastimes of the aimless poet but the secret weapon of every purposeful social reformer the vital mental agility of young women the ones we mock for their safe spaces and their triggered responses keeps their pain near not because they prize victimisation but because they exist closest to the new reality their hands are beginning to shape they keep their trauma present as they actively purge the culture of harm in that last unpoliceable realm the space between the sheets all women have been a little bit raped said the comedian amy schumer and we all laughed because its true what to do about it exactly thatll take a minute forgive us for not having the blueprint written and mailed out to everyone weve been a bit busy doing of the worlds work for of its income so the new mans journey has begun in earnest and with a bit of a jolt though to be fair he had been procrastinating for a while he will have to keep looking beyond the verbal and nonverbal cues of his intimates piecing together a new sexual conduct from messaging he receives in cultural corners the news comedy music conversation his sisters his friends his colleagues it need not be the death of sex women enter sexual encounters with an unbelievable raft of quiet concerns violence and rape on one side of the spectrum shaming pregnancy a debilitating bout of cystitis on the other if we can continue to live a sexual life alongside our private fears he can incorporate the consideration of her genuine enjoyment into his repertoire you may say im a dreamer but i really do believe in him lets at least permit ourselves to picture life in a new reality wandering the spaces men roam freely a strange pub perhaps or india or the nighttime imagine going to a nightclub on your own just because you like the music imagine boarding a bus not noticing it was full of men because you were enjoying the view imagine a really good orgasm as standard imagine the decent bloke you know being the norm not the

working parents are struggling to juggle the pressures of their jobs and family life with many deliberately stalling their careers or rejecting a new opportunity in a bid to restore balance a survey shows the modern families index found almost half of uk parents and carers said work affected their ability to spend time together as a family with two in five saying it prevented them from being able to say goodnight to their children often or all the time a similar proportion said work commitments meant they could not help their children with their homework the report published by working families and bright horizons found evidence of a parenthood penalty which it says was preventing parents from fulfilling their economic potential the chief executive of working families sarah jackson called the findings a wakeup call for uk plc she said for mothers and for fathers becoming a parent looks like a bad career move because the norm for people who want to get ahead is still to show up early leave late and be on email out of hours and parents have less time to give putting them at a disadvantage the index was based on responses from working parents and carers with at least one child aged or younger who lives with them at least part of the time nearly one in five said they had deliberately stalled their careers for family reasons one in ten said they had refused a new job and the same proportion said they had rejected a promotion at the same time many are working extra hours two in five fulltime employees said they were working more hours than contracted and almost a third of those were working an extra seven hours equivalent to an additional day each week a third of parttime employees said they were working extra hours of whom were putting in sufficient hours to qualify as fulltime the report suggests the right to request flexible working has not had the desired impact less than half of parents felt that it was a genuine option in their workplace and a similar proportion said they did not work flexibly the responses also suggest flexible working is not a panacea with over a third of those who do so saying they feel burntout all or most of the time and many who work flexibly in theory said they had restricted or no control over where they worked or their working hours jackson said we need humansized jobs that allow parents to fulfil their labour market potential and give families back the time together they need to thrive,2018-01,working parent struggling juggle pressure job family life many deliberately stalling career rejecting new opportunity bid

adoption has become a runaway train impossible for individual social workers to stop according to an independent inquiry into adoption law in the uk the exhaustive twoyear inquiry which canvassed evidence from social workers adult adoptees adoptive parents and birth parents across the uk has raised the alarm over practices that favour adoption over alternative care options seeking to help children stay with their birth parents the british association of social workerss basw independent adoption inquiry is the first to investigate the role of social workers in adoption with a focus on ethics and human rights and has called for a significant rethink and review of adoption law the uk has the highest number of adoptions in europe and is one of just three eu countries that allow forced or nonconsensual adoptions where children are adopted against the wishes of their birth parents the inquiry examined these issues and looked at our rationale for being the only country in europe to have a uniform rule forbidding any direct contact between adopted children and their birth and foster families ruth allen chief executive for basw said adoption can be highly successful providing children with stable loving homes and adoptive parents with the experience of creating the family they want birth families may consent to adoption and recognise the value to their biological child however the inquiry explores the complex realities of adoption for many people particularly in nonconsensual adoption with mixed outcomes and experiences for all involved which raise questions about what the report calls a dominant happy ever after narrative at the inquirys launch on thursday night a mother who had her children taken from her at birth said there were no support services preventive help or childrens centres available to help her cope and that most were being closed because of funding cuts social workers said the adoption process was not working and that there was not enough postadoptive support for birth or adoptive families there was also call for government to not only fund the system properly but to be more open over its data the government needs to supply a breakdown of figures so we can see how many children who are adopted then go back into the care system because of a breakdown with the adoptive family often through lack of postadoption support which is morally wrong but also doesnt make sense financially said allen adoption has been promoted by government policy in england in recent years as the best solution for children from vulnerable families the former prime minister david cameron and the current environment secretary michael gove have both publicly supported adoption as a public good and the best decision for children but the inquiry painted a far less rosy picture often at the early helppoints a case is seen as an adoption case because adoption is so high profile one senior social worker said a permanent solution for the child has been hijacked to mean adoption the childs right to adoption adoption becomes a runaway train and impossible for individual social workers to stop court processes can feel like a fait accompli for birth families the inquiry also came to the damning conclusion that social works professional ethics are not routinely and transparently used to inform adoption practice one acute ethical concern repeatedly expressed by experts was that the impact of austerity on wider social policies has directly led to increased rates of adoption among already disadvantaged families the enquiry explored how a rights and ethics perspective is not routinely embedded in social work practice or in statutory guidance said allen for example adoption should never be an intervention primarily for family poverty or because parents have care and support needs that are not being adequately met and yet cuts to family support and social work services were a recurring theme with less available for earlier interventions that could support children to stay at home safely this means the rights of children and their parents are being breached thanks to austerity measures in public services which continue to undermine preventive and supportive services for families allen also questioned the grounds for governments promotion of adoption above other care options there is a dearth of information and meaningful longitudinal research to inform policy and social work practice on adoption she said without this information the arguments made for adoption in its current form and current policy are insufficiently evidenced,2018-01,adoption ha become runaway train impossible individual social worker stop according independent inquiry adoption law uk exhaustive twoyear inquiry canvassed evidence

has it really only been a touch over three months since the first tranche of weinstein allegations aired in the mainstream media it feels like a lifetime in the meantime ordinary men and women are trying to process it all up for grabs is everything from does this mean i cant enjoy master of none or house of cards anymore to reframing the conduct of your drunk boss on a work business trip to realising that you stand in quite different places to some friends on these issues to discovering that almost every woman you know has a metoo story how we talk about it all among ourselves is much messier and more emotional than the cleareyed essays and hot takes suddenly filling the feminist canon ive kept a rough diary of the last few months of the conversations ive had with friends colleagues and strangers about this moment in time it has been like a drone flying overhead trying to film a fastmoving target the picture will only ever be partial but this is what we talk about when we talk about metoo south coast nsw midoctober harvey weinstein stories in the new york times and the new yorker have just started to appear about harvey weinsteins treatment of women by the second week of this story cycle the few stories about weinstein have become a torrent in all more than women will accuse weinstein of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to rape some of the stories that make me saddest are the stories of women ive never heard of whose careers were ruined before they even began in midoctober i go to a th for a weekend in the country with a group of a dozen women most of whom i dont know weinstein is all we can talk about we talk into the night sharing experiences everyone is fired up a strange alchemy takes place that weekend and i realise ive talked about solidarity before but never really felt it until now the realisation is this our experiences which we had assumed all our lives to be discreet personal and our own are part of a collective female experience the catcalls the date rape the unequal pay arent an individual experience that we as individuals bear alone but baked into the structure of our society once you see it you cant unsee it theres something happening here but what it is aint exactly clear melbourne late october metoo many thousands of women are posting their metoo stories on social media sharing their experiences of sexual assault harassment and discrimination the sheer volume of stories threatens to overwhelm its like every woman youve ever known and all the ones you dont have some buried trauma i meet a colleague for a drink we talk about metoo she is bristling with rage shes angry at all men men on the next table to us are being boorish and rude to the waitress we mightnt have noticed it so much before but now everything gleams with new and awful significance were seeing the entitlement now to call out from a car to take what you want to order others around there is a cleansing energy to our rage and a thrilling sense that we are all actually in the middle of a bona fide social movement but another friend is annoyed by the nascent movement oh for godsakes its not all men most men are very nice shh you cant say that i warn her the thing thats started feels very powerful pushing away all in its path already men i know have been shut down on social media for saying not all men its like the voice of the metoo women each singular and unique but at this point choral it is a pure painful primal scream sydney early december louis ck kevin spacey matt lauer glenn thrush garrison keillor roy moore i catch up with a criminal barrister friend for a drink after work we talk about how gross louis ck is how gross kevin spacey how swiftly theyve been dealt with but in his corner of the legal profession the criminal bar there is none of the prurience or the euphoria instead his colleagues are appalled theyre not appalled at the men per se they are appalled at the frenzy at the chaos catharsis and destruction that is characterising this early stage of the metoo movement whatever happened to the presumption of innocence people are being tried on social media and losing their reputations and jobs there is no due process the whole foundation of the legal system is based on innocent until proven guilty refined for centuries you cant just chuck a whole system but yet that is exactly what is happening these men are all entitled to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence said my friend matt lauer glenn thrush garrison keillor roy moore what roy moore hes a gross child molester my friend shoots me a reminder across the table alleged there is this thing we learned in law school a cornerstone of the whole system it is better that guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer january facebook messenger aziz ansari the sex scandals come pretty much daily now they range from eliza dushku alleging she was molested by a stunt coordinator on the set of true lies when she was to multiple women accusing actor james franco of misconduct to the us olympic gold medallist simone biles accusing team doctor larry nassar of sexual assault to whether actors on woody allen films should apologise to whether matt damon should just shut up and thats just this week men and women are asking each other what do you think its like we have to keep checking one anothers temperatures feeling for a fever with weinstein of course everyone thinks hes a monster but other situations provoke more discussion such as glenn thrush garrison keillor michael fallon and those accused of misconduct who have denied allegations including geoffrey rush what do you think is code for do you think this counts as assault because right now some men dont seem to know or else frame an encounter very differently from women television actor and comedian aziz ansari was surprised that the encounter written about this week in babe was not consensual im so sad to hear this he responded to his dates text the day after the encounter clearly i misread things in the moment and im truly sorry a male friend messages me on sunday about ansari him let me know what you think me i dislike knowing his technique for fingering he comes across as a total douche bad for his rep that story but should have been sourced should have shut it down and called her an uber after she said she was uncomfortable not got her to give him a blowie what you reckon him yeah sounds like he was a dick just wanted sex and was v pushy about it the piece itself is weird though the whole thing about him serving her red not white wine and how at the end she identifies herself as a victim of sexual assault but also maybe she could have translated her intense discomfort and violation into leaving which is not to defend him being pushy and not caring about her feelings me there surely is a middle ground tho btw fucking and leaving like seinfeld and making out in a respectful way him does it ruin master of none for you me yes does it u him i guess im still processing it its not nice to know he can be a selfish dickish dude but i dont think hes a rapist or anything either my favourite master of none scene happens in an uber its a long scene almost four minutes ansaris alter ego dev has just realised that hes in love with a friend whos engaged the camera stays on his face as the expression of recognition and loss flickers across it weve all been there could all this be as small and significant as putting the camera on the woman in the back seat of the uber instead telling the

parents are being forced to subsidise the governments flagship childcare policy which offers free hours at nursery for three and fouryearolds a survey has suggested nurseries have long complained that the hourly rates paid by the government are too low and a poll by the preschool learning alliance has indicated they are clawing money back by charging for meals nappies and trips and in some cases raising fees for younger children the survey the first to be carried out since the policy came into force last september found only a third of places under the scheme were completely free a similar proportion of nurseries said they had increased fees for nongovernment funded hours and introduced or increased charges for goods and services as a consequence neil leitch the chief executive of the preschool learning alliance said its clear from these findings that the governments flagship childcare policy is failing both providers and parents respondents have laid out in black and white that the hours policy is simply not working with a continued lack of adequate funding leaving many with no option but to pass the funding shortfall on to parents this has left parents to pay the price for government underfunding through often unexpected charges for things like nappies food and trips while the government continues to claim that its delivering on its promise of free childcare the children and families minister robert goodwill said last month that in the first term of the new policy children were in a hours place and more than signed up to access the offer in january to be eligible for the scheme both parents must be working for at least hours a week but each earn less than a year parents of three and fouryearolds were already entitled to hours of free childcare before september but nurseries are under no obligation to provide the additional hours the survey of nurseries preschools and childminders found a fifth did not think they would be financially sustainable in a year while said that if the funding rate was not increased it would have a significant negative impact a department for education spokesperson said we are investing a record amount of around bn every year by in childcare and have doubled the free childcare available to working parents to hours a week saving them up to a year per child providers can choose whether to offer hours and what pattern of days and hours they offer parents we have always been clear that government funding is not intended to cover the costs of meals or additional services however while providers can charge

the principle of a labor union is to protect its working members hollywoods largest union sagaftra has more than members its members include the celebrities who grace the red carpets and those heroic women who have spoken out about sexual abuse in recent months it also includes media professionals such as myself who are not celebrities and make up the majority of the membership in recent months we have begun to uncover the culture of sexual abuse in the media and entertainment world and the deep inequities at their root what has been largely overlooked are the thousands of nameless victims of this culture and the institutional failures that supported those abuses our union not only failed to protect us it actively contributed to the culture of silence that facilitates sexual abuse three years ago with the input and support of my peers i authored a petition to the union asking that they address the gender inequities that fuel the culture of sexual abuse that pervades our industry we asked that they commission a targeted committee to tackle the issues of discrimination harassment and assault and the gender inequities that affect our workplace our plea included a list of actionable suggestions for the role the union might take in moving us forward the union was unresponsive i met with leaders of the unions womens committee and though they clearly acknowledged that women were victimized their response was dismissive even hostile perhaps this reaction was driven by committee members acceptance of the limits of their power to fight the established patriarchal order nonetheless we feel the response from the union was not just inadequate but that it contributed to the culture of silence that emboldens perpetrators hollywood is run by men only of its films are directed by women and only are written by women most aspiring actors are women but only of principal roles are available to women this fiercely competitive marketplace makes women increasingly vulnerable at least a third of the roles available to women involve nudity or hypersexualization ours is an industry where nudity required is a sanctioned term of employment for trained unionized professionals the horrific stories of the sex crimes committed by hollywood moguls are shocking but unsurprising given the way hollywood represents women to the world when women are marginalized hypersexualized and excluded from leadership in media the established overwhelmingly male perspectives on women that make it to our screens only serve to reinforce womens suppression and exploitation actors are freelancers with no job security and no hr department looking after us if we say no to the objectification to performative nudity or simulated sex if we reject sexual advances let alone speak out about harassment and assault we may never work in our industry again when we resist we sacrifice our means of supporting ourselves our investments and our dreams the primary tenet of unions is the understanding that individually we are vulnerable but collectively we have great power it is the singular purpose of the union to prevent these devaluations as we look forward to the sag awards this week perhaps we should consider the role of the labor movement in the metoo movement the union must stand by women and all those it is appointed to protect in this struggle this struggle is about workers rights it is about power about the abuse of power that fuels harassment and the culture of silence that perpetuates it but also about the potential of those in power to effect change sagaftra membership has done well to vote women into positions of power in the union but now our union must take bold decisive action and honor the voices of those who have been victimized on its sets they should do so not only for us workers but also for the global audience under hollywoods influence meissa hampton is an active member of the screen actors guild and new york women in film and television

i am not an aziz ansari fan ive never watched his standup ive never watched master of none and brace yourself i have only seen a handful of episodes of parks and recreation but on sunday while absentmindedly scrolling through twitter i clicked on a headline from babenet titled i went on a date with aziz ansari it turned into the worst night of my life in the article an anonymous photographer going by the name of grace details an encounter with ansari in which she went back to his apartment after a date according to her account he repeatedly made clumsy physical advances and propositioned her for sex despite her resistant body language and verbal requests to slow down and just hang out after taking a long time to process the events grace came to the conclusion that what she experienced was sexual assault and her story has been making rounds on social media with the metoo tag attached i read the article all the way through i felt uneasy but not for the reason i expected when i eventually gathered my thoughts and decided to put them into a thread many people stopped reading after the first tweet or two i was called a victim blamer and a rape apologist i was told i dont understand assault i do this summer i fell asleep in a mans bed after telling him i didnt want to have sex and woke up to him inside of me a few months before that after i passed out at a college party a stranger stuck his fingers inside my unconscious body and used my limp hand to get himself off some time during the aftermath of those two events my nowformer boss who had years to my kept me after work grabbed my waist and tried to kiss me these are my experiences and they provide the lens through which i view all discussions of sexual assault they are the reasons that when i read the ansari article and the discussion surrounding it something felt off because i have also experienced the kind of situations grace described and while they can be distressing and confusing and humiliating they are not assault it is important to talk openly about all the various subtle ways in which misogyny manifests itself but using assault as a catchall term feels reductive because it overlooks the nuances of an incredibly complex issue while i dont think such encounters should be excluded from the metoo narrative i think we need to avoid discussing them in overly simplistic binary terms like nice guy versus rapist and good sex versus assault onesizefitsall characterizations like these are unhelpful because they fail to recognize the fact that most men and most sexual encounters fall somewhere in between for example in the months following harvey weinsteins fall i have seen many wellmeaning people echo the supposedly feminist rule that consent can only be given when sober never while intoxicated i am well aware that alcohol can be a form of coercion and a contributor to assault and that people who are too drunk to know what theyre doing shouldnt be taken advantage of ive been assaulted while drunk but ive also had drunk sex i fully agreed to i said in the thread feminism means allowing women the agency to tell the difference instead of treating them like children who need to be coddled with arbitrary standards for acceptable intimacy people have asked me if youre all about womens agency isnt it enough that this woman felt assaulted unfortunately no not when it becomes a matter of public accusation assault is not a feeling discomfort is a feeling embarrassment and hurt and anger are all feelings but assault has to have an objective definition because of the legal and social ramifications that come with it when we act as though disrespect harassment assault and rape are all different words for the same thing the conversation starts to lose its legitimacy after the tweets above people accused me of excusing such actions as acceptable because they are common but my point is precisely the opposite graces descriptions of ansaris behavior made headlines because he is a household name but it isnt limited to powerful famous men these things happen all the time and are indicative of a broader social problem which hinders proper communication between men and women im not defending ansari i wrote im concerned with the eagerness to call every man whos ever made a woman feel uncomfortable an abuser instead of trying to understanddismantle the larger structures which play into mens inability to sense discomfort and womens inability to say no and then added some of the most candid and insightful points ive seen about this story have come from women who have argued that for a lot of men sexual aggression is something that has been ingrained in them from a young age they are socialized through the examples of other men not just those around them but in tv movies and music heterosexual sex has long been portrayed as a kind of catandmouse game in which the woman is expected to play coy and the man is expected to wear her down until she gives in this is an unhealthy and dangerous dynamic and it needs to change but if our main approach is assigning facile labels to individuals rather than frankly examining root causes it never will framing this as an aziz ansari problem instead of a culture problem gives men the opportunity to distance themselves from it instead of reflecting upon their own attitudes and beliefs proper language and communication are critical not only in these discussions but in the heat of the moment while there are many clearcut cases of men deliberately disregarding womens boundaries there are others where neither person clearly expresses whats going on in their head and both are left trying to fill in the blanks it is not antifeminist to recognize that sometimes human relationships are messy signals feel mixed and misunderstandings occur and it is not victim blaming to say that we need to work harder to empower women to firmly say no when men are acting entitled as well as teaching those men to look for nonverbal cues and ask their partner explicitly how theyre feeling before proceeding i understand what its like to freeze in the moment i am familiar with the feeling of panic when i woke up to a man whose name i didnt know on top of me i kept my eyes closed and my body still instead of fighting back my experience is valid regardless of my inability to find my voice and i believe grace when she says she felt upset and violated i believe she probably felt pressured and she has a right to resent ansari and the larger culture that pressures men to pressure women but her account reveals a grave need for us as a society to emphasize the importance of clear consent to both men and women so that we all have the tools to express when a situation doesnt feel right to us the situation grace described may not be assault but its important to recognize that there is a middle ground that can also be bad we need to hold men to a higher standard without resorting to speaking in absolutes i write about this because as a woman and a survivor i have a stake in the way we talk about sexual assault as the subject matter continues to broaden more than ever we need precise yet nuanced language in order to talk about different kinds of unacceptable behavior i realize i am guilty of occasional oversimplification like anyone else had i known my twitter thread would get so much attention i would have been more delicate about the words i selected calling graces story an awkward experience with an aggressively horny asshole may be just as reductive as calling it an assault a realization i came to after listening to the voices of other women who processed my thoughts and shared their own its easy to talk about these things like they are black and white but some of the most productive discussion comes from acknowledging the gray area tiffany wright is a criminal psychology student at the university of kentucky,2018-01,aziz ansari fan ive never watched standup ive never

it was bound to happen in the midst of women sharing stories of harassment and assault via the metoo movement and a brewing backlash of handwringers wondering if women have perhaps gone too far it was only a matter of time before a publication did us the disservice of publishing a sensational story of a badly behaved man who was nonetheless not a sexual assailant the publication babenet the man aziz ansari the story a coercive dehumanizing sexual interaction its a shame not because these stories shouldnt be told if anything we need to talk more about how pervasive power imbalances benefit men and make sex worse for women but instead of telling this particular story with the care it called for it was jammed into a preexisting movement grounded in the language of assault and illegality it seems to have been reported only because there was a celebrity name attached and not even because the celebrity broke the law or leveraged his power to do wrong but because he was sexist and sexually entitled while despicable thats shaky grounds for broadcasting an individuals sexual playbyplay as a result were arguing about whether aziz ansari is a sexual assailant and missing the more relevant conversation about sex male entitlement and misogyny in the bedroom one of the most gratifying elements of the metoo movement has been the care with which journalists have handled these sensitive claims but little of that journalistic rigor appears to have been applied to the ansari story babe published it as a bizarre hybrid of reported piece and personal essay with editorial comments inappropriately interjected after the woman in the story pseudonymously called grace says she carefully selected an outfit to wear on her date with ansari the reporter adds she showed me a picture it was a good outfit babe did not interview ansari before publishing the piece and barely gave him time just over five hours to respond the right of response is one of the most basic of journalistic requirements when youre publicly accusing someone of wrongdoing journalistic integrity aside this story missed the boat in a much more important way it was only a matter of time before the focus of the metoo movement turned to sexist sexual experiences more generally and here is where there remains much feminist work to be done after centuries of feminist activism it finally seems like most of society understands that sexual assault and harassment are wrong we increasingly understand that its not just about sex but about power and that harassment in the workplace isnt about sexual desire but about womens rights to participate in the workforce what we havent touched on nearly as thoroughly is heterosexual sex for women in a society that still sees sex as primarily about male pleasure that continues to position womens bodies as sexual objects receptacles and standins for sex itself and that encourages sexual aggressiveness in men and congeniality and passivity in women perhaps the best and one of the few pieces written on the sexist power dynamics within consensual sex was by rebecca traister in new york magazine back in when we havent yet agreed that female pleasure and clear enthusiasm are prerequisites for a sexual encounter we lack the ability to peel back the layers of sexual experience and we end up with two bad options accept sexual inequity as just how sex is or just how men are or wedge truly bad sexual experiences into the category of sexual assault reading the story about ansari as well as the new yorkers viral cat person short story about a twentysomethings confusing and often unpleasant flirtation turned sexual encounter with a thirtysomething man i was struck by how much i could relate and how ive heard similar stories from nearly every woman i know girls are raised with a contradictory set of expectations be kind and acquiescent but also be the brakes on male sexual desire we are taught to reflexively say yes except for when were supposed to definitively say no but we dont learn how to know when we want to say either in the graceansari story this dynamic was on full display grace may have been interested in some sort of sexual interaction but she found herself turned off by ansaris actions and communicated that to him verbally and nonverbally pulling her hand away telling him to chill saying i dont want to feel forced in a perfect world grace would have walked out the door but women are so strongly socialized to put others comfort ahead of our own that even when we are furiously uncomfortable it feels paralyzing to assert ourselves this is especially true when we are young when feminists do try to talk about this sexual imbalance we get written off as antisex prudes this is strange because what we actually want is a norm of good sex for everyone involved instead of the status quo of sex as a maleled endeavor centered on male pleasure women seem to have two sexual possibilities yes or no note that men never have to say no means no or even yes means yes theyre the ones posing the question not answering it men arent morons and they know as well as anyone that a woman who is silent physically stiff or pulling away is not exactly aflame with desire but they also know that we are collectively invested in a social script wherein men push to get sex until women acquiesce and so they push even when they know its unwelcome because they can the language of a bad hookup fails to capture the unequal power dynamics and the deep sense of disorientation and betrayal that comes when someone treats you as a hole rather than a person nor does it adequately measure the weight of centuries of misogyny that have shaped our most intimate moments feminists have been on the forefront of tackling these knottier issues of sex consent pleasure and power and so its up to us to lead the way in confronting the private intimate interactions that may be technically consensual but still profoundly sexist this will only happen if we move beyond being reactively sex positive and recognize that human sexual interactions are not always clearcut yes or no good or bad empowering or not either assault and worth worrying about or technically consensual and therefore not at a problem we can we must wade into the messy complicated nature of sex in a misogynist world what a shame that opportunity was

her words to heart the yearold known only by the pseudonym grace told the womens website babenet that the date ansari asked her on shortly after they met in ended up being by far the worst experience with a man ive ever had i believe that i was taken advantage of by aziz she said she told the website she was uncomfortable with how quickly the sexual activity escalated at his apartment after dinner and that he either did not notice or ignored her verbal and nonverbal discomfort she said he moved her hand to his genitals repeatedly and pressured her to perform sexual acts after she told him she was uncomfortable i felt violated she said it took a really long time for me to validate this as sexual assault in a statement given to people on sunday night ansari said in september of last year i met a woman at a party we exchanged numbers we texted back and forth and eventually went on a date we went out to dinner and afterwards we ended up engaging in sexual activity which by all indications was completely consensual the next day i got a text from her saying that although it may have seemed ok upon further reflection she felt uncomfortable it was true that everything did seem ok to me so when i heard that it was not the case for her i was surprised and concerned i took her words to heart and responded privately after taking the time to process what she had said i continue to support the movement that is happening in our culture it is necessary and long overdue the womans texts to ansari the day after their date were supplied to babe in them she wrote last night mightve been fun for you but it wasnt for me you ignored clear nonverbal cues you kept going with advances you had to have noticed i was uncomfortable nothing changed even after i expressed that id like to slow it down ansari responded im so sad to hear this all i can say is it would never be my intention to make you or anyone feel the way you described clearly i misread things in the moment and im truly sorry grace said she felt compelled to speak to the outlet after the golden globes an evening dominated by the metoo movement and the times up campaign to end sexual harassment and abuse in hollywood and beyond ansari accepted the award for best actor in a musical or comedy for his show master of none and wore a times up pin to the ceremony it was actually painful to watch him win and accept an award

last october three months and a lifetime ago tarana burke was sitting in bed scrolling through twitter when some unusual activity caught her eye the yearold had followers and no great taste for social media her work with survivors of sexual violence mainly young women of colour didnt lend itself to public pronouncement twelve years earlier she had set up me too an activist group that she thought in her wildest dreams might one day amount to a me too bumper sticker on somebodys car a kind of bat signal between survivors of sexual violence but that on most days had no public presence at all for her kind of work to be done right she believed most of it needed to be done in the dark what she saw on twitter therefore made burke jump out of her skin ten days earlier harvey weinstein had been spectacularly exposed by the new york times as the subject of multiple accusations of sexual assault and there on screen carrying the hashtag metoo other women had begun sharing their stories burke didnt know that the actor alyssa milano had stumbled on the phrase unaware of its origins and urged survivors of sexual aggression to use it nor could she know that in the coming weeks the me too hashtag would be used more than million times resulting in an extraordinary outpouring of pain and a handful of highprofile men losing their jobs all she knew that night was that someone was using her slogan and this wasnt good social media she says laughing at the understatement is not a safe space i thought this is going to be a fucking disaster burke and i are in the offices of girls for gender equity a nonprofit organisation in downtown brooklyn where she is the senior director congratulations tarana reads a homemade poster on her office door alongside a photocopy of time magazines person of the year cover featuring the silence breakers of metoo fruit picker isabel pascual lobbyist adama iwu actor ashley judd software engineer susan fowler taylor swift and an anonymous hospital worker are pictured while burke was honoured on the inside pages burke has just returned from la after attending the golden globes with michelle williams as she talks she is trying to eat a quesadilla from a polystyrene container while keeping an eye on her phone this is one of the busiest times of year for the organisation she says the world doesnt realise i have a regular job the idea of attending the golden globes was a challenge when michelle called me and said i would love to take you to the golden globes i said why im trying very hard not to be the black woman who is trotted out when you all need to validate your work ouch well michelle is very thoughtful and she said thats not what i want to do instead the two of them came up with the idea of flooding the red carpet with women activists i know some badass women activists from around the country across the spectrum all races and classes different issues and we wondered what it would look like if we used the time usually allotted to redcarpet trivia for our issues there were eight activists in the end a smaller number than they had originally wanted but a signal she says of how women have historically supported each other it is possible that burkes use of the term safe space has already annoyed you its a term that like trigger warning microaggression and rape culture has come to act on some people with the force of a hostile ideology either that or make them glaze over last week in le monde catherine deneuve signed an open letter denouncing the metoo movement as totalitarian and a similar piece ran in the new york times grumbling that it reduced women to the level of victorian housewives no one used the term snowflake but that is the implication that metoo is driven by the same people who think books should be banned and pieces of art they dont like taken down from museums burke it must be said is not this person she is open to criticism she allows that in a movement so large and fastmoving there are inevitable and considerable shortcomings sexual violence happens on a spectrum so accountability has to happen on a spectrum she says i dont think that every single case of sexual harassment has to result in someone being fired the consequences should vary but we need a shift in culture so that every single instance of sexual harassment is investigated and dealt with thats just basic common sense burkes prediction that me too in its latest iteration would be a disaster was not because innocent men might suffer or because the difference between assault and harassment might be lost but because victims of sexual violence might be poorly served by the publicity for two decades burke has done the grinding unglamorous financially ruinous work of setting up programmes to help victims of abuse and that didnt tend to include sharing their status online as it turns out she thinks the destigmatising effect of metoo represents a greater gain than the anticipated risks and if she is unmoved by the accusation that we are in the midst of an overcorrection it is because she has seen what the alternative doing nothing looks like she is also aware of the numbers at one of the first me too workshops burke ran for high schoolage girls in tuskegee alabama she asked the girls to fill in a worksheet noting three things they hadnt known before they came adding that if they needed help they should write me too on the paper doing it that way it wasnt like raise your hand if you want a me too sheet she says we werent asking people to out themselves at the end of the event she and her colleague collected the sheets ill never forget says burke there had been or so girls in the room and we expected around five or six me toos there were and we looked at these things and said oh shit the work that grew out of that is almost too subtle for the volatility of the current moment to bear but it is the basis of what burke hopes me too will become use the hashtag she says but lets talk about why and lets talk about what happens after for burke that means confidencebuilding which is to say establishing the difference between selfesteem and selfworth i think a lot of girlcentred programmes are like we want to build your selfesteem by telling you that youre beautiful and asking you to tell yourself youre beautiful every single day that rang false to me because i can tell you that if you live in a world that devalues you there is nothing to support that message i want girls to feel worthy just for existing because for black and brown girls and actually just for girls its youre worthy if so if youre the smartest girl or if youre the prettiest girl or if you run the fastest there has to be something attached to it to add value to your life and that can become something you become consumed with i have to have this thing i have to be beautiful so for me it was like let me teach you what the world thinks about us and let me teach you what weve seen the world do to girls who look like us and let me teach you why theyre wrong burke is of course not immune to the forces she is teaching the girls to resist although as she points out she is also a single mother of a yearold daughter and has a badass attitude and a lot of life experience still when she logs on to social media and isnt quick enough to filter the comments there it is the thing from which all women are supposed effortlessly to move on because to do otherwise is to be a victorian oh every day she says cheerfully of being attacked by trolls what do they say she smiles they say you are too ugly to rape it is possible that thanks to metoo some women who might usefully have shrugged off a minor grievance may decide to pursue it they may in the language of the times internalise an idea of themselves as victims this is the argument running counter to me too and its one that rightly i think burke laughs out of the room not least because even with the huge swell of metoo testimony it is still not exactly cool to out yourself as a victim of sexual violence what i ask of the argument that there will be collateral damage and some men will be overly punished for minor transgressions i hate that says burke i dont want that to be true im sure it will be true just as there is a small percentage of accusations of sexual assault that are just not true but i tend to pivot away from that because people tend to blow that up and make it the main thing what if shes lying ok but its like a chance she also wont have it that sexual violence and sexual harassment are entirely unrelated things people say theres sexual harassment over here and you shouldnt conflate it with rape she says which is true those are two very different things but theyre on the same spectrum sexual harassment is like the gateway drug its the entry point nothing happens so lets go a little bit further the greater threat is that me too is an invitation for women to whom nothing serious has happened to assume the status of victims burke fairly screams at this of all the critiques and im very open to critiques of this work that one in particular makes me crazy because i think the women who are saying that dont realise what they are doing there is inherent strength in agency and metoo in a lot of ways is about agency its not about giving up your agency its about claiming it what about the temptation to overstate minor transgressions there was a murky time maybe it still exists when people would say well this guy one time touched my boob i dont know if i can say metoo and id say to people i cannot define how you or your body responds to things i cant tell you thats not trauma ive seen cases with young people and families where there is a child who has experienced some form of sexual violence and there areis one set of parents who say thats just kids experimenting and there are others who say im going to get my kid into therapy this is traumatic some of that is based on the response of the child and i think that happens in general its what you respond to it is also the language in which you choose to respond when i first started me too young people had no language to talk about this she says and thats something ive seen change young people have a way to talk about it now hearing the words rape culture doesnt seem foreign to them you can dislike the tone of this language you can find it aggressive or vague or widereaching but there is no doubt that to the person drenched in shame hearing the words rape culture communicates at the most basic level it isnt your fault burke has been through this experience herself as a child she was assaulted by some boys in her neighbourhood and it is one of the things that motivated her to become an activist i grew up in not poverty that sounds a bit tiny tim but you know lowincome workingclass family in a housing project in the bronx we didnt have a ton of resources but my mother was very determined she had me in all sorts of programmes anything she could put me in she did and i read a lot when i was young those were the things that helped change the trajectory of my life and the first glimpses of healing and understanding what had been happening to me as a child came from the literature that i read so i had this out that i saw the girls i worked with did not have the process of healing is one that she would say is never complete and part of burkes discomfort with the spotlight im uncomfortable being the face of this thing i didnt want to be a figurehead is that she says im still dealing with my own stuff she is squeamish about what she calls drily her minutes not least because people keep encouraging her to monetise it ever since this went viral people have been saying you should sell me too tshirts how do i get those tshirts everyone has a stream of income idea in fact there are me too tshirts that burke has for years barely been able to give away until recently every time she wore one out of the house guys would read the slogan on the front and say flirtatiously oh me too me too then they would see the back which read something like end sexual violence now and burke would wait amused for the terrible silence the guys would be like er im so sorry she laughs uproariously anyway she says we dont sell the tshirts because they are a gift a lot of times i hand them out and say whenever youre ready between time magazine and the golden globes burkes profile is continuing to grow and she is determined to rise to the demands inherently having privilege isnt bad she says but its how you use it and you have to use it in service of other people for what feels like the first time the privilege she is referring to is her own and it is the privilege of an extremely large audience now that i have it im trying to use it responsibly she says but if it hadnt come along i would be right here with my fucking me too shirt on doing workshops and going to rape crisis centres she gives a huge laugh the work is the work tarana burke will be speaking at the all about women festival in sydney australia on march,2018-01,last october three month lifetime ago tarana burke wa sitting bed scrolling twitter

after the th or so person sent me the stunningly silly antimetoo letter signed by catherine deneuve and a hundred other french women the actual authorship of which well get to informing me that id love it because finally someone was standing up for sanity i considered a form letter response if the question is whether metoo has gone too far or not far enough the answer is obviously both putting yourself on one side or the other is politically obtuse the innovation of the deneuve statement is to enumerate a new right for men as if they didnt have enough already the right to bother which is regarded by the signatories as indispensable to sexual freedom i understand why my correspondents might have thought this would appeal to me i recently wrote a book about overblown sexual accusations on american campuses in which i too deployed the language of witch hunts i also recounted in print having posed the question during a sexual harassment training workshop but how do you know an advance is unwanted until you try im on record mocking naomi wolfs crusade against harold bloom for having placed his heavy boneless hand on her knee some years ago and the handonknee trope features in the deneuve document as a proxy for whats wrong with the metoo brand of american feminism and its french counterpart balancetonporc out your pigs namely the hatred of men and sexuality my reason for calling the letter silly is that in a moment that demands subtlety these people have brought out a sledgehammer lets collapse all distinctions in the name of freedom putting the move on someone however persistently why not trying to steal a kiss ditto while rape is a crime and the harvey weinstein scandal sparked a legitimate awakening such bodily incursions arent sufficient to makes women prey because were more than simply our bodies write deneuve and her cohort i think i get whats at stake for the women who signed this awkward document along with their recent american metoodoubting counterparts daphne merkin writing in the new york times and claire berlinski writing in american interest both articles were also endlessly forwarded to me by wellmeaning friends telling me how much id love them though i disagree profoundly with them all they get the gone too far part right but miss why the not far enough part is crucial of course i understand the objection that unproven accusations can wreck someones career my book is about such a case and yes a lot of the recent accusations concern stuff people should just get over but im not going to dismiss the political significance of the metoo moment so quickly one also suspects theres more than fellow feeling for accused men animating the backlash the shared anxiety is that the new regulatory spirit encroaches on zones and behaviors we might call sexually liminal jokes innuendos comeons banter dirty books and art merkin worries no one will be able to flirt anymore berlinski frets that creative types like leon wieseltier and louis ck shouldnt be subject to the same boring workplace regulations as ordinary more mortal men for a lot of women especially those of a heterosexual persuasion these inbetween zones make life worth living flirting is where your desirability is confirmed men stealing kisses opens up new possibilities something unexpected and maybe thrilling has happened male sexual license can be hot its the question of where to draw the lines and whether there should be lines drawn at all thats up for grabs and were all drawing them in different places what used to be liminal is getting coopted and redefined that makes us nervous recently i found myself fumingly tweeting in response to michelle deans what makes someone a predator in the new york times that a person shed identified as a powerful literary man whod touched her inner thigh in a bar was an asshole not a predator my feeling was that they were in a bar not at work and the bar is a liminal zone par excellence to be fair the venue may have been a barrestaurant still it was late and drinks were being consumed bars are where we go to drink alcohol let our inhibitions down and see what happens thats the bars social purpose to provide a semblance of license in an overregulated world at the same time the guys hand was on her inner thigh that arguably crossed the line the inner thigh is not a liminal zone theres a reason the hand on the knee has become so emblematic in these debates and such a dividing line in itself the knee is liminal in a way that say the breast is not a pat on the knee can be sexually benign but maybe its not move a few inches up and all bets are off measure the distance from kneecap to crotch divide it in half breach that line and youve entered the zone of the upper thigh i suspect every woman knows precisely where that line on her body is and what trespassing it means a hand placed above that line requires one to make a decision in a way that flirting does not our bodies are zoned there are public areas and private ones parts you can touch without permission such as my hand and parts youre trespassing if you encroach on them without my permission i know all about gray areas i also understand the impulse to rain punishment on bodily trespassers even though my own metoo moments have been largely negligible in fact one of the more memorable of them which as it happens occurred on british soil actually turned out rather well the culprit was a future mp and europe minister the friend of a friend we were in a group of people heading into a restaurant and this guy later to become so politically illustrious who was walking behind me and whom id met maybe minutes before reached forward and goosed me by goosed i dont mean he touched me on my butt but in my butt through the thin skirt i was wearing i turned around and glared at him i was young jetlagged and confused was this customary in britain what hed done felt humiliating i turned ahead and resolutely kept walking whereupon he did it again when i say things turned out well what i mean is that he later went to prison the ostensible reason was for cheating on his expenses but i like to think it was cosmic justice for his crimes against my person inconsequential as they were untraumatized as i was i was delighted to see him put away nonetheless if only for a brief six months overreach criminalizing the right to bother perhaps but why should my body have been enlisted to enlarge his supposed rights which were clearly plentiful enough here was someone perfectly willing to take what wasnt his due in any sphere what the deneuve statement misses with its high flown talk about rights and freedoms is that rights dont exist until theyre conferred politically and the democratic revolutions that substantiated them in france and america didnt confer them equally on everyone it was men who achieved selfsovereignty women didnt even get the vote in france until birth control was illegal until what kind of freedom does a woman have who cant prevent a pregnancy because male politicians have denied her that right its the historical amnesia of the deneuve document thats so objectionable to the extent that womens bodies are still treated as public property by men whether that means groping us or deciding what we can do with our uteruses women do not have civic equality to miss that point is to miss the political importance and the political lineage of metoo the latest step in a centuries long political struggle for women to simply control our own bodies of course some women find bodily violation rewarding and one of those women is catherine millet listed as a coauthor of the deneuve letter though having read her memoir the sexual life of catherine m id like to request a forensic analysis of the two texts for stylistic similarities i suspect millet of having had the largest hand in the enterprise at least the thematic similarities are overwhelming even a philosophically ignorant american recognizes an antiquated cartesianism rearing its head in both in marked contrast to the optimistic american feminism of for example our bodies ourselves devoted as it was to undoing the old mindbody dualism the deneuve document wishes to reinstate precisely the same dualities fueled millets memoir which describes a period in her life devoted to group sex with or men a night on some occasions her body a passive receptacle for gallons of semen in every available orifice when not attending orgies she provided free sexual services to anonymous strangers in the street who could do with her what they chose none of this was especially pleasurable at least not in the bodily sense the gratifications were cerebral and tied to selfabasement as she herself acknowledges it sounds like an especially catholic form of sexual rebellion involving much mortification of the flesh chacun son got as the saying goes and while i might appreciate the contribution to a literary lineage sade bataille genet pauline reage endorsing such a posture in the guise of a political manifesto on behalf of womens freedom is a different matter the mindbody split assumed in the letters supposedly rousing conclusion incidents that can affect a womans body do not necessarily affect her dignity because we are not reducible to our bodies our inner freedom is inviolable reduces all available freedom to the inner sanctum of our minds the authors appear to believe that what happens to the body doesnt happen to the person the political requirement of the postmetoo moment is insisting that control of our bodies is the beginning of freedom not its terminus but a starting point freedom needs to be more than notional it also needs to be embodied laura

harriet harman is being photographed when i arrive at her south london home as i fall to admiring her fabulously billowy skirt she laughs and says ah well you see ive evolved beyond the sharp jacket i dont need to bother about looking authoritative any more now that im a former were now in a new mode which is more well kind of more droopy which suits me perfectly except that eight years after leaving government and since entering parliament from the twilight of her political afterlife harman is about to witness what may well prove to be the most radical achievement of her career the country has been agog over carrie gracies resignation and the bbc gender pay gap but come april thanks almost entirely to the former deputy labour leader most women are likely to discover another industrialscale case of metoo theres going to be an avalanche in april its going to be unbelievable because everybodys going to go bugger this just like carrie this is a really huge structural earthquake and now its all happening she pauses and allows herself a gleeful grin usually policies all fall apart after a while and you think she winces oh god but this one is a cracker theres no doubt about it in april a clause of the equality act will come into force requiring every company of of more employees to publish its gender pay gap were it not for harman the act would instead have mandated companies merely to commission internal equal pay audits and i said no no if you have consultants doing an equal pay audit paid for by the management they will just tell them that its all fine it would have been the worst of all worlds businesses would have had to spend money on it and it wouldnt have moved the needle on equal pay so i went absolutely bonkers and said no lets have pay transparency instead because if people can see whats happening in their workplace that is going to empower people to say weve got to change she faced near universal resistance from the equality sector and even the tuc there was this kind of orthodoxy around the mantra of equal pay audits and i was like that is just a process it doesnt empower the individual woman i just knew that its the secrecy of it that stops anything changing she wanted every woman like gracie to know what her male colleagues earned exactly as carrie says in her resignation letter i always suspected it but it wasnt until the figures were published forcibly that i actually saw that and i thought that is precisely what i was aiming for in the equality act right now the bbcs critics may be having a field day observes harman but come april they may look a lot less holier than thou i dont think the bbc is even unique among broadcasters let alone among the wider economy some companies have already published their gender pay gap and the figures are arresting for phase eight a womens clothes shop the average hourly pay for women is an eyewatering lower than it for men what this does is expose the hypocrisy in lip service because basically everybody says pay gap terrible no no we wouldnt have one of those oh were totally against unequal pay and wed never have it here thats other people so what this does is it blows the lid off the fact that people are saying one thing and doing another politicians too may regret their haste to castigate the bbc i asked the labour party and the tory party to publish their own pay gap years ago i definitely thought that the labour party should do it because it was our policy but they havent published yet so that is going to be a corker when the political parties all reveal their pay gaps it is nearly half a century since the equal pay act was passed the fact that so many employers have paid lip service to it for so long harman reflects may be maddening but now has turned out to be rather useful the argument that its unfair has blossomed on the basis that people didnt think they were going to have to do anything about it people adopted the rhetoric because they felt they had impunity because it was all undercover if you like therefore weve got the rhetoric very nicely developed and now suddenly the facts are marching up to the rhetoric and tapping it on the shoulder and its going to be bang now its the day of reckoning the obvious danger is that the figures will be published women will be furious for a while and nothing will be done before i can even put this to harman however she hands me copies of letters she has written to the heads of the equalities and human rights commission and the tuc she urges the ehrc to publish annual gender pay gap league tables showing the discrepancies both by sector and region to set annual targets for companies to close the gap and to support legal action brought by individual women against those that dont because the act is not supposed to be just revealing the discrimination and the shamefulness of it its about a spur to action so you can say if you work in virgin money why has natwest got less of a pay gap when its the same sector as us so the ehrc is absolutely key in this and the tuc has to place closing the pay gap at the heart of national pay bargaining even if the ehrc and the tuc adopt all of harmans proposals and every organisation in the land dutifully resolved to close its gap how would it be done it would be wildly unrealistic i suggest to expect every employer to magic up funds for whopping pay rises overnight to all its female employees it is hard to bring about change which is deeply entrenched harman agrees and i dont think its easy there isnt a getoutofjailfree card theres not a magic wand you could wave on this but there is no point getting ourselves to this point looking over the edge of the precipice and thinking well were not going to do anything about it so youve got a choice you either perpetuate it or you change it and the transition will be ragged one approach she offers will be to effect change through staff turnover for example when a man earning a year vacates the post the man who replaces him could find the new salary is the point is these jobs change hands so you dont have to cut mens pay that would mean a period when some very highly paid men find themselves working alongside men paid significantly less even those in roles senior to them thats going to cause havoc isnt it the fact that youve got somebody who is your junior earning twice as much as you well thats the way its going to be but actually if that is whats necessary its going to have to happen i think that basically theres got to be a gritting of the teeth for a while and a recognition that our normal sense of a pay hierarchy is going to have to be suspended because were in a transitional period were transitioning from entrenched discrimination to equality another way to close the gap of course would be to fill the highest paid roles with women some people say the oddest things harman offers rolling her eyes like they say well we have got a pay gap but thats because all the men are at the senior levels if one consequence of the act is that employers have a tangible incentive to promote women to positions of power within organisations it will do much more than merely close the pay gap oh totally harman agrees it is kind of and she drops her voice to a stage whisper revolutionary a lifelong feminist born in harman has been a leading figure in the womens movement for as long as almost anyone can remember parliament was male when she arrived in and her first commons question to margaret thatcher concerned the lack of childcare provision during school holidays maternity leave and pay allwomen shortlists sure start centres even the abolition of the arcane provocation law which basically said it was a womans fault if her husband killed her were all down to her work for womens rights yet for decades she was mocked as harridan harperson even on her own benches the enduring mystery if not miracle is how she stuck at it as she talks at her kitchen table now she has the quiet satisfaction of sensing history on her side this pay gap information comes at a time where women are not minded any more to accept phoney explanations and justifications there is this sense now about what women are not prepared to put up with which is very like that spirit of the s and s womens movement the spirit of were not having this anymore this is wrong is abroad again the irony that this in large part is thanks to harvey weinstein is not lost on her the harvey weinstein thing is exactly the same thing as the pay gap it was like the dam burst because of a brave couple of women who spoke out and suddenly all the others said yes thats right with the pay thing its burst because theres a statutory requirement to disclosure when harman published her memoir a womans work last year which revealed that her university tutor had offered to upgrade her degree result if she slept with him the daily mail and other critics savaged the claim i was told either you made it up or you should have said it at the time or youre being mean to somebody whos dead that was just a few months before the harvey weinstein thing harman was still busy with book publicity when theresa may called last years snap election like most of her colleagues harman braced herself for the worst she thought labour would be wiped out oh the atmosphere in the plp was slightly less cheerful than a dignitas waiting room i mean everybody thought they were on their way out literally half the plp was saying goodbye to each other and hugging and now were jeremy corbyns office to call and offer her another front bench role i ask what she would say no definitely im a former theres lots of amazingly good people and they are the future many harman fans still bitterly regret her decision not to stand for the labour leadership in the same constituency is determined to see a woman succeed corbyn but when i ask if harman supports introducing a constitutional mechanism to guarantee it she spreads her hands well i might be if somebody works out a good way of doing it im totally not against it but i couldnt work one out that didnt seem to have loads of downsides but actually we need to recognise that weve got some fantastic men in the labour party new men coming forward who are rightly ambitious and we ought to really be encouraging them and admiring the great work that theyre doing and saying you will go far you will really go far you could aspire to be deputy what weve got to have is a generation of men who know that the height of their ambition is to

when people began sharing their stories of sexual harassment and assault under the hashtag metoo this past october i knew it was only a matter of time before various woke brands would seek to defang and coopt the movement in corporate sinister ways now that time has come and its as depressing as it was inevitable former actress rose mcgowan whose harrowing stories about harvey weinstein did much to get the ball rolling called attention to this on tuesday when she criticized times up a legal defense fund set up by prominent hollywood women to help workers across the country deal with sexual harassment for holding a set of events at the offices of creative artists agency caa one of hollywoods largest talent agencies who do you think is behind this great pr she tweeted why its the company of pimps that sent so many into a the monsters lair themselves caa timesup fakes as vanity fair and others have documented agencies like caa icm and others failed for years to protect their clients from a man whose predatory behavior was an open secret in hollywood the agencies deny any knowledge that this was going on mcgowan seems to think differently while their hearts are clearly in the right place the people running times up might want to think twice before aligning themselves so closely with companies hoping to buy their way out of any lingering weinsteinderived pr problems the sufficiency of times up chosen tactics charity and lawsuits are also up for debate but even wouldbe corporate allies who have not played a role in protecting harassers can be problematic bedfellows for grassroots movements as the washington post reports a number of startups are seeking to cash in on the rising demand for a harassmentfree workplace by tackling the problem in a managementfriendly way businesses like tequitable allvoices and bravely help companies as neil hooper of stopit put it get ahead of these issues before they become claims a number of these apps seek to work around peoples completely justified fear of retaliation when signing their names to reports of harassment bias or abuse but while mitigating workplace harassment is a net plus even if companies are only doing it to save money this approach carries some downsides one of the most exciting things about metoo has been the possibility that workers might channel all this bottledup rage into collective struggle against not just a few bad apples but the patriarchy writ large as well as its good friends white supremacy and capitalism to cite just one example writer and organizer alex press notes that sexual harassment was a major rallying point in her efforts to organize graduate students even the male students cared by convincing workers to deal with harassment on an individual basis these businesses suck the wind out of our sails removing a compelling fulcrum point from efforts to agitate for our rights in a collective comprehensive and effective way why address just one issue by yourself when you could address every issue with help from tons of other people thats just math for of women and gender nonbinary people sexual harassment is just one part of a whole venn diagram of oppression that can involve race gender sexuality and of course the exploitative relationship between workers and employers upon which our very economic system is built let entrepreneurs do their

this week has brought yet another reminder o america that while film stars and pop icons have matchless gifts to bestow on our collective entertainment responsible policymaking for our nationstates demands more specialised qualifications catherine deneuve is a legendary french actor an enchanting performer a great artist and a famous beauty shes also in the news on wednesday deploring the wave of denunciations that has followed claims that the hollywood producer harvey weinstein raped and sexually assaulted women yes in the context of metoo and its french equivalent balancetonporc call out your pig the actor most famous for her belle de jour role as a woman who cannot distinguish sexual fantasy from reality has stated i dont think it is the right method to change things it is excessive these things reported by women and men across the world have included acts of sexual violence abuse assault entrapment harassment coercion blackmail public sexual humiliation the accusations include louis ck masturbating in front of nonconsenting women harvey weinstein ejaculating on to a womans nightclothes after raping her things done by men who lied insulted threatened cornered touched up fingered groped squeezed and penetrated those whose power and status were less than their own as a reminder that it was as a delectable indulgence not of sex but of advantage now deneuves name is among female signatories in a letter to le monde protesting the campaigns with the spurious insistence that exposing abuse and naming abusers helps the enemies of sexual liberty they claim men have been punished merely for sending sexually charged messages to women who did not return their attentions we are cleareyed enough the group pronounces not to confuse an awkward attempt to pick someone up with a sexual attack omg ladies me too me and all the other women who have exposed the damaged tissues of the shame inflicted on us by our predators are quite cleareyed on the distinction thats why we are so angry not because we are puritanical as the letter claims but because we are seeking joy from sexual contact on our own terms not abuse or exploitation on someone elses even those of us who are not oscarnominated who will never be among a clique of writers performers and academics with the privilege to gab off in le monde can grasp this difference those of us who have been the waitresses shop assistants soldiers scientists students and anyone else who were hit on said no tried to leave did not consent clearly did not want to be there and were ignored sexual liberty is the right to determine your own sexual behaviour without coercion dare i suggest that those of us who have lived without power and status perhaps understand this with a greater keenness of experience than those who have imagine inhabiting such a world of privilege that the fantasy of superiority becomes real to you lets hope no one ever gives a person like that a position of political leadership or control of a nuclear arsenal that could get scary and its already a very scary world just ask the deneuve group who have added their voices to the claim that there is a witchhunt out to get the poor marginalised and oppressed male sexual predators of the world if ever there was a claim that could add wilful insult to an enraging situation it is this one as an historical comparison to invoke its like claiming the spanish inquisition as an oppressed class or gilles de rais was a victim of social prejudice should it really have to be stated that unlike the perpetrators exposed by metoo societys witches are never the powerful men with the property status and advantages of a social order that protects hides and excuses their crimes david m perry emphasised the point in the pacific standard this week that historically speaking witch hunts involved powerful state and religious agencies identifying then executing vulnerable people mostly women and other outsiders the ideological influence of religious institutions has been supplanted by modern media structures and the era is one in which entertainment celebrity conflated with political authority has provoked dangerously unstable realities only within the structural narcissism encouraged in hollywoods predatorbarons and those like them could being held to account for ones own behaviour provoke complaints of victimisation no less than accused child molester woody allen has claimed that the denunciation of weinstein is fostering a witch hunt atmosphere in a film industry that even yet sustains him its the likes of allen and weinstein and the other men accused again and again of abuses with whom deneuve and her friends are aligning themselves with their letter their actions are not those in defence of freedom let alone sexual expression or female identity theyre standing with those making excuses to torch powerless women not anyone defending their liberty van badham is a guardian australia

carrie gracies open letter appealing for equal pay has dramatised a fight that has already been going on for the best part of years her principled stand cannot be dismissed just because the sums involved are way beyond most peoples wildest dreams she is very well paid but her argument is about fairness she wants the bbc to stick to the law it must value men and women equally nearly years after the equal pay act it is shocking that it still needs saying the bbcs highly rated but evidently not highly valued china editor resigned because managers could not grasp that her case was not about more money but more equality having been promoted to one of the big four international editor jobs on condition that all of them jon sopel in washington jeremy bowen in beirut katya adler in brussels and carrie gracie in beijing were paid equally she was appalled when the figures for top earners published last summer included the men but not the women the discrimination could hardly appear more explicit for several months the bbc flannelled around trying to head off a row without dealing with the substance of ms gracies complaint finally after fruitless negotiations and a protracted and inconclusive grievance process she did as she had warned the bosses she would and resigned she felt the alternative to go back to beijing would be colluding with the bbcs claim of equal pay rather than continuing to challenge it the bbc claims it has a good record on the gender paygap but this is not about the unfair distribution of higherpaid jobs it is about treating people doing work of equal value the same and here the bbc is impaled on a pike it made itself with hundreds of secret individual pay deals that were never supposed to be seen by the female workforce when some of these were exposed by the publication of top earners pay the management tried to deal with the backlash by a policy of divide and rule offering some rises to as many as women who believe their pay is unfair this response was morally wrong and politically inadequate it perpetuates structural wage inequality that affects workers at every point on the pay scale from millions of low earners where the median hourly gender pay gap for fulltime work is just short of to the elite of top earners where men earn half as much again as women doing similar work the bbc is not alone by this april all companies employing more than people are due to file a report to the government setting out a breakdown of pay and bonuses by gender this is not on the face of it a very onerous obligation yet with a couple of month still to go only employers of those obliged to make the return have actually done so some of those have rewritten the data on one or more occasion there is a statistically improbable proportion of employers claiming no earnings gap at all clearly there is nothing unusual about pay secrecy but a fair society depends on a high degree of transparency and accountability and the bbc is a public service organisation with a particular obligation to stick to the letter of the law yet this is also a fight for every woman ms gracies brave and principled stand of a piece with her record

carrie gracie is brilliantly knowledgeable about china and its affairs the fraught and complex field that she has explained and interpreted for the benefit of the rest of us for most of her professional life she also has a reputation as a generous and supportive colleague it is because of both those invaluable qualities that she has resigned from her job as china editor because her employers will not pay her at the same rate as they pay the handful of men who do a similarly challenging and important job she has resigned because she refused to go on colluding as she put it in an interview with bbc womans hour with the bbcs dishonesty about its failure to give women and men equal pay for equal work collusion is a powerful word with an unpleasant echo of bad people working together for bad ends it is precisely the technique that managements all over the world use to exploit women gracie was recruited to the job and recruited is the word they sought her out because she had all the talent and skills the bbc needed to cover the huge difficult international and domestic story of the rise of china one of the conditions she set for taking it was equal pay with the corporations other international editors familiar names including jon sopel in washington and jeremy bowen in the middle east last summer the government forced the bbc to publish which of the familiar names on radio and tv earned over the results exposed an astonishing pay gap they also showed gracie that her employers had misled her she was not being paid equally with men doing a similar job in the open letter she published on sunday night gracie sets out all her efforts to get her bosses to do what they had originally promised her the lengths she went to and their failure to respond adequately instead they prevaricate and procrastinate offer her a pay rise that still would not have delivered parity and repeatedly fail to believe her warnings that she would resign if they did not treat her complaint seriously they treated her it seems to me the way they would treat a man they thought they could buy her off they behaved as if they were two sides in the familiar old dance routine the negotiation for a bigger pay cheque they thought that the reputational hazard she was running and make no mistake she does risk her reputation however wrong that is would scare her away from the fight but gracie could not have been more explicit that it was not about the level of her pay she thinks top pay at the bbc is too high no wonder the bosses find her hard to deal with it was about the principle the one about which the corporation chunters on in such a selfcongratulatory way equality except the bbc repeatedly confuses equal pay a jobspecific definition with the gender pay gap the difference between pay in any given group of workers which is entirely irrelevant to gracies case gracie as the bbc ought to realise but doesnt is doing them the service of treating them with just the kind of integrity and forensic reporting skills that she brings to her journalism she is hunting down the facts setting them in the legal context reviewing the application of the law in employment tribunals and shining a laser beam of light into the murky and secretive world of bbc pay policy she is doing it because she is a very very good journalist but she is also doing it because she believes in solidarity she thinks that as a leader she owes it to the younger women with whom she works she thinks that as the employee of a public broadcaster that she believes is a great organisation it is her responsibility to stop it doing something stupid and wasteful which is among other things what resisting the or so equal pay claims that are being levelled against it would amount to in a situation that ought to be but i hope isnt beyond parody gracie herself was presenting the bbc today programme on radio simultaneously the subject and the object of one of the biggest stories of the day with oprah winfreys overnight speech at the golden globes casting an extra depth of meaning on gracies struggle her calm articulate words should have left the entire upper echelons of the corporation banging their heads on their desks at what they have managed to achieve in her only comments on the today programme gracie said she hoped she wouldnt be remembered as the woman who

iceland started with a bold statement the nordic country made it illegal to pay women less than men for similar work the first thought that popped into my head on hearing the news was bravo the second thought was how soon can we get this rolled out in australia how soon can businesses here be forced to prove they value the labour of both genders equally when will they face the financial and moral consequences if they dont and believe me too many of them dont the workplace gender equality agency wgea reports that men still outearn women by more than on average with pay gaps in every industry and occupation while the overall gender pay gap is steadily closing and i along with many of my fellow leaders in the diversity and inclusion space herald this narrowing disparity i am impatient for speedier more significant change the pace of progress is just too slow and theres simply too much at stake to sit back and watch this number tick down over our lifetimes pay inequality can have a devastating impact on women as they progress through their careers and the lifetime earnings deficit that accumulates while we wait around for our workforce to move fully in the right direction could leave too many of them in poverty that said i recognise that the drivers of the gender pay gap are deeply complex and also that the government is taking action to address some of them in july turnbull and team launched towards an australian government strategy to boost womens workforce participation one of this programs key objectives is to drive childcare and early learning reforms which in turn would encourage to families and women in particular to increase their workforce participation thats a start given that dcas report shes pricedless the economics of the gender pay gap produced in conjunction with kpmg and wgea showed that years out of the workforce due to caring responsibilities is one of two key factors driving the pay gap but our research also showed that the single largest factor contributing to the gender pay gap is sex discrimination and thats inclusive of direct discrimination as well as indirect factors such as unconscious bias unconscious bias thrives in a climate where many still doubt the mere existence of the pay gap or the voracity of annual statistics which time and again highlight the pay gaps stubborn legacy in our society some of the fictions i often hear include things such as women would choose to work parttime given that the census once again showed that women do the bulk of unpaid caring roles in families and given that men are paid more than women it isnt really a choice but a financial necessity for the higher wage earner to be in fulltime work another fiction is that women choose lower paying jobs when research shows that when women move into an industry in larger numbers their work is devalued and everyone is paid less another study shows that the higher the percentage of women in an industry the lower its perceived prestige raising awareness of these kinds of myths and unconscious bias is key to overcoming the gender pay gap we must also develop a national action plan and report regularly on the targets while many organisations already do this perhaps its time to take icelands lead and introduce consequences for failing to recognise and act on one of the most stubborn problems in the australian workforce the jury is still out as to how this will play out in iceland but in the meantime its something worth considering in australia lisa annese is chief executive officer for the diversity council

more than years ago helen garner wrote a book about sexual harassment at the university of melbourne the ormond college case as it became known to call the first stone a controversial book is doing it an injustice it was savage and whiny and journalistically flawed and it was in garners style full of selfdoubt it tossed and turned about what was bubbling beneath this campus incident what it had to say about women men sex and power the daily papers were awash with endless outrages against women as if victimhood were the sum of our experience she wrote long before social media gave us the power to ignore or shape the daily papers agenda and long before identity politics became so fraught over the past few months every woman and man i know of all ages and backgrounds have been talking about sexual harassment and what bubbles beneath it these have been deep and challenging conversations with far more honesty than those in when the first stone was published yet this was the case and this was the book that opened up the conversation in australia much as anita hills testimony accusing supreme court nominee clarence thomas of sexual harassment did in the united states revisiting the first stone at this convulsive moment is to be irritated all over again to feel how dated it is how much the currents have shifted it is to be confronted too with garners uncomfortable truths her questions that remain not just relevant but crucial if we are to navigate what so many of us hope to be a permanent cultural leap with grace as well as vengeance i know its not quite the time for it this is still the bombthrowing stage the rage stage change is hard we need warriors who will brook no selfdoubt to get it done but we also need our garners our worriers unafraid to be accused of treachery to the cause the book on one level is innocent compared with the astonishing tumble of powerful and monstrous men in the united states and the nascent widening of the discussion beyond individuals to structures to culture after decades of silence of open secrets in plain sight women feel the power of looking out for each other of being heard and believed one friend told me that for the first time she felt people had her back on one day she had been harassed mildly but annoyingly twice why should she have to put up with that for the first time in my life there is an almost scary sense that actually we shouldnt have to navigate that as the price of being female that this moment could signal a change in the way we behave towards one another the beginning of the end of patriarchy in the west could that even be possible in australia accusations against former gardening guru don burke were almost unbelievable the lord mayor of melbourne robert doyle a respected former victorian leader of the liberal party is on leave following claims by a fellow councillor that he harassed her including grabbing her breast doyle has denied wrongdoing now several women have accused actor craig mclachlan of harassment and indecent assault he also denies the allegations we are at the beginning of all this there will be many more revelations and accusations some amounting to serious sexual assault others clumsy lechery the first stone was about one relatively minor incident it dealt with an ormond college endofyear dinner at the university of melbourne in october after which two students claimed that the residential college master alan gregory had groped them one woman said he twice squeezed her breast during a slow dance and the other that he invited her into his office said he had indecent thoughts about her and grabbed her breasts the master said none of this happened garner was jolted when she read a desolate little item in the age about gregory being up on an indecent assault charge in the magistrates court over the dance incident she put her reflexive reaction in a letter to gregory that as a lifelong feminist it was heartbreaking to see feminist ideals distorted into this ghastly punitiveness the most appallingly destructive priggish and pitiless way of dealing with it why did the women go to the police why was the punishment of the master who was eventually cleared by the courts but forced out of the university so out of proportion to his crime garner frets away at those questions telling of her own experiences of unwanted sexual attention and railing against puritan feminists consumed by rage and fear the womens supporters loathed her for it and many still do when garner wrote her book sexual harassment had only been nationally unlawful since more than years on it remains poorly understood with a definition too broad encompassing everything from leering to sexist jokes to crimes such as stalking to sexual assault inevitably particularly in minor cases the way people react is subjective but to look at the bare facts of the first stone now huh there is no way the head of a residential university college should keep his job if he did what was alleged sorry youre a leader you set the tone and to grab a students breasts even after a few drinks is going to get you into trouble there are messy grey areas but this is not one of them then the women did not garner great public sympathy there was no metoo to share stories about how prevalent this was and how often it became persistent and debilitating to speak out was dangerous now my guess is that most people would be sympathetic to the women not only privately but publicly social media for good and bad has changed everything the treatment of the women in court and even by garner who whinges that they will not speak to her as if somehow they had an obligation to do so is shocking to read now yet the assumptions persist about how women dress how they flirt and why they stay silent heres how garner describes the qc questioning one young woman in court you were wearing said the qc consulting his notes a black tight short skirt with a lowcut top woman with straps qc otherwise no covering said the qc smoothly and heres the punchline so recognisable now qc the first time the master squeezed your breast you didnt move away from him woman i didnt want to believe that someone in that position would have done that qc why didnt you slap im garner almost gasps you bastard i thought every woman in the room could answer that question in hindsight the story of the first stone is really about how the university dealt with the complaints way back in and the women would not have gone to the police i agree with garner that it was a disproportionate response if the university had processes in place to handle it if they had taken it seriously it failed and acknowledged that failure its oldboys inquiry moving too slowly and coming up with a nonanswer it determined that the womens complaints were made in good faith but declared full confidence in the master garner understood what the women felt what women have felt forever it was as though they hadnt been heard only as the months dragged on and the publicity did its damage did the university lose confidence in the master tossing him aside universities have put enormous effort into responding better to sexual harassment and assault particularly after the human rights commissions report last year found of respondents had been sexually harassed in the past two years putting more resources and energy into dealing with complaints is selfevidently a good thing particularly in serious cases yet to channel garner we have to get serious about where the problems really lie if we are not to go down the alarming path of the campuses in the us where due process has been abandoned by too many universities even in allegations of serious sexual assault the culture wars may have been tedious in the early s they are killing reasoned debate and finding solutions now the commissions report was worthwhile but flawed in its methodology and its conclusions and it is not letting the side down for progressives to say so it was a voluntary survey its response rate low the included harassment on or off campus just over a quarter happened on campus and half of those were staring or offensive comments with no clarity on how serious or persistent these transgressions were the most common location for sexual harassment was not on campus but on public transport travelling to or from university just at this hopeful moment we have a parallel force that risks taking women backwards a puritanism that places victimhood as central to female experience it was there when garner wrote the first stone it is soaring now insisting its purpose is to empower women garner spoke to an academic who wanted to forbid staffstudent relationships isnt this a bit bloody islamic garner asks could a student and a teacher go to the movies have a coffee hold hands wheres the line to be drawn garner and the academic laugh together without convincing each other the rules are getting tighter the complexities lost as a university student garner had an affair with an older tutor it ended badly but she never thought of it as sexual harassment or as an abuse of power but a relatively minor thing part of my stores of experience today theres a push to not just discourage relationships between staff and students and to watch out for conflicts of interest but to ban them they are a massive abuse of power according to some instead of messy consensual relationships do women who fought so hard for sexual freedom with all its attendant risks really need protecting from men to this extent in all cases garner is aware of the immense weight of men on women the ubiquity of their attentions the exhaustion of our resistance but through the book there is no sense that that could change it just couldnt be comprehended at the time it is hard to overstate what a mind shift that has been over the past few months what an explosion of insight and possibility for this moment is not really about sexual harassment it is about the unfinished project of equality between men and women that has much more to do with disadvantaged women with casual jobs than hollywood stars with all their privileges but most women from all classes all backgrounds recognise that weight yet garner wont let women off the hook not for a moment she reminds us that feminism is about justice unjust is the word for the behaviour of men who use their position of power as a weapon in forcing women to endure their repeated sexual approaches or who take revenge for a knockback by distorting a womans career or making her workplace intolerable or sacking her unjust does not apply to a clumsy pass at a party by a man whos had too much to drink these days it does and mostly should if that man is a leader in an organisation but her point about proportion about gradation of offence rings true today the hardline view that every transgression reinforces rape culture and misogyny is a hindrance not a help the ability to discriminate must be maintained writes garner otherwise all we are doing is increasing the injustice of the world so when a teen vogue writer says that she is not at all concerned about innocent men losing their jobs over false sexual assaultharassment allegations if some innocent mens reputations have to take a hit in the process of undoing the patriarchy that is a price i am absolutely willing to pay she is dead wrong the daily telegraphs overthetop frontpage coverage of an anonymous complaint against actor geoffrey rush with no detail of what the complaint was was dead wrong a common reaction to actor matt damons unremarkable statements that theres a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation and that both of those behaviours need to be confronted and eradicated without question but they shouldnt be conflated was that he should shut up because hes a man theres even a petition to have his scenes in an upcoming movie snipped out thats dead wrong too and risks a backlash of our own making one of the best things to come out of this is that men are grappling with these issues seriously many for the first time we are beyond garners the first stone there is clarity about the pervasiveness of sexual harassment the damage it causes and what lies beneath it yet as an article in the new yorker noted in it still seems a brilliantly prescient book in its complexity in the tense torque of its selfargument and in its very vulnerability and stunned intolerance garners book had a subtitle some questions about sex

more big companies have been found to have wide gender pay gaps as firms report on what they pay male and female employees ahead of an april deadline the cooperative bank easyjet and virgin money are among those with a doubledigit gap in their mean hourly pay rates between male and female workers both private and public sector organisations as well as charities with more than employees are required to submit their pay figures to the government by april the move is intended to highlight the worst instances and encourage employers to address the situation the gender pay gap refers to the difference between what men and women working for an organisation earn regardless of their roles rather than men and women being paid different amounts for the same role one of the widest pay gaps has been reported by easyjet the discrepancy is largely accounted for by the fact that most of the airlines pilots are male the average salary for such a role is more than more than twothirds of easyjet

on october the women of iceland refused to show up for work they refused to cook clean or look after their children basically they went on strike and that day the shops in iceland ran out of the only convenience food available at the time sausages call it symbolism but by going on strike the women of iceland were calling for men to respect their work and demanding equal pay this week iceland became the first country in the world to make companies prove they are not paying women less than men for the same work employers are rushing to comply with the new rules to avoid fines companies and government agencies with more than staff must obtain government certification of their equal pay policies iceland has long been deemed the best place in the world to be a woman for the past nine years the country has topped the world economic forums gender equality index the uk comes in at th in iceland men get at least three months paternity leave and of them take it this gives them time to become comfortable with childrearing encouraging them to share the workload with their partners women in iceland are highly educated a high percentage hold managerial positions and they dont give up their careers to have children they do both like the countrys new prime minister at the end of iceland got its second female prime minister a yearold with three young sons many in iceland see the womens strike of as a defining moment in the gender equality struggle on the womens day off as its known of women stopped work and refused to do any household chores schools and nurseries were closed many shops factories and theatres had to close their doors fathers were left with no choice but to bring their kids to work stocking up on sweets and colouring pencils to keep them occupied on the radio children could be heard playing in the background while the newsreaders read the news after work the children needed to be fed and the whole thing ended up as the day the men of iceland ran out of sausages i am the daughter of a woman called vigds finnbogadttir not literally shes not my biological mother and ive never even met her in the summer of vigds a divorced single mother became one of the first women in the world to be democratically elected as a head of state i was not yet two years old when she became the president of iceland and at the same time europes first female president it turned out to be an election result that shaped a generation of icelandic women vigds we go by our first names even the president was a popular president she held the position for years seeing a woman in a position of power had a profound effect on me and my female contemporaries when we were growing up surprisingly however it wasnt the uniqueness of a woman being president that shaped our worldview but the mundanity of it we werent looking at her and thinking yes theres our proof women can be leaders we were just looking at her thinking that she was the norm to us a woman being president was nothing out of the ordinary vigds now in her late s places much importance on the womens strike in and insists that she would not have been elected president if it hadnt been for that symbolic act what happened that day was the first step for womens emancipation in iceland she told the bbc in it completely paralysed the country and opened the eyes of many men but my generations future didnt exactly turn out to be the promised land of equality that we thought awaited us not a single woman has served as president of iceland since vigds after a general election in the percentage of women in parliament dropped by almost from to and recently we have not moved the needle significantly on the gender pay gap which has remained stubbornly at around for years yes iceland is the best place in the world to be a woman but there is still room for improvement when it comes to the fight for equality symbolic acts such as the womens day off can achieve great things but sometimes more drastic measures are needed according to the wefs latest predictions women will have to wait years for the gender pay gap to close the daughters of vigds the girls who grew up in iceland in the s and s are now grown up and raising daughters of their own they do not want to wait that long and they certainly do not want their daughters to have to fight the same fight their mothers and grandmothers fought before them maybe thanks to icelands new law the vision of equal pay for men and women can finally be achieved in the uk marks years since some women were granted the right to vote the celebrations will be largely symbolic acts an allfemale cast is appearing on this years celebrity big brother the royal mint is making a new p coin to mark the occasion but perhaps

a badly designed and painfully clunky page hidden away on the government equalities office website is beginning to grab the attention of women all over the country if you work for a company that employs more than people and you havent looked at the site yet set aside some time and prepare for your eyeballs to spring from their sockets the governments gender pay gap reporting website opens up for scrutiny the hidden power dynamics inside all midsized to large organisations revealing pay differences between male and female staff and the proportion of women in the best and the worstpaid roles with a month to go before the deadline for reporting the site is already having an explosive impact on how women view their employers last week a female senior manager at barclays investment bank in london opened the site searched for her own company and discovered that womens median hourly rate is lower than male colleagues and that womens bonuses are lower it was an unpleasant sensation confirming in black and white something that she had long suspected perhaps most revealingly the website also divides organisations into four groups according to the amount staff are paid the bestpaid quartile the second best the third best and the worst quartile at barclays of the bestpaid employees are men of the worst paid are women sadly i wasnt shocked the woman who has asked not to be named says at she is paid very well but is conscious of younger male colleagues advancing faster through the ranks the pay gap data has crystallised her desire to quit junior women are feeling very dispirited and upset the figures made me feel that this organisation isnt the right place for me that it wont let me achieve my potential the concept of extreme pay disparities in city finance is not particularly new but what is arresting about the site is the way it offers an xray of the inner workings of diverse organisations from universities to meatpacking businesses government departments to highstreet fashion retailers sewage companies to the ritz it is no surprise to see that men are better paid across the board and dominate the upper reaches of the pay scale but the detail of how much more they are getting and how comprehensively they have seized the best jobs is addictively fascinating companies are stripped naked by the process and attitudes towards women are revealed with uncomfortable clarity over the next month a massively important chapter in the struggle for equal pay will be unfolding in real time remember the noise made by the bbcs disclosures last summer and multiply that by for an idea of the scale of what is happening aware presumably of the incendiary nature of the data organisations are in no hurry to report eleven months since the exercise launched only of the or so companies that need to file have done so the remaining will need to report in the next month many are holding on in the hope that scrutiny of their pay decisions will be less intense if they participate in a lastminute data dump the disparities in some of the most highprofile companies have already been well aired the hourly rate for women at easyjet is lower that of their male colleagues and of the bestpaid staff are men while of the worstpaid are women these differences have been shrugged off as simply reflecting the fact that cabin crew tend to be women and pilots tend to be men as if that makes everything ok at the travel group tui airways previously known as thomson airways there is a similar picture with men paid more than double women and where of the bestpaid employees are men while of the worstpaid are women but pluck almost any organisation at random and there is a similar picture at abingdon flooring on an industrial estate near newport of the bestpaid employees are men at rowe farming in doddington of the bestpaid staff are men at north east derbyshire council of the bestpaid quartile of staff are men at the dorchester hotel womens median bonus pay is lower than mens part of the point of the reporting exercise is to trigger a debate about how men and women are paid there are no sanctions for having a big gap the idea is that companies will be forced to examine their record and improve a surprising number of organisations however seem puzzled about why the figures arouse any interest at all the bigger slicker companies have invested a lot of money in creating videos and explainers designed to reassure female staff that they are not being discriminated against the main points seem to be one there are simply more men in senior roles as if that is most natural thing in the world and requires no explanation and two the companies are not doing anything illegal the videos offer calm explanations of the difference between unequal pay which is illegal and the pay gap which simply reflects how women are working in different ways in different parts of the companies and are paid differently ie usually less as a result the less enlightened companies say oh well its a social issue says ann francke the chief executive of the chartered management institute which has been monitoring this issue for more than a decade lets not blame society there is a glass pyramid in many organisations many more women are getting better grades good degrees getting hired into junior positions before slipping away its not just a motherhood penalty we have to mentor and sponsor talented women and pull them into the upper ranks she believes the process is already forcing constructive conversations when weve talked about the pay gap before the response has always been that must be happening somewhere else it couldnt possibly be in my organisation as more and more companies are forced to confront their own data they realise oh my goodness it is me because we made progress and got more women on boards a lot of ceos thought tick weve done gender but of course they havent even begun to do gender there has been discussion of implementing an ethnicity pay gap on a similar model but the government is still reviewing the feasibility of this and it looks a way off in the meantime many organisations feel they have done enough simply by publishing laudable diversity objectives the information required by the government on gender is basic it gives no insight into how race and class feed into pay differences and is not detailed enough to allow people to look at how their pay compares with that of the people sitting next to them the metrics are crude but the conversations they are promoting are very helpful it displays the structure of a workforce in a way that we could never have seen otherwise says vanessa pine who as special adviser to the lib dems jo swinson and vince cable during the last years of the coalition helped push backroom negotiations that forced david cameron to enact this line of the equality act requiring this information to be published a whole industry is rapidly developing around managing the message to staff once the data emerges pine has set up a company atlas partners which among other things advises organisations on the importance of explaining to female employees why the gap is there and setting out what they are doing about it there will be an emotional impact on staff and organisations have to anticipate what the backlash from both male and female employees is going to be handled badly it could make women feel disaffected make them want to leave increase whistleblowing or corporate espionage because theyll be thinking well fuck that she says if you are outside the building some of the justifications make hilarious reading giving context to the revelation that womens bonus pay at whitbread is lower than mens the hospitality company declares with typically cheerful corporate gloss we believe in giving people the chance to shine it adds without any apparent need for regret or explanation that the bonus gap simply reflects the weighting of more males in the senior leader bonus schemes the ceo of the ritz which turns out to be heavily staffed by men all the way up the pay scale and where of the bestpaid people are men asserts that the results womens hourly rate lower are extremely positive which i am delighted about in an inhouse video with tranquil piano music tinkling in the background white male executives from boston consultancy group where womens hourly rate is lower than mens promise that integrity diversity and respect for the individual are part of our core values gender diversity is a top priority we are highly committed etc etc explaining that the pay gap is not illegal the company states we have fewer women in senior roles the fashion company phase eight where the median hourly rate for women is lower than the rate for men and bonuses for women are lower ties itself in knots trying to justify the anomaly the real reason for it is that the company has very few male employees but almost all of those it does have are at the top of the business of directors are men the company can say we have a positive commitment to diversity and inclusion until it is blue in the face but it remains an organisation led by a wellpaid male ceo and staffed by a lot of less wellpaid women internally these justificatory presentations can be as upsetting as the figures themselves the senior barclays manager says we have a diversity and inclusion team headed by a man who says we dont have an issue with gender it starts right at the beginning i watch male colleagues with five years less experience being primed for promotion i think i was brought in one pay level below where i should have been the way in which we interpret talent is different a young man who can string a sentence together is recognised as a future leader an older woman with more experience is often ignored a halifax banking consultant helping customers open bank accounts at a highstreet branch said the news that women employed by lloyds the parent company receive lower bonuses than men and that the hourly rate was lower for women made her blood boil she is paid after years in her post and is now considering looking for new work it clarified a lot of things for me she said its disgusting but im not that surprised there was a round of management vacancies recently and the bulk of them went to younger male employees now i think i wont get promoted im way beyond anger ive been through anger and being depressed i just feel disappointed she got a pay rise last year equating to before tax and an annual bonus of she has been told that she could be disciplined if she talks about money with colleagues so she doesnt know how her bonus compares with those of male colleagues but she has her suspicions whether you get along with your line manager influences the size of the bonus and theyre all men she said sam smethers the chief executive of the gender equality campaigning charity the fawcett society said she found the revelations around bonuses particularly powerful its hard to argue that a or bonus pay gap is justifiable that wont be driven by performance alone it will be asked for women are not or less productive than men when women ask for bonuses they are seen as pushy a small handful of organisations have come out looking not too bad but these tend to be bodies such as westminster abbey and the british museum where the median wage for women is slightly higher where you imagine top pay doesnt reach hedge fund levels the pay gap at the guardian is expected to be released on to the site in midmarch there is some cynicism about the likelihood of the findings triggering change a female employee with years experience at a bank that has reported a huge pay gap who like all the women quoted here did not feel able to speak on the record about pay and company culture without getting into trouble at work and who was so worried about being identified that she also asked for the banks name to not be published said she was paid and had no way of knowing how that compared with male colleagues she understood that the gap wasnt about women being paid less for equal work but was because of a glass ceiling at middlemanagement level women take time off to have children and they never catch up in terms of career progression then they take time out to look after elderly dependents there is inherent sexism in how thats dealt with we try to get change but men are holding the levers of power were expecting our oppressors to change the system its like asking turkeys to vote for christmas,2018-02,badly

they pay both male and female staff the same the median is the figure that falls in the middle of a range when everyones wages are lined up from smallest to largest the median is a typically a more representative figure as the mean can be skewed by a handful of highly paid employees the reasons for the disparity in pay vary from company to company but the broader source of the gap can be seen in the distribution of high earners by gender of all the companies that have reported to date the top pay quartile the highest paid of employees is maledominated almost twothirds of the top quartile is

what is gender pay gap reporting and what is being published all companies in great britain but not northern ireland with more than employees are reporting their gender pay gap to the government equalities office geo all public bodies are due to report by march and all companies are due to report by april companies will also publish details of the proportion of men and women in the company who receive bonuses and the breakdown of men and women in different pay quartiles what is the gender pay gap the gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly earnings of men and women about companies and public bodies will report the difference in both mean and median hourly earnings and bonus payments the figure is expressed as a proportion of mens earnings according to the ons the gap between what uk male and female workers earn based on median hourly earnings for fulltime workers fell to in april last year from a year earlier it was in when the ons first collected the data the mean gender pay gap is and has been stuck at the same level for three years when all workers full and parttime are included the gap increases to for median earnings and for mean earnings parttime workers are included in the reporting of the gender pay gap so this is the national equivalent figure whats the difference between the mean and the median figures the mean commonly known as the average is calculated when you add up the wages of all employees and divide the figure by the number of employees the mean gender pay gap is the difference between mean male pay and mean female pay for example if the hourly gender pay gap at a company is then for every earned by a man a woman would earn the median is the figure that falls in the middle of a range when everyones wages are lined up from smallest to largest the median gap is the difference between the employee in the middle of the range of male wages and the middle employee in the range of female wages the median is a typically a more representative figure as the mean can be skewed by a handful of highly paid employees a large difference between the mean and the median can be indicative of inequality at either end of the pay spectrum however usually the inequality is most marked at the top end of the pay scale does the method of calculation affect the figures yes the way the gender pay gap is calculated does affect how the gap is represented as the gender pay gap is reported as a proportion of mens earnings it can appear to minimise the gap from a female employees perspective for example where the pay gap is this means that mens pay is double that of their female coworkers is the data reliable the figures are reported to the geo but it is up to the individual companies and public bodies to calculate their own gender pay gaps the data does not appear to be factchecked and a number of companies have restated their figures to date does it mean women are being paid less than men in the same roles they may be but the data gathered by the geo does not tell us this the data gathered is a relatively blunt tool and only tells us the overall gender gap as well as the bonus pay gap and the proportion of men and women in each quartile of the pay structure of the company isnt it illegal to pay women less than men yes and it has been for years under the equal pay act and more recently the equality act it is against the law to pay people performing the same role or work of equivalent value differently because of their gender this applies to all employers regardless of size what will happen if companies dont report the equality and human rights commission ehrc is responsible for ensuring employers publish their gender pay gap the ehrc says it will approach employers informally at first if they have not published by the deadline of april but businesses could ultimately face unlimited fines and convictions will companies be forced to close the gender pay gap there are no plans to punish companies that have a wide gender pay gap but the government has stated that it will publish sectorspecific league tables highlighting companies failing to address pay differences between men and women greater pressure may come from companies own employees and scrutiny from competitors and in the media,2018-02,gender pay gap reporting published company great britain northern ireland employee

the government has been urged to prevent domestic abusers from being permitted to crossexamine their victims in family courts the home secretary amber rudd unveiled a raft of proposals on monday relating to the treatment of domestic abuse survivors in court including making them automatically eligible for special measures such as giving evidence behind screens the charity womens aid welcomed the plans but said domestic abuse survivors were still being subjected to the abhorrent practice of being interrogated by their abusers in family courts the prisons and courts bill proposed to ban the practice but it was scrapped when theresa may called a general election rudds proposals will form part of a consultation on what to include in a forthcoming domestic abuse bill katie ghose the chief executive of womens aid said we know that the crossexamination of victims in the family courts by their abusive former partner is far too common the ministry of justice committed to ban perpetrators of domestic abuse from crossexamining victims in the family court however the legislation set out within the prisons and courts bill last year fell through due to the general election it is a matter of urgency that the government prioritises the implementation of the ban on this abhorrent practice be it through the courts bill or the domestic violence and abuse bill survivors must be able to safely access justice in both the criminal and family courts in their escape from domestic abuse the home office has proposed giving domestic abuse survivors a similar status to victims of modern slavery and sexual offences the consultation is expected to open in march writing in the times on monday rudd said it the consultation will ask how we can improve our response in the home in the community in the courtroom through to public services accommodation for women fleeing their abuser as well as how we can strengthen our laws to stop perpetrators and when possible rehabilitate them we want to remove one of the barriers that victims encounter in court coming face to face with their alleged abuser the impact of the bill risks being overshadowed by the crisis faced by womens refuges amid a major funding overhaul proposed by the ministry of housing communities and local government it plans to remove refuges and other forms of shortterm supported housing from the welfare system this would mean vulnerable women fleeing abusive partners not being able to pay for their accommodation using housing benefit the final guaranteed source of income available to refuges on average

zelda daprano was an unstoppable force and if you didnt like it you best got out of the way its through my work as a director of the victorian womens trust that i got to know zelda and she has been a personal hero of mine ever since i feel lucky for every conversation we had together each time i walked away feeling like i could do anything and she utilised those powers very skilfully she told me to ask for more from the world even if i wanted the sun so to honour my friend ill have your moon too thanks zelda daprano passed away on wednesday at the age of a staunch feminist labour unionist and pay justice advocate zelda had a profound and everlasting impact on the womens movement and labour movements within australia she also took the time in her later years to mentor and nurture young feminists i and many others are beneficiaries of that kindness and we find ourselves grieving an immense loss she left school at to join the workforce and it was in this factory work she began to witness firsthand the inequity between male and female workers with each job she took she would point out the injustice of this disparity to her employers and would be swiftly sacked she didnt care about personal consequences she cared about fairness in fed up with the lack of progress for women zelda secured herself to the doors of the commonwealth building to protest the dismissal in the arbitration court of the equal pay case of which she was a test case with the australasian meat industry employees union amieu in an alltoofamiliar pattern for this outspokenness she was fired from the amieu women werent allowed to drink in pubs just in the ladies lounges so she held pub crawls and invited all her friends women were only making c to the dollar so she only paid of her tram fare i remember suggesting on one of my visits that she was the head of the aint havin it union and she laughed the legislation zelda fought for has been all but eroded the equal pay act of has been aggressively watered down to become the fair work act and no longer even mentions pay equity gender discrimination or equal pay we allowed ourselves to be the frogs in the hot water zelda noticed and im heartbroken she couldnt stay long enough to see us fix it but fix it we will when zelda was chained to the doors of parliament a police officer foolishly underestimating her commitment began to chastise her arent you embarrassed its just you on your own he said without hesitating she replied no because soon there will be three then there will be five and then there will be she was right ten days after her protest she was joined by alva geikie and thelma solomon from that action the three women founded the womens action committee and the womens liberation centre from which the womens liberation movement in melbourne was born this changed the landscape of feminist organising in australia forever in her biography zelda described wanting to get more women involved in activism because we had passed the stage of caring about a ladylike image because women had for too long been polite and were still being ignored she didnt care about what people thought of her she cared about fairness the womens action committee organised the very first prochoice rally in with an impressive turnout of over women it was reported by the media as a horde of angry barefoot women taking to the streets zelda assured me they were definitely wearing shoes she really did walk the walk throughout her entire life as she outlived many of her friends and comrades in her later years she described herself as lacking good conversation with fellow lefties and unionists someone from the trades halls womens team would come every month to talk shop and it was a highlight for everyone involved in the victorian trades hall council introduced the zelda daprano award for union activism in a bittersweet coincidence the nominations for the award opened on the very day she passed away the flag at trades hall was lowered to half mast in her honour the legacy of zelda daprano cannot be contained within memorial writings or obituaries and it cannot die it lives within the hearts of feminists young and old who inspired by her spirit will continue to fight for equality and fairness it lives in the fire in our bellies it lives in the smirk we wear when we are doubted even through the heartache of loss

perpetrators of domestic abuse are more likely to be sent to prison even if they inflict emotional or psychological rather than physical harm alone under new guidelines being published by the sentencing council existing rules recommend that convicted offenders whose actions result in serious violence will warrant a custodial sentence in the majority of cases the fresh advice for judges released on thursday extends that principle to include cases where the emotionalpsychological harm caused is severe the sentencing council for england and wales promotes greater consistency in sentencing across the courts by issuing and updating guidelines for judges while aiming to increase public understanding of the decision judges make its new guidelines also say that domestic violence and threats should be subject to greater punishments than if the offence occurred outside of a relationship the domestic context makes the offending more serious because it represents a violation of the trust and security that normally exists between people in an intimate or family relationship the sixpage document states it also suggests that pleas for clemency by the victim should generally be disregarded because there is a risk these may have been induced by threats or volunteered through fear domestic abuse comes in many forms such as harassment assault and sex offences said jill gramann a magistrate and member of the sentencing council the increasing use of technology in offending has meant that it has also evolved in its scope and impact the guideline also emphasises that abuse can take place in a wide range of domestic settings and relationships and that abuse can be psychological sexual financial or emotional as well as physical there is no specific crime of domestic abuse but it can be a feature of many offences and the new guidelines cover a wide variety of crimes including socalled honour killings female genital mutilation and forced marriage abuse is not limited to

single parents are increasingly being pushed into precarious zerohours contracts and unsuitable selfemployment putting more children at risk of living in poverty a charity has warned in a report to mark its th anniversary the single parents charity gingerbread said there had been a increase in the number of selfemployed single parents in the past years but warned that a significant number of parents reported being pushed into unsuitable selfemployment by jobcentre advisers in an attempt to get them into work single parents are being pushed into selfemployment either by jobcentres or as a way to secure insecure work we are seeing people increasingly self employed as contractors in retail catering caring this is not an entrepreneurial choice its a last resort said dalia bengalim gingerbreads head of policy the impact is pretty obvious it cannot be right that in almost half of children from single parent families are living in poverty according to the report one in parents were forced to resort to last resort steps such as using payday lenders loan sharks and foodbanks according to the report a quarter of families are headed by a single parent twothirds of single parents are in work but of children in single parent households are living in relative poverty that is down from years ago but the figure has been increasing for the past two years and will reach by the charity said it used to be the case that work did pay it was the route out of poverty but in the modern labour market that is no longer the case bengalim said the calls made to the charitys helpline were becoming increasingly distraught we are finding that people are ringing up in more desperate situations and they have often already been to the support services we would usually signpost she said there are fewer places they can go and the situation particularly around housing and universal credit is becoming more dire the charity is calling on the government to suspend the requirement to be jobseeking for single parents with preschoolaged children or those in training to widen access to free childcare for threeyearolds to single parents in education and zerohours contracts provide jobcentre support tailored to single parents and work with employers to create genuinely familyfriendly jobs its not right that we still live in a society where children of single parents face twice the risk of poverty compared with those from couple families said gingerbreads chief executive rosie ferguson we want to see single parents valued and given the same opportunities as any other family ferguson said the unreliability of modern employment leaves single parents unsure about how much they should earn or how much childcare they need and affects their ability to access government childcare schemes that require recipients to work at least hours a week at minimum wage some parents particularly those with children under two were spending more than half their income on childcare she said single parent households have been the worst hit by the welfare reforms of the coalition government and will continue to be under changes with single parent families expected to lose of their income over annually by according to the report until single parents were not required to work until their youngest child turned but now must actively look for work or face penalties the report cites the case of a widowed single father who gave up work to look after his three schoolage children and has been unable to find a job that fits with his caring responsibilities as a result of the benefit cap there is a shortfall in their rent of each week its a pretty harsh punishment said bengalim,2018-02,single parent increasingly pushed precarious zerohours contract unsuitable selfemployment

not many people would choose to spend their sunday evening risking arrest to jump on to the red carpet at the baftas but then again not many people recognise the desperate state of domestic violence in the uk sisters uncut was founded three and a half years ago in protest against conservative austerity measures that have cut and closed lifesaving domestic violence support services across the country as domestic violence support workers and survivors weve seen firsthand how this brutal removal of specialist support has left survivors trapped in danger since then the situation has only got worse and we have campaigned relentlessly to push the government to take state responsibility for keeping survivors safe without our continued pressure over the past three years there probably wouldnt even be a domestic violence and abuse bill on the table right now but were not celebrating this piece of legislation is a dangerous distraction instead of refinancing refuges reinstating legal aid and providing desperately needed housing for domestic violence survivors theresa may continues to turn her back on both survivors and the solutions they need she has made clear that she intends the bill which is still under consultation in parliament to bring in tougher sentences and deliver more convictions this bill will potentially criminalise survivors while distracting from devastating funding cuts to domestic violence services nationwide instead of using this opportunity to strengthen support for domestic violence survivors fleeing abuse the government intends to pump further powers into prisons and policing lying on the red carpet we linked arms and chanted the dv bills a coverup theresa may your time is up because we know that this bill will leave survivors locked up in prison locked out of refuges and locked in to violent relationships can you imagine calling the police for help and ending up in a police cell yourself its already a reality for domestic violence survivors in the uk as highlighted in recent reports about the death of katrina ohara who was murdered after being wrongly investigated by the police this bill will only make such tragic cases more likely in the us similar policies to those this bill is expected to introduce have led to an increase in the number of survivors being arrested especially black and minority ethnic and poorer survivors recent research by the prison reform trust in the uk has already found that survivors report being repeatedly arrested by the police despite their partner being the primary aggressor already of women in prison are survivors of domestic violence they should have received support not sentences if the governments domestic violence and abuse bill centres on the criminal justice system support services will be left to crumble and survivors will remain trapped the solutions and support that survivors truly need are not being offered and the stakes are too high now for us to not take action this bill is a distraction from the conservative austerity cuts that have ripped the domestic violence safety net to pieces refuges are beyond breaking point in england and stand to be lost almost completely if the government proceeds with plans to remove their housing benefit funding if theresa may really cared about domestic violence she would refund these services immediately we chose to target the baftas because the times up movement has made gains in fighting genderbased violence in the entertainment industry and were extending the message to call times up on our own government the police and prisons are no solution to domestic violence the prime minister must give power back to survivors by funding domestic violence refuges and specialist services sisters uncut is a feminist direct action group

the m share the joy campaign launched by the government to promote the policy of shared parental leave is going to fail guaranteed it is a waste of public money at a time of desperate need elsewhere the minimal takeup of shared parental leave in the uk estimated in the absence of reliable statistics at about of eligible couples annually has happened because the policy is wrong in other countries and regions when appropriate sharedleave entitlements have been introduced uptake has soared for example to in iceland in quebec and in portugal these changes happened fast after creating systems that worked for parents as withtaking the lid off a pressure cooker the resulting demand came in a rush so rather than flog a dead horse the government should listen to parents and go back to the drawing board the british system shared parental leave system gives mothers all the leave and then expects them to hand over some of their entitlement to fathers so the very question why dont fathers take up the entitlement which has been asked for years is flawed it is extraordinarily easy to design a system that would work such systems have existed for decades in other countries heres how the first thing to understand is that fathers and mothers want the same thing pewfunded research in the us in found that fathers were just as likely as mothers to say that parenting was extremely important to their identity and respectively the same research found that of fathers felt they were not doing enough caring babycenter research in the same year found one in three fathers feeling overwhelmed by the challenge of meeting unchanged work expectations and radically expanding caring expectations earlier pew research in found that working fathers were as likely as working mothers to say they preferred to be at home with their children but could not because they had to earn instead of fathers v of mothers according to googleipsos in millennial fathers watch more parentingrelated videos on youtube than mothers this means if fathers were to be offered the same as mothers are offered allowing parents to choose absolutely freely on a level playing field fathers would take leave in huge numbers it really is that simple what is currently offered to mothers a woman on an average annual wage of gets in the first year six weeks state maternity pay at of pay plus weeks at making a total of a father gets two weeks at or so fathers get times less a gender pay gap of if the state treated mothers and fathers equally and offered them the same entitlement there would be no need for expensive publicity campaigns men taking time off in the first year would within a year or two become a social norm just like men attending the birth of a baby one company aviva has introduced a policy of treating mothers and fathers among its staff exactly equally this is little short of heroic it is hardly reasonable to expect employers to correct the difference in what government gives mothers and fathers other employers make things worse a survey of companies found that enhanced maternity pay above statutory provisions often to a significant extent but only enhanced paternity pay for even part of the statutory two weeks does this matter absolutely supporting childrens attachments to both their mothers and fathers early in their lives builds the foundation for child development the more fathers care early on the more they tend to invest in the child for the rest of its life and when fathers care more women earn more a swedish study found that for every month of leave taken

women working at britains largest charity earn less on average than men gender pay gap figures reveal the wellcome trust one of the worlds biggest funders of biomedical research is the latest major institution to make public its record on gender and pay under new government rules jeremy farrar director of the wellcome trust said that the figures inevitably make uncomfortable reading an organisation has to face up to uncomfortable things and say were not where we want to be and we want to change that the pay imbalance at wellcome is linked to a disproportionate number of men in the top jobs rather than men and women being paid different salaries for doing the same work the charity said the figures showed that while women make up of wellcomes workforce they represent a minority in the top pay quartile and this imbalance was greatest at the very top tier of pay the median difference in pay between men and women was above the national median of the most dramatic difference was in mean bonuses where men earned more than women on average this figure was strongly skewed by generous performance bonuses offered to senior members of the investments team who manage wellcomes bn portfolio all of whom were men farrar said he was committed to transforming the gender balance at the charity including having a genderbalanced executive leadership team introducing gender bias training for staff and piloting new recruitment processes such as looking beyond academia where most of the top posts are also dominated by men were drawing on sectors that tend to be less diverse in the first place and if we draw from a limited pool were likely to perpetuate that said farrar farrar said that the charity was also revising the payband structure to help identify any cases of unequal pay and that there would be no financial limit set for correcting such inequalities if they emerged government legislation now requires every organisation with more than employees to publish the gender pay and bonus gaps and companies have until april to submit their figures wellcome which spent more than bn on biomedical research last year is one of the first scientific institutions to make its figures public most universities have yet to release their figures although data published last year by the university and college union identified a pay gap of between male and female academic staff prof uta frith an eminent neuroscientist and head of equality and diversity at the royal society said that while it is no surprise that many of the top jobs in science are held by men putting a financial value on these disparities was acting as a wake up call that really does make people embarrassed she said people do feel in a sense valued by the amount of pay they get frith said the problem was not unique to wellcome and that many institutions had failed to appoint senior women for reasons that were complex farrar said that wellcome has been too slow to improve diversity but that the issue was now a priority yes its uncomfortable for many of us but i do think there are moments when history can change and it is one to embrace and make the difference he said prof dame athene donald master of churchill college cambridge said wellcome ought to consider why there was a gender segregation by grade and whether the right people are being promoted for the right reasons making diversity a priority is to be welcomed but wellcome need to be able to demonstrate that progress follows this promise in the years ahead she added,2018-02,woman working britain largest charity earn

longer paid maternity and paternity leave offers parents the chance to spend more time with their babies but the educational benefits for the child vary greatly depending on their background and the parents qualifications according to new research the research found that the children of highly educated middleclass parents gained large and significantly positive effects in later exam results if their parents took longer periods of paid leave after they were born the effect was particularly significant for boys according to academics from warwick and munich universities their research provides the first concrete results on how parental leave can affect childrens cognitive development the study also found that for parents with no postschool education longer maternity leave equated to lower results in exams taken by their children as teenagers although the authors said the effects were not as clear the researchers from warwick and the ifo institute in munich found no overall effect on childrens later results from extending parental leave from one to two years but looking at the results in detail they were surprised to reveal a strong split based on parental education natalia danzer the deputy director of the ifo centre for labour and demographic economics said the striking thing when we looked at individual groups was the significant difference that depended on the educational background of the mothers these are robust results that stood up through all types of tests danzer said the study was the first of its type to look at the extended length of maternity leave and longterm education results thanks to a quirk in austrian politics that saw the length of paid maternity and paternity leave double almost overnight the research by danzer and prof victor lavy of warwick university published in the february issue of the royal economic societys journal uses data collected after austria abruptly extended paid leave from one year to two years for children born after june although the data comes from austria the similar levels of income and education in its population meant the findings were relevant for other developed countries including the uk the authors compared the educational outcomes of children born on either side of the start of the new policy using results from exams taken years later the negative effects seen among the children of parents with lower levels of education might be caused by reduced time and material resources in part because they left shorter gaps between having more children while the battle for paid maternity leave has been won in most developed countries the subject of how generous it should be remains a live issue among developed countries the average duration of paid leave for mothers has increased from weeks in to about a year now about half of eu member countries grant paid maternity leave lasting months or more the us remains an outlier among developed economies by offering no national paid maternity leave the authors say the research is highly relevant in countries lacking sufficient formal childcare places outside the home for children under the age of two to what extent such negative effects can be mitigated or reversed through a highquality formal day care system is an open question the paper notes previous research published in the quarterly journal of economics which looked at the effect on maternal labour market supply found that the doubling of paid parental leave had no effect on the medium to longterm employment and earnings of the mothers,2018-02,longer paid maternity

in a case that could cost it bn tesco is fighting an equal pay claim over its hourly rate for work on the checkout for work in the warehouse by startling and unfortunately for the grocer actionable coincidence the checkout staff are mainly women an army of while the warehouse staff are mainly men in in birmingham the council lost a landmark case against its care workers who fought for six years to be paid as much as the bin men the cases resemble one another but arent identical in birmingham care workers and bin men were on the same rate yet refuse work came with substantial overtime and bonuses while in care work weekends christmases and overnights were a regular part of what you do when you care in the tesco battle the asymmetry is ascribed by commentators to the fact that in warehouses you have to move heavy stuff and operate machinery and besides if women want to work in warehouses all they need to do is apply that is the hotbutton paygap question of the day do women choose lowpaid sectors because they are more naturally suited to them or is this all a gender construct with the patriarchy putting centuries of graft into persuading one sex that they are hardwired to do the stuff the other sex doesnt like the look of always happy to wade into a fight about gender essentialism i sometimes forget to reject the premise it doesnt matter why women go into femaledominated sectors the only question that matters is why womens work is less wellpaid i once heard a trade unionist describe the skills involved in care work they are soft sympathy empathy imagination ability to strategise preempt lead and plan and hard significant medical expertise the reason these skills werent valued was because they werent measured and that was because there wasnt a guild that meant no recognised skillset no career structure and no progression it was neat but the same could be said for other maledominated fields where the pay stagnation is nothing like as bad childcare is almost universally conceived by everyone except those who have done it as the easiest job in the world in fact it is so demanding physically emotionally and intellectually that any other

lining is that they seem to lack the competence to enact it could wait apparently while we sorted out our language on tuesday may rallied with a fresh plan designed to remind her party of its common goals it was dismissed as a bromide by one anonymous tory source but in fact a platitude is something with which all reasonable people agree her points on the contrary didnt even cohere from the start of the sentence to the end she wants government debt to fall but government spending to rise nhs funding to rise but taxes to fall she wants a brexit that guarantees the greatest possible access to european markets but that would be notbrexit she wants to tackle the injustices that hold people back from achieving their true potential yet she also wants to remain prime minister this is so far

women who work parttime after having children are likely to suffer the extremes of the gender pay gap according to fresh research showing how working mothers are missing out on pay progression by the time a first child has reached the age of mothers earn almost a third less per hour on average than similarly educated fathers according to research from the institute for fiscal studies ifs undertaken for the joseph rowntree foundation the stark difference in pay according to gender comes as a consequence of the poorer levels of pay progression open to parttime workers with women making up the vast majority of people taking temporary jobs as they look to find more flexible working arrangements after having children as a result they miss out on earnings growth associated with staying in a permanent job there are fears that progress in closing the gender pay gap has stalled with the latest figures showing that the average female employee currently earns around less per hour than the average male employee while that has come down from about in the early s the difference remains high about a quarter of the wage gap identified by the ifs comes as a result of mothers taking parttime work while just a tenth of the gap is down to women taking time out of the labour market altogether for a prolonged period of time the report also highlights how womens pay suffers at the hands of a cultural norm among nuclear families whereby women more typically juggle work with looking after children than their male partners for men parttime employment rates were essentially unaffected by the arrival of a first child while women were shown to be significantly more likely than men to still be in parttime jobs when their first child reaches adulthood the lack of earnings growth in parttime work has a particularly big impact for graduate women because they would typically stand to gain the most from rising levels of pay from remaining in fulltime paid work the report found that the wage gap has not fallen at all in the last years for the highesteducated women due to this trend the government has set a deadline for businesses with more than staff to report their gender pay gap by april some companies have already started reporting including the bbc which has faced sharp criticism after highprofile female employees were found to have salaries significantly lower than their male counterparts monica costa dias of the ifs said it is remarkable that periods spent in parttime work lead to virtually no wage progression at all it should be a priority for

if our weinstein moment was to be a true societal shift there were bound to be some casualties while the obvious guesses might be male abusers and exploitative bosses though few could have predicted that some of the first would be women themselves namely formula ones grid girls who will find themselves unemployed as of next season they are the latest battleground in what has ultimately been a longfought feminist war which has at various times seen arguments about the suns page kim kardashians nude selfies dancers in music videos and any number of other zeitgeist flashpoints these women are sexually objectified the argument goes reduced to nothing but their desirability they send the wrong message to young girls and women those who posit this argument would have you believe that their opponents can be easily divided into two camps sleazy men who advocate for womens right to do this work in order to protect their gratification and those who argue that such work is a choice women are entitled to make and that it may even be empowering for women to use their bodies in these ways for an argument that is ostensibly about work though any analysis of labour itself is conspicuously missing from the above perspectives if our postweinstein reckoning is to mean anything at all our responses have to take a third form structural and grounded in the experiences of realworld women rather than discomfort projected on to those we imagine to be objectified working conditions then would seem a better place to start than sweeping moral judgments on the type of work itself for their part many of formula ones grid girls seemed perfectly happy with theirs with many tweeting and speaking in media appearances on thursday about good pay job satisfaction and being treated with respect by colleagues and bosses were they empowered by their work maybe maybe not maybe some days they felt content and fulfilled maybe on others they felt broke and tired and frustrated by their reliance on a onedimensional job that didnt make use of all their skills and experiences bus drivers shop assistants cleaners and baristas can sympathise its just that nobody chooses to ask them empowerment it seems is a measure applied only to the types of work occupied primarily by women the problem with objectification as a concept is that it necessarily requires a beholder within whose eye it takes place its a process that happens to an imagined passive woman not a decision taken by an active one and its rarely employed in any context other than that of a womans sexuality in a societal moment that emerged as a result of women speaking and finally being taken seriously its paradoxical that the objectification label has been projected on to grid girls largely against their will and counter to their own accounts of the work they do sexism harassment and exploitation abound in the pr modelling and hostessing worlds as evidenced by the financial timess recent expos of the presidents club to really listen to what the women working in these industries have to say might be to discover more presidents clubs and harvey weinsteins instead a narrative has been imposed on them because it fits better than the one they wrote for themselves saying i believe you when women disclose bad experiences requires doing the same when they dont any tipping point concerned with structural misogyny and sexual harassment has to take as its currency the firsthand experiences of women themselves rather than the interpretations of outside observers after all if you cant look at a glamorous woman dressed in skimpy clothes and imagine that she is also a complex human being with many other skills and interests then it says more about your prejudices than it does the woman in front of you the issue isnt one of objectification or empowerment and its not about some intrinsic right to be sexy rather its about recognising that we all live in a deeply exploitative and unequal capitalist society where we are each grid girl or not objectified by work and reduced to our ability to perform its tasks the real battleground is for good working conditions strong trade unions and a redressed power balance between workers and bosses so that sexual harassment and structural misogyny can truly be tackled at their roots whatever the industry if youre worried about sending confusing messages to little girls

the foster carers quoted in anna bawdens article councils face a huge hike in costs as foster carers jump ship january expressed the same sentiments and experiences of many foster carers i interviewed over a year period in a series of research studies it is indisputable that generally independent fostering agencies ifas provide far better support and training opportunities to their foster carers and smaller workloads for their social workers as a result their retention and recruitment of both are far less problematic than those that local authority fostering agencies face and have generally faced throughout that period however this does not mean ifas need to be in the private sector to achieve such foster carer and social worker satisfaction in fact before the implementation of the care standards act in most ifas were voluntary notforprofit organisations and some still are the central issue linking bawdens article and aditya chakraborttys how private equity barons turn childrens pain into profit january is that an effective and fully functioning fostering service can and should be one where accountable local authorities supplemented by the voluntary sector provide a public service for the public good instead by allowing the private sector to flourish a twotier service has been created at considerable additional costs but with little evidence of improvement to fostered childrens longterm outcomes dr clive sellick reader emeritus in social work university of east anglia my career was in social work we were good at fostering concentrated on preventing family breakdown and keeping people living independently my husband had huntingtons disease and i looked after him through years of physical and mental illness while doing a stressful job and bringing up two children i am with the usual complex of elderly medical problems i am trying to support my yearold son who has inherited the disease he is going through a mental health crisis and i am teetering on the verge of collapse now and over the years i have called for help in every direction but we fail to meet the criteria ive had plenty of advice which involves me with my limited mobility and stamina chasing deadend solutions we should have had a support worker years ago but social and mental health services are so underfunded that they have developed strategies to avoid taking on work he lives independently and could remain so given social support the gps are wonderful perhaps because unlike fostering they have remained small private businesses but they are terribly overworked and not able to provide social support how long before their funding is handed over to private equity as part of the secret privatisation of the nhs without journalists to follow the money how would we know name

a law setting a gold standard for domestic abuse legislation by incorporating both emotional and physical violence into the same offence is expected to be passed by the scottish parliament the domestic abuse bill which has crossparty backing creates a specific offence of abusive behaviour in relation to a partner or expartner this will cover not only physical abuse but other forms of psychological abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour that cannot easily be prosecuted using the existing criminal law it is expected to be passed on thursday welcoming the fundamentally innovative legislation dr marsha scott chief executive of scottish womens aid said women have been telling us for years that it is emotional abuse that is most harmful one of the unique things about this bill is that it privileges the experiences of women and children thats why scotlands approach to domestic abuse is so radical the new law allows the police and courts to pursue someone on a course of conduct offence that is a single offence where physical psychological and coercive behaviour can be prosecuted at once this reflects a growing understanding that domestic abuse is often a course of behaviour that extends over a period of time and includes not only physical violence the offence also includes a reasonable person test for example would a reasonable person consider that limiting a womans access to her bank account or prescribing her meal times or moving her car while she was asleep all cases that scottish womens aid have encountered amounted to controlling behaviour holyroods justice secretary michael matheson also announced of dedicated training funding for scottish womens aid he said the voices of women and children who have experienced domestic abuse are at the heart of this bill and that is why it is so important for these provisions to operate effectively one of the critical things is that those in contact with women who could benefit from its provisions understand exactly what psychological abuse and coercive control is this builds on additional funding announced over the festive period to train police officers in the new legislation since the introduction of an offence of coercive control in england in concerns have been raised that it is not being used enough and has created an unhelpful hierarchy of harms in part due to a lack of specialist training for police officers prof evan stark the former forensic social worker who first developed the concept of coercive control and heavily influenced the westminster legislation described the scottish bill as a new gold standard responding to criticism that the new offence was too broad and that evidence of psychological abuse was harder to gather stark said there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that creating this broad offence will lead to reduced reporting or policing of simple assaults when the new definition of abuse was announced in england reports skyrocketed but the critics are right about one thing what matters now is what happens when the first calls come in under the new law how will the police and the courts respond to that first caller who insists violence wasnt the worst part will she be told talk about the violence or what we hope shell hear yes i know what you mean,2018-02,law setting gold standard domestic abuse legislation

eton college the school that boasts of educating more british prime ministers than any other has revealed a gender pay gap among its staff well above the national average but below some of its rivals including westminster school figures published by eton as part of a report on pay and gender required by the government show that the median hourly pay of female members of staff was below that of men that compares with the national average pay gap according to the governments statisticians westminster reported a median hourly pay gap of more than which means that when comparing median hourly rates women working at the school earn p for every that men earn william waldegrave the provost of eton said the school was concerned with redressing the gender balance in staff and pay and had several plans underway we recognise we have further work to do to increase the number of women and other groups currently underrepresented in our teaching community lord waldegrave said in a statement accompanying the release the school has recently named dame helena morrissey the head of personal investing at legal and general as a fellow and last year appointed the first woman as deputy head in etons year history the figures also revealed that etons strong workforce was split between men and women with about of the total employed as teachers as a school most of our higher paid staff are our teaching staff like many singlesex schools our teachers are still predominantly of the same gender as the pupils this factor combined with a low turnover of teaching staff means that our more highly paid teachers tend to be male the school said etons pay gap was put in the shade by some of those reported by statefunded multiacademy trusts with several reporting pay gaps almost twice as high as of pm on friday six academy chains had reported gender pay gaps of more than while the chains make up a high proportion of institutions reporting the widest gaps between genders westminster said that its gender pay gap should not be confused with equal pay equal pay is about differences in actual earnings of men and women doing equal work the school charges a year for day pupils and a year for boarders with girls only admitted in the sixth form about of the schools staff were men with men making up the majority of senior management and senior teachers the upper quartile for pay had of men and just of women the significantly larger pay gap arises in the support staff area due to an imbalance of male and female staff in different job roles across the school westminster said in its statement accompanying the report other famous public schools with wide pay gaps included shrewsbury with a gap in median hourly pay but the worst offender among independent schools based on figures published by the friday deadline was that of the royal hospital school in ipswich which reported a median pay gap of the royal hospital school said that while women made up a majority of its workforce twothirds worked as support staff including cleaners and laundry staff but the figures also show huge variations in pay and employment patterns throughout the independent schools sector as in the state school sector with some schools managing relatively equal pay distribution while other similar schools showed a wide gap the dragon school in oxford famous for educating a string of actors

groundbreaking legislation forcing companies to disclose their gender pay gap for the first time has revealed that almost nine out of public sector organisations pay men more than women as government departments councils nhs trusts universities schools and other public bodies with more than employees scrambled to report their gender pay gap before the midnight deadline on friday reported figures revealed that women in the public sector are paid on average less than their male colleagues despite threats that organisations could face court if they failed to report their gender pay gap a number of public sector organisations which employ of the uk workforce were yet to submit their figures at pm on march hours before the deadline the figures compiled as part of a datagathering exercise unmatched across the globe have provided unprecedented insight into the pay structures of public bodies revealing the most genderbalanced workforces and those with more work to do these figures show us what we expected we still see an underrepresentation of women at the top and and overrepresentation at the bottom said sam smethers chief executive of the fawcett society the public sector matters for women because it is women who are overwhelmingly dependent on public services so getting women into decisionmaking positions is key in the nhs one of the biggest employers in the world where of the workforce are women significant pay gaps have been exposed the queen victoria hospital nhs foundation trust in east grinstead had the dubious honour of having the worst median pay gap with women paid an average of p for every a man is paid in an accompanying report the trust which is made up of threequarters women said the figure was influenced by its size and the fact that consultants who were more than twice as likely to be men made up a higher proportion of its workforce than other trusts it had not responded to requests for further comment on the gap at the time of writing local government which employs more than million people of whom are women has also come under scrutiny of the councils north hertfordshire district council had the worst median gender pay gap at the council whose workforce is women and men said of its top roles were taken by men while women dominated the lowestpaid roles such as in administration a spokesperson said many of these jobs are parttime andor

average a woman earns p women are also underrepresented in the top quartile at the department which is male the department says the gap is explained by a higher number of men in specialist transport roles and that it is making efforts to close the gap a spokesperson for the department said while women are in the majority at the very top of the department for transport including a female permanent secretary and the most senior female jobshare partnership in government these figures clearly show that we still have work to do to reduce the gender pay gap the office for nuclear regulation reported

practices in the public sector are likely to be drawn more transparent pay structures increased flexible working job shares and parttime roles provided more opportunities for women in the public sector said smethers but she added that recent highprofile pay discrimination cases in local authorities such as fife birmingham north lanarkshire and glasgow as well as the new gender pay gap figures exposed persistent sexism in we should not be seeing pay discrimination against women its fundamentally wrong and we have to sort it out however although the figures highlight the inequalities between men and womens standing in the workplace how much the figures really tell us about the gender pay gap is limited by the figures the government has requested all the figures relate to the average pay of full and parttime employees in this case where a group employs a large number of parttime workers positions typically held by women pay gap may be amplified by a large number of women in parttime work despite the limitations the figures shone a much needed light on gender inequality in the workplace said kate bell head of economic and social policy at the tuc these figures show us that we have a long way to go before we close the gender pay gap in the public sector and it is forcing us to ask why she said we still have pay discrimination there is still a lack of women in the highest paid jobs and there is a still a stark difference in how we value work that is traditionally seen as men or womens work we knew much of this but seeing inequality in your own workplace really brings it

the equalities watchdog has insisted it will pursue companies that submit inaccurate figures on their gender pay gaps after multiple firms appeared to file questionable information public sector employers with more than staff are legally obliged to publish their gender pay gap by friday while private firms and charities have until wednesday april about of a estimated total of organisations had filed results by thursday but with just days to go until the final deadline questions have been raised about the quality of some of the data being filed some companies having entered zeros in all fields reported mathematically impossible bonus gaps and removed key workers alongside the hourly wage figure companies must disclose their bonus pay gap and reveal the proportion of men and women in each quartile of their business companies must give both their mean and median gender pay gap at pm on thursday at least companies had filed suspect figures on the government equalities office website stating they had no mean or median gender pay gap and an equal split of male and female workers in every quartile several companies contacted by the guardian who filed figures of zero in all areas of the government website said they had not yet filed their official figures or said the figures had been entered in error others could not be contacted or declined to comment i think calling the data variable is a fair comment said mark crail content director at xperthr and its pretty obviously that some people have got it wrong or at least very unlikely others seem to have put in figures as holding positions that will be updated there is certainly enough of that for it to be a worry in one case figures for three different companies were filed by the same hr manager with the exact same figures with no gender pay gap and an equal divide of men and women throughout the company it is a legal requirement that company information is signed off at director level other companies have filed mathematically impossible figures at least have reported a bonus gap of more than one company reported an hourly mean gender pay gap of implying that for every earned by a man a woman would pay a spokesperson at the company declined to comment following the april deadline the ehrc the equalities watchdog responsible for enforcing the gender pay gap regulations has the power to write to companies that have filed questionable statistics and demand clarification we have mechanisms in place to identify questionable data and have the power to enforce against any employer whose published information doesnt comply with the legal requirements said ehrcs chief executive rebecca hilsenrath a number of companies have also resubmitted their figures hugo boss changed its gender pay gap figures three times at the end of after questions were raised about the plausibility of the figures by the financial times companies had been given a year and detailed guidance from acas on how to calculate and submit data said a gender pay gap expert helene reardonbond a former senior civil servant who played a key role in shaping the requirement there is absolutely no excuse to get it wrong because the calculations are all there she said this does matter because it is not fair on the companies who file accurately its a matter of competitiveness some companies have also been accused of not being fully transparent about their gender pay gap while sticking to the letter of the law after filing initial figures pwc published its revised pay gap data to include partners as did ey and deloitte but only one of the top five law firms clifford chance has included the pay of partners who tend to be better paid and disproportionately male businesses have also used press releases to divert attention from the full extent of the gap making it impossible to rely on the nonstatutory figures slaughter amp may reported a gender pay gap of in its services division however in a press release it noted that gap was greatly reduced if it excluded the secretaries all of whom are women from its figures others questioned the viability of the data julian jessop chief economist at the institute of economic affairs said looking at the percentage of men and women in each quartile of the business especially the number of women at the top and the bottom could be a more useful exercise than comparing hourly gender pay gaps clearly there is still plenty of discrimination in the workforce but the pay gap being revealed is not necessarily revealing that its a pretty crude way to get to

craigslist shut down its personals section entirely last week this left me shaken for what it portends about my own sexual history with craiglists mm personals about the safety of sex workers and about the growing surveillance of sexual freedoms in the us the reason for the shutdown the us congress had just passed the fight online sex trafficking act fosta and stop enabling sex trafficking act sesta bills donald trump seems likely to sign these antisex bills into law even as the nation hears all about him allegedly getting spanked by adult film star stormy daniels as craigslist explained on its site fosta seeks to subject websites to criminal and civil liability when third parties users misuse online personals unlawfully if any sex work happens on their site craigslist itself could be sued we cant take such risk without jeopardizing all our other services so we are regretfully taking craigslist personals offline the ever simple internet billboard wrote hopefully we can bring them back some day to the millions of spouses partners and couples who met through craigslist we wish you every happiness that kind sentiment hit me hard one frigid february night in a few weeks after my mother had died deep in the darkest winter of my life i responded to a craigslist ad in the men seeking men category we met that night and had sex afterwards we talked a bit in that lovely postorgasmic way gay men sometimes do in that space of connection that craigslist mm has made possible for me to meet other gay men in the far reaches of the globe he was a smart and delightful man we didnt live in the same city but later when we did we dated for several years except in very rare instances shame and embarrassment kept me from ever telling anyone that id met this boyfriend in this way but he became one of the great loves of my life and is still a dear friend its sad that no one else will get to meet their boyfriends or missed connections on craigslist any more but my sadness isnt only about the loss of respectable connections i mourn all the connections people had through craigslist that were meaningful for them including sex work craiglist mm was fundamental to exploring my budding sexuality and i hooked up with guys through it in my s i dont have the kind of face or body that generated much interest on matchcom when i was in my s and i still dont have the right looks to generate any interest on grindr or tinder but sometimes in the flirting exchange of emails generated by craiglist ads i found men to explore with sometimes sexually sometimes not its a tragedy other people wont have the freedom to explore as i did in this way but stymying sexual acts like mine wasnt even the primary intent of sesta or fosta the major purpose of these bills is to conflate coerced sex tracking with willing sex work as well as to better punish anyone who willingly engages in sex work and any website that facilitates it this is a particular economic assault on people who are queer trans andor formerly incarcerated who have been locked out of other forms of earning income as senior reporter at in justice today melissa gira grant has been writing for some time these bills are opposed by survivors of sex trafficking and will put the lives of sex workers ever more at risk the answer now is to make sex work legal and to facilitate ways it can be done more safely not to drive it more underground more people should care about sex workers rights but if you think none of this applies to you because youre not queer or into kink or sex work think again the us congress wants to further regulate sex by way of the internet and most peoples modern sex lives interact with the internet craigslist shut down its entire personal section because of the overreaching congressional desire to control sex work and theres no reason congress couldnt similarly intimidate tinder or grindr to remove you or shut down entirely as it has craigslist and then where would you be there has been worry that the metoo movement could lead to a sex panic but the real sex panic is not due to feminism run amok but due to the patriarchal homophobic transantagonistic theocratic desire of the us congress to control sex workers and by extension to smother the sexual desires of any of us who dont want to conform to their puritanical ways steven w thrasher is writeratlarge for

more than of councils and nine out of nhs trusts have a gender pay gap thats the stark finding based on submissions from town halls and english nhs trusts this year for the first time all organisations in great britain with more than employees will have to publish gender pay gap data by the end of this week all public sector bodies in england should have submitted their gender pay gap data scotland and wales already publish their figures while the deadline for private and voluntary organisations is april the government equalities office says it will use the results to better understand the causes of the gender pay gap and to target our efforts effectively as we continue work towards eliminating it yet despite warnings this week from the equality and human rights commission that any organisation failing to report its figures would be breaching the law and could face enforcement action as of march around half of all upper tier and district councils and twothirds of nhs trusts had yet to submit their data currently the national median hourly gender pay gap for fulltime and parttime workers in the uk economy is according to office for national statistics figures in the nhs and local government the picture is mixed even accounting for inaccurate reporting despite having longstanding pay scales and an overwhelmingly female workforce sometimes at senior levels many councils and nhs trusts have aboveaverage pay gaps of the councils that have reported so far have median hourly gender pay gaps of more than the national average while in the nhs six trusts have median gender pay gaps in excess of the national average four nhs trusts and councils have median pay gaps above in local government tonbridge and malling borough council has the largest gap followed by breckland district council with a gap of at dartford council it is in the nhs doncaster and bassetlaw teaching hospitals nhs foundation trust posted a gender pay gap of the royal orthopaedic hospital in birmingham has a gap of while it is at burton hospitals nhs foundation trust while most have gaps that favour men some have pay gaps that favour women at liverpool community health nhs trust womens median pay is higher than mens while at bradford district care foundation trust and sussex community nhs foundation trust it is and higher for women respectively among the councils with pay gaps favouring women the largest gaps were at three rivers district council and pendle borough council while four councils had gaps in excess of john appleby the director of research and chief economist at the nuffield trust thinktank welcomes gender pay gap reporting but warns that the headline figures dont tell the full story all of these are just percentages says appleby its very basic data it would be nice to see the actual pay a lot is going on within one organisation and really all weve got is two numbers there is a whole host of factors buried behind those numbers some of it will be warranted and some of it will be a bit fuzzy and maybe its not to do with discrimination directly but to do with the way society is organised or the relationships between men and women and the way we treat women who have children and maybe we dont make it as easy as possible to get back into work at the level they left at or even higher then there may be some more overt discrimination because employers can get away with it so how do we identify those different things modality partnership which runs gp surgeries across different locations has the dubious honour of topping the list so far with a median hourly rate gender pay gap of on its website the gp superpartnership reported that of its staff which includes doctors nurses and healthcare professionals as well as receptionists and administrators were women vincent sai a nonclinical partner at modalitysays the company has an equal pay policy and offers equal opportunities for progression through development and training for all its staff he says more of its gps are male not out of choice but due to a general shortage of gps the numbers are what they are because of what we have as a workforce he says should always look for opportunities to improve but the discrepancy does not necessarily mean there is an equal pay issue the median is the figure that falls in the middle of a range when the wages of all the staff in an organisation are lined up from smallest to largest the median gap is the difference between the employee in the middle of the range of male wages and the middle employee in the range of female wages equal pay gaps arise where men and women doing the same job or work of equal value are paid differently the main causes of these pay gaps are simple pay discrimination a disproportionate number of men in the highest paid jobs andor the lack of highquality parttime work and flexible working says scarlet harris womens equality officer at the tuc a tuc report found that women who work parttime earn less than women working fulltime i was at a meeting where a woman said she came back from maternity leave requested to work flexibly and was told she could only do that if she took a job that was two grades below the job she was previously doing says harris that was in the public sector and she took a pay cut another was told that the only way she could work flexibly would be to take a job at a different hospital that was two hours away its a huge issue because its not about women leaving the workplace altogether but how it affects their progression and their ability to maintain the level they were at in terms of their careers the extent of pay gaps in the nhs and local government is surprising given the existence of longstanding pay structures and pay scales but nicola lee a national officer at the royal college of nursing thinks the problem in the nhs lies not in equal pay issues but inequality of opportunity in terms of pay progression why is it that senior posts still dont represent the wider demographics of the workforce she asks lee says there are institutional barriers preventing flexible working and the lack of parttime jobs in more highly paid positions at more senior levels its historically been frowned upon to job share or do compressed hours however some town halls and nhs bodies seem to be faring much better thirty councils and four nhs trusts had pay gaps of or less in either direction while town halls and three trusts did not have a pay gap christina mcanea assistant general secretary of unison the countrys largest public sector union says the worst breaches of unequal pay have been largely ironed out in health and local government but there is an issue around how certain job types are remunerated people will go to a nursery and drop their child off and then go to a tube station and the person checking tickets will be earning substantially more than the person working in the nursery looking after their prized possession mcanea says and thats not individuals thats a fact because we as a society dont place the same value on things like childcare or cooking or cleaning or things that are traditionally seen as womens jobs so the pay is at the bottom of the pile claire kober chair of the local government associations resources board says that more progress has been made in town halls than in many other sectors addressing gender pay disparities through fundamental reviews of pay and grading structures and promoting equality in all staffing decisions but adds that there is no room for complacency gender pay reporting will ensure the talents of men and women are recognised equally and fairly in all workplaces including in local government and help to ensure that councils draw talent from both sexes across different levels of income and seniority says kober danny mortimer the chief executive of nhs employers acknowledges more can be done around flexible working he says we accept that across our workforce not just for senior colleagues but for every part of our workforce there is more we can do there is already a commitment to achieve a gender balance at nhs board level by he says and a network has been set up to identify some of the barriers to progression for women leaders with salaries for senior medics seen as a key driver of discrepancies in the nhs the department of health and social care is about to review the gender pay gap in medicine for now the pay deal announced last week for the bulk of nhs staff except doctors and very senior managers up to for the lowest paid should help reduce the gender pay gap by lifting pay and narrowing pay bands but as these figures show even pay bands arent a panacea and whats needed is a culture shift additional reporting by

breathing and storytelling arent the usual tools wielded to tackle the gender gap in the uks public bodies but back in those techniques were deployed as part of an initiative to increase the number of senior female leaders in the department for business innovation and skills an innovative training programme using drama teachers to instil confidence including through breathing and storytelling was just one of a series of departmental changes including flexible working and mentoringit seemed to have worked by bis claimed to have gender parity a split in its leadership team but there were two crucial questions the then head of bis martin donnelly overlooked he might briefly have had equal numbers of men and women in his senior management team but was that sustainable and more importantly across the whole department were men and women getting a fair pay deal roll forward three years to the governments own mandatory reporting on gender pay and the answer is clear women who work at the department for business energy and industrial strategy as bis has become are paid less on median average than men the departments report published ahead of the march deadline for public bodies to provide information on pay for men and women spells out the painful detail the main reason for the gender pay gap is that there are more men in higher grades far from achieving gender parity the department has failed to promote women to its most senior levels of the organisations highestpaid quarter of staff are men this is part of a pattern across the civil service which has known for years that its got a problem as unlike most private uk companies it has been tracking gender pay in its annual staff survey the first full gender pay gap survey was carried out in december leading the head of the civil service sir jeremy heywood to acknowledge that there was a median gender pay gap of across the service and that representation of women at the highest grades of the civil service is not what it should be all main departments and several government agencies have now filed their results ahead of the march deadline there are big differences despite the department of health and social care having more women than men among its highestpaid staff it still has a median gender pay gap thats higher than the ministry of communities local government and housingformerly the department for communities and local government where a gap is below the civil service average the ministry of justice has a median pay gap but the home office has a gap in more specialist agencies the picture is worse nhs digital has a median pay gap and homes england has a shocking median pay gap for instance of the highestpaid quarter of staff are men and the median pay gap is but at the department for work and pensions of the highestpaid staff are women and the median pay gap is the government legal department pays its female staff a mere less than its male employees but theres a real problem in transport the department for transport has the biggest gender pay gap of the main departments paying women less than men of its highestpaid staff are men while the situation is reversed among its lowestpaid staff of whom are men and women the rail regulator has an even higher pay gap paying women on median average less than men only a tiny handful of civil service bodies pay women more than men at the care quality commission median pay for women is higher than for men while women at the national archives get more the largest pay gap in favour of female civil servants is at the food standards agency where women are on average paid more than men in analmost apologetic report the agency says this is because of its male staff work in the two most junior grades many of them as meat hygiene inspectors while the average pay of women was raised because until last march its chief executive was a woman traditionally the civil service has regarded itself as a relatively flexible working environment with a number of initiatives including senior job shares and womens networks to encourage and support women but it has been caught in a vicious pincer movement not only has it failed to promote female civil servants to the highest ranks with only of the senior civil service who are women and only five female permanent secretaries running the biggest departments its rubbing salt in the wound by hiring in higherpaid men from the private sector to fill in gaps in areas such as digital and technology and business areas like oil and gas experts theres a bigger question here about why society regards it as necessary to pay jobs in transport defence oil gas and digital more than jobs in say meat inspection heywood may have acknowledged the problem but civil servants want to know what is going to happen if theres one lesson were learning from all the gender pay gap reports its that no one is doing as well as they had hoped and all the breathing and storytelling in the world cant mend that only real action will do last week the foreign office appointed its first female black high commissioner nnenne iwujieme to which the only reasonable response is what took so

as the deadline for companies and public bodies to report on their gender pay gap draws nearer the appalling revelations continue on monday the telegraph media groups abysmal gap was dwarfed by that of some schools lets call it a plumbing of new depths the most popular career for graduate women teaching doubles as a hothouse for pay inequality and our conservative government with its push on academies and performancerelated pay prp for teachers has to admit its instrumental role in transforming an already pernicious structural inequality into something gross the power of collective bargaining has been foundational to the movement for equal pay from the strike of women card setters in scholes west yorkshire followed a year later by the women power loom weavers association in glasgow womens individual interests have been best served through group action women do not need the likes of andy haldane the chief economist at the bank of england to tell them that there is a clear wage premium associated with trade union membership we already know it it is why women make up the majority of union members and why those of us that do will on average earn more than women not in unions in being made able to work outside of pay and conditions negotiated by teaching unions academies have in effect been given the freedom to exacerbate pay inequality for women this papers own analysis of data from the governments national survey on the pay gap proves just that it is a damning indictment of key tory education policy the expansion of academies and performancerelated pay prp it is also yet another example of why this government is so reluctant to publish details on the impact of its policies based on gender race disability class and age women working in a number of academy chains are paid less than half of their male counterparts schoolsworks academy trust in west sussex which runs six schools has a median hourly pay gap of in favour of men while the wakefield city academies trust which managed schools before folding last year had a figure of of the companies with the worst gender pay gap happen to be multiacademy chains to any teacher reading the above this wont come as much of a surprise in michael gove announced that prp would make teaching a more attractive career and a more rewarding job that would give greater flexibility to respond to specific conditions and reward their best teachers teachers of whom are women gave a collective eye roll in an era of swingeing cuts the real meaning behind those words were plain men who make up of secondary school teachers and yet account for of headteachers would go on to view their best as other men they would invest in younger men with no childcare responsibilities that tear them away from work for a year who are uninterested in working part time and do not have to rush home before pm to get the tea ready women already shouldering a shameful of the burden of austerity would as ever continue to be disproportionately affected by public sector cuts excuses as to why the gender pay gap exists handily arrive at the same spot as women we ourselves are to blame we lack ambition rather than being overlooked for promotion we are too demure to ask for more rather than knowing that opaque pay structures only further the possibility that we will be viewed as pushy and thankless when we do it is exactly such thinking that powers the steep wage inequality uncovered in so many academy trusts how interesting it is that of the teachers eligible for pay progression in a quarter of those who were denied it worked part time and by virtue of that fact are more likely to be women incidentally nearly a third of black and minority ethnic teachers were shock horror not granted pay progression that schools will reflect wider social inequalities should not be news to anyone what is galling though is the governments apparent lack of care or consideration when it comes to the impact on wage packets that their academies push has had on women and black and minority ethnic teachers we were told that academies would propel school standards up evidence for such claims were at best tenuous yet it is an idea that has nevertheless taken hold considered true merely because it has been repeated often enough its persuasive because wedded to it yet never fully articulated is the notion that teachers in academies work harder precisely because their schools do not have to respect teachers rights to decent working conditions academies merely reveal the truth behind all of that dissembling they are a drive aimed at deregulating schools and cutting costs women are paying most dearly for it reading the now daily revelations of what the gender pay gap means for working women is however dismal hopeful finally we are armed with concrete material where once there was only opacity in the case of academies it is clear that for many their business model is based on the continued devaluation of women how

children growing up in the norths most deprived communities face a double whammy of familial disadvantage and poor institutional performance with up to of children in some areas dropping out of education and training before they are a report has found despite parts of the urban north experiencing rapid regeneration as the governments northern powerhouse project progresses many children girls in particular feel they will not benefit from what they view as just a few shiny new buildings according to the childrens commissioner anne longfield she is calling on the poorest northern children to be put at heart of the northern powerhouse having spent the past year travelling across the north of england interviewing students and their teachers and carers for a new report growing up north one of her most unacceptable findings is that despite the law now requiring children to stay in education or training until a disproportionate number are dropping out earlier in the north several northern council areas have more than of children missing out on crucial parts of their education twice the english average she said in knowsley merseyside are not in education or training neet in manchester salford and middlesbrough of unders fall into this category its absolutely not acceptable said longfield insisting that addressing the neet issue has to be an urgent priority to turbocharge those childrens futures she suggested these children were being forgotten because technology enabled them to stay indoors playing online rather than hanging around in public places kids less and less go out and hang around thats why people get less and less worried about seeing them theyre at home theyre online playing games she said northern children who do alevels have good chances of attending university and the best chance in the country of going into an apprenticeship the report says yet those in receipt of free school meals in london are more likely to get good gcse results in maths and english and twice as likely to go to university than children receiving free school meals in the north longfield found significant differences in the career aspirations of northern boys and girls and what they believed their local area offered them what we heard from girls is that they had much less confidence in things changing said longfield the report says that although girls continue to outperform boys in school they are paid less as adults and still do not see themselves in certain wellpaid jobs this is a particular issue in many northern areas where regeneration strategies focus on science and engineeringfocused industries still perceived as male says the report it adds there was a fear particularly pronounced amongst girls that regeneration was about a few shiny buildings new shops and pavements but not much more in this sense many young people felt that regeneration was something happening to their city but not to them the report found that children were proud to be northern and did not want to live in london many felt there were more opportunities and more money available in the capital but most did not want to live there for any length of time because of a variety of pressures associated with living in the south even those with a very particular career intention were more likely to want to pursue this abroad than in london longfield found children didnt say i want us to be like london at all she said in parts of the northwest disadvantaged areas of liverpool and manchester they said they wanted their cities to be like new york i think they are aware that london is somewhere where you have to have a lot of money just to maintain your lifestyle day in day out poor schools continued to hold children back said longfield too many children in the north are facing the double whammy of entrenched deprivation and poor schools they are being left behind we need to ask why a child from a lowincome family in london is three times more likely to go to university than a child who grows up in hartlepool,2018-03,child growing north deprived community face double whammy familial disadvantage poor institutional performance child area dropping education

the head of britains equality watchdog has warned companies that they could be pursued through the courts if they fail to report their gender pay gap issuing a stark warning to the companies that have yet to provide data on the difference between the amount they pay male and female employees rebecca hilsenrath chief executive of the equality and human rights commission said those that failed to make the deadline on april cant row back and would be named and shamed for the first time this year all companies and public bodies with more than employees are legally obliged to publish their gender pay gap their bonus pay gap and to reveal the proportion of men and women in each quartile of their business let me be very very clear failing to report is breaking the law hilsenrath said we have the powers to enforce against companies who are in breach of these regulations we take this enormously seriously we have been very clear that we will be coming after of companies that do not comply around companies have revealed their gender pay gap on the government equalities website but with only days before the cutoff around are yet to do so hilsenrath said of the companies that by law must report their gender pay gap before the deadline had yet to register to do so the ehrc will immediately write to companies that do not make the deadline those that continue to avoid the statutory requirement could ultimately face a summary conviction an unlimited fine and be forced to publish the data under a court order if that happens it will be the case that the company has been found to be in breach of the law and you wont be able to row back from the publicity of that fact once the deadline has past said hilsenrath asked whether companies would be named and shamed hilsenrath said there will be a list and this is will made public we will be conducting a statutory investigation and that requires us as a matter of law to publish the terms of reference so this is going to be very public and there wont be any way to hide the figures whether they are all published on the same day as other people it wont get you out of the problem a spokeswoman for the government equalities office said she could not confirm whether a list of companies that fail to make the deadline would be made public on the government portal hilsenrath said she was confident that the majority of companies would publish comparing the delay to the lastminute rush to file tax returns but when asked if she had a message for companies who had not yet filed she said its the law dont break it just like you wouldnt break any other law secondly i would say stop wasting your money talking to consultants who might be advising you about legal loopholes its an illinformed and illjudged gamble she added but above and beyond all of that i would say look at the women who work for you and ask yourself if they dont deserve a better deal there is a huge moral element to this we as a society know that there are legal and social implications for the fact that half the human race is responsible for giving birth for the continuation of the human race lots of the people running these organisations have daughters its not good enough the pay gap reporting requirement has already revealed significant discrepancies in the differences between the amount men and women get paid in industries from finance to beauty and shone a spotlight on how men dominate the highestearning senior roles in many companies in banking hsbcs median pay gap was and bonus gap barclays international revealed a pay gap and bonus gap while at goldman sachs the figures were and respectively at loral where of the workforce are female the figures were and with men holding of senior roles in education the guardians analysis of data has revealed that at a string of multiacademy trusts women face median hourly pay deficits of more than with the median gap above the national average in the majority of cases hilsenrath said the requirement was a really important endeavour which had revealed that the uk was not doing quite as well as we thought she said the government and companies had to focus on action to tackle the gender pay gap i think this is a very welcome light being shone on a problem that we know has existed for a very long time she said but i think the most important thing is how businesses react to those pay gaps how many of them take proper action to address them,2018-03,head britain equality watchdog ha warned company could pursued court fail report gender pay gap issuing stark warning company yet

vice the culture magazine and media empire made its name by publishing irreverent content on sex drugs and subcultures that rarely made the mainstream press it has continued that trend up until the present day with other publishers scrambling to keep up but since october when metoo upset the patriarchal balance by careering through dozens of industries in a hurricanelike whirl the vice empire has also been under scrutiny settling four claims of sexual harassment or defamation and receiving dozens more allegations including from the documentary maker billie jd porter for many years jd porter was a vice star a precocious prodigious on and offscreen talent but in an instagram post in january she claimed she had been given drugs and alcohol in the vice uk offices as a yearold and asked to perform sex acts on one of her male bosses her vice business cards even read lolita life ruiner in an interview last week with channel news she made the point that for her the aftermath of the incidents of inappropriate behaviour has actually been worse than the incidents themselves its been painful for both men and women to look back at their past and realise that certain situations were much darker than how they appeared at the time she said the depths of her feelings were further revealed in an earlier article in saying out loud the multiple ways i was taken advantage of by men twice my age who i trusted completely the abuse has become a lot more real and triggered a huge amount of stress and anxiety in me ive seen how the hr processes work or do not work at similarly edgy publications when something is amiss as i tweeted during the height of the metoo movement i was once asked to do a topless photoshoot as an intern at a magazine which i reported to hr on leaving and didnt hear anything back on so i empathise with jd porter when she sets out her allegations and distress about how she feels vice has failed to handle its investigation with any tact metoo has revealed how many women have been exposed to the insensitive way victims are treated although as the metoo founder tarana burke said in an interview with the guardian we need a shift in culture so that every single instance of sexual harassment is investigated and dealt with whats more across the board it seems that the processes in these investigations desperately need to change apart from anything else a key consideration should be just how awful it can be to force yourself to recognise a situation in which you have been wronged meanwhile we should no longer be surprised if we ever

knifecrime injuries are on the rise because people are being stabbed more often its not much of an explanation any police chief would be ridiculed for it it certainly doesnt justify the rise or point towards possible solutions it basically restates the issue in a slightly different way yet when it comes to gender pay gaps exposed by new requirements to publish the difference between average male and female hourly rates employers are giving us just this kind of response the reason for the hefty divides they say is that senior roles are dominated by men that does not explain the problem that is the problem they are not recruiting or promoting women to top jobs and in many cases are relying on them to do the lowestpaid work if employers were in genuine ignorance as to how they treated their workers these figures were an opportunity to educate themselves instead many seem in denial several bleat that they pay men and women the same for equivalent work this has been the law for almost years though its still not met in full its like expecting praise for paying their tax or filing yearly accounts in fairness these firms are doing better than most just by revealing their gaps organisations with more than employees must publish the information annually but twothirds have yet to do so with the first deadline less than a fortnight away they include many ftse companies perhaps they dont see it as important perhaps they hope their results will go unnoticed among all the lastminute filings perhaps they dont plan to file the figures at all executives are worrying the numbers look bad im afraid its worse than that chaps they are bad and the attempts to account for them are pretty terrible too company statements provide compelling evidence of a new law of physics call it eves principle the greater the pay gap the greater the mental resistance so the british heart foundation which slightly favours women in median terms sets out a plan to reduce its mean gap of the university of cambridge where the median gap is still below the national average of says it is not closing the divide fast enough and needs to do more now compare with phase eight a womenswear firm of all things where the men among its employees are so heavily concentrated at the top that the mean gap stands at and median at while on first glance our published gender pay gap figures suggest the average man has a higher hourly rate of pay than the average female this is misleading and does not reflect the true story and culture within the phase eight business says the ceo the pay gap figures do not suggest this they prove it however many times you look if that doesnt truly reflect phase eights culture maybe it should do more to close the divide implicit in explaining away these findings is the idea that this is all societys fault as if society is not composed of individuals and institutions making choices every day and as if wild variations across the same sectors are born of the unique unshiftable requirements of one particular firm that surely cant explain how easyjet and tui have median gaps of more than but british airways only around social change will be part of the solution supporting fathers better including through improved paternal leave rights would allow more women to take a step up in the workplace but there are plenty of things that companies can do by themselves and some of them are already doing so the easyjet and tui pay gaps exist in large part because almost all their pilots are male but tui where only of pilots are female makes vague promises

young women helping to shift bosses attitudes while youre at it ask yourself if your top staff should be earning so much and other workers so little in many cases the gender pay gap reflects the absurd and unhealthy gulf that has opened up between those at the top and bottom of companies none of these is a solution in itself all of them would help they should not be beyond the wit of all

mps are to investigate the difference in average pay for men and women amid fears the governments new scheme to highlight the gender pay gap is not telling the true story executive pay and bonuses will also come under the spotlight in a business energy and industrial strategy beis select committee investigation which kicks off next month the hearings will come nearly a fortnight after the final

report on the difference in the average pay for all male and female employees by april however less than of the expected total had reported by friday airlines banks and oil companies have reported some of the worst pay gaps so far as men dominate the bestpaid roles but many companies are holding back on reporting their gender pay gap until the last minute rachel reeves the chair of the beis select committee said transparency on gender pay is only the beginning we need to examine why these pay gaps persist why within the same sector there may be companies with wildly differing paygaps and what remedies are needed to tackle them she said excessive executive pay was at root an issue of fairness she said the committee would also look at whether the new reporting scheme was properly capturing the salaries of staff and what steps companies were taking to address the pay gap pay awards for top bosses which vastly outstrip worker pay and which owe little to building genuine longterm value in a company are impossible to justify and damage the social contract between business and the public unjustified executive pay awards are the most corrosive influence on public trust in business and businesses must face up to their responsibilities and tackle this problem if businesses dont step up on executive pay government will need to step in companies which do not report by

millions of pounds have been cut from council spending on refuges for vulnerable women and children figures obtained by the guardian reveal a majority of local authorities across england wales and scotland have slashed funding in real terms for refuges since according to the data of the authorities that responded to the guardians request for information or had cut funding in real terms since amounting to an average fall for each of or m in total in the months to march spending on refuges fell by an average of per authority or nearly m in total with authorities cutting spending in real terms according to the figures obtained under the freedom of information act the fall in financial support comes at a time when the government is planning to remove refuges and other forms of shortterm supported housing from the welfare system instead of using housing benefit to fund refuges the government is proposing to give a ringfenced grant to councils for shortterm supported housing however this does not exclusively cover refuges it is also aimed at homeless people exoffenders and drug addicts there were refuge services operating in england and wales in commenting on the guardians findings katie ghose the chief executive of womens aid said it was clear that a local funding approach with no national accountability was not working and called on the government to give a castiron guarantee that its proposed changes to funding would be dropped in recent years domestic abuse services have been lurching from funding crisis to funding crisis with many refuges closing changing hands reducing refuge spaces or paring back on the level of support they can provide this is a result of local commissioning practice and a reduction in local authority budgets she said as local governments have seen their budgets squeezed there has been a push to commission generic onesizefitsall bed spaces at lower cost but without the security support and expertise of lifesaving refuge places a refuge is more than just a bed for the night it is a lifeline for thousands of women and children fleeing domestic abuse she added our network of lifesaving refuges have been forced to provide more for less doing extraordinary work on uncertain and shortterm shoestring budgets however the governments planned changes to the way that refuges will be funded will be the breaking point the governments plans will remove refuges last secure form of funding housing benefit and devolve housing costs to local authorities to fund services that meet the needs of their local areas but this is an inappropriate local response to what is a national problem over twothirds of women escape to a refuge outside of their local area for fear that they will be hunted down by the perpetrator while one in of all domestic abuse services currently do not receive any local authority funding we are calling on the government to give survivors a castiron guarantee that their dangerous planned changes to how refuges will be funded are firmly off the table and that refuges will be protected so that every woman and child can safely escape domestic abuse within the figures all of the london boroughs that responded have seen funding fall since of those only two have increased funding in the months to march this year among the authorities experiencing the biggest falls in funding since is lancashire county council where spending on refuges has been cut by although it received a oneoff central government grant in the year to march wolverhampton city council has cut funding by lambeth by derby city by and bradford by among those seeing the the biggest increases since are bristol city council which raised spending by essex county council by fife council by north yorkshire by and hartlepool council by the government recently put proposals for a landmark domestic abuse bill out for consultation they include plans for a civil protection order that would see domestic abuse suspects face electronic tagging to monitor their movements but the bill risks being overshadowed by the funding crisis faced by womens refuges more than women and children fleeing domestic abuse will be unable to access a refuge if the government rolls out the proposal to remove them from the welfare system womens aid said a survey by the charity found of refuges said they would have to close for good if they lost the funding while a further said they would be forced to reduce the number of bed spaces in the year to march about million women in england and wales experienced domestic abuse

companies are holding back on reporting their gender pay gap until the last minute because they are fearful of losing female talent as the difference between male and female employees is exposed experts say with just two weeks to go until the government deadline less than a third of the companies required to report their gender pay gap have done so all companies with more than employees have to report their gender pay gap bonus pay gap and the proportion of male and female employees in each quartile of their business by april public employers such as universities hospital trusts councils and government departments have until march so far of the ftse have reported which while better than the overall figure will cast doubt on public commitments to diversify the workforce lots are waiting to publish their gender pay gaps they have looked at the coverage of companies who have reported early and they havent liked what they have seen said mark crail content director at xperthr crail said that with just two weeks to go he was still being contacted by firms who had not yet started the process others had reported figures that were clearly wrong such as reporting pay gaps over or stating a pay and bonus gap or had had figures signed off by people who were not directors contrary to the reporting rules he said around of organisations had reported by lunchtime on wednesday if companies have reported by the th of april i would be absolutely astonished he said another gender pay gap expert working closely as an advisor to several companies put it more bluntly companies are absolutely shitting themselves about how their employees are going to react they are worried that senior women might just leave and it will be more difficult to recruit women there is this hide in the herd mentality because they know the media is all over it of the companies that have reported some have been criticised for the way they have presented their findings this week law firm slaughter and may reported a median pay gap of while men were paid more than more in bonuses but the firms press release stated that excluding secretaries from the figures resulted in a dramatic change from the statutory figures and showed that female associates were paid on par with male others have been criticised for the scale of the gulf between the pay of men and women investment bank goldman sachs international where only of top earners are women admitted it had significant work to do after revealing that it pays women less than men on average a gap which increases to for bonus pay it was in companies interest to be clear and transparent about reporting the gap in a timely fashion said gender pay gap expert helene reardon bond a former senior civil servant who played a key role in shaping the requirement this is the opportunity they have to communicate to their staff what the issues are and how they are going to address them she said for many companies this is the first time senior company figures often men are sitting down and really looking at this stuff and figuring out what they can do about it karen gill cofounder of everywoman which aims to advance women in business said delays in reporting were also a measure of how seriously businesses were taking the requirement i think the data has made a lot of leadership teams realise they do have an issue and what is really exciting is that they are now able to pinpoint exactly where in their business they have to focus she said real transparency is being created and those companies that dont take it seriously will get dragged along if companies do not report by midnight on april they will face sanctions administered by the equality and human rights commission the ehrc will write to all noncompliant companies giving them days to comment before starting an investigation and writing an initial report companies will then be given days to make representations before a final report is published ultimately they can

with only a fortnight left before the deadline not even a third of companies charities and public bodies have met their legal requirement to publish figures on their gender pay gaps there was plenty of notice that all with more than employees would need to do so the slow pace indicates the low priority afforded to such concerns and perhaps a hope that embarrassing figures will be buried in a late rush of filings it seems probable that many organisations will not comply and it is unclear whether and how they will be punished they should be the figures are not perfect the refusal of law firms to include the earnings of mostly male partners for example produces technically accurate but misleading results nonetheless the data published so far is powerful few if any women will be surprised that male colleagues outearn them per hour but cold statistics have real force when they show disparities as stark as these men at the uk wing of goldman sachs international earn more than twice the mean hourly pay of women the impact is potentially reminiscent of metoo if so far more muted such figures demonstrate to each woman that the problem is not an isolated case but structural they are not alone now they can prove it the journey from the equal pay act to the equalities act represented a shift from the idea that individuals had a right to not be discriminated against to the idea that the country should and would tackle discrimination so while the figures may be helpful to women in lobbying for change allowing them to show that comparable businesses have very different outcomes it is up to their employers and their representatives to take action but will they so far many firms have boasted that they are committed to diversity not committed enough evidently and that they pay the same for the same kind of work this is not deserving of a gold star equal pay is a legal requirement in place for almost half a century the shame is that it is not in fact being met in full worse many companies particularly those with striking pay gaps such as fashion retailer phase eight and travel group tui seem to have missed the point they say in essence that the gap exists because the senior jobs are dominated by men this is not an explanation of the problem it is the problem itself the pattern of more women in lowpaid jobs and fewer in highpaid jobs is seen in most organisations across very different sectors and it is why the figures showing employment rates per quartile are every bit as important as the hourly comparison the guardian has an mean hourly pay gap this is lower than the current office for national statistics average but it is not good enough and the aim is to reduce it further and to achieve gender balance in the top half of the organisation within five years some women may simply leave organisations that do not reward them good for them bad for the companies losing talent unnecessarily but will their bosses realise this the time for excuses and explanations is over real progress requires a broader response with management unions and politicians putting forward concrete plans to change the culture through measures such as blind cvs and unconsciousbias training and setting specific numerical stretch targets the equalities watchdog should call out those who do not report and those whose figures are woeful as well as offering breakdowns by region and sector much of the gap reflects an enduring tendency to discriminate on the basis of hours worked and assume that top jobs can only performed in one way by one person working full time rarely possible if they have significant care commitments mps on the women and equalities select committee argue that increasing male involvement in family life including through an extension of paid ringfenced paternity leave will be key the duty to report these figures is an annual one there is a risk that their effect may dwindle in the years to come but close analysis and

britain must radically reform parental leave to encourage more fathers to take time off work or it will never get to grips with the gender pay gap an influential committee of mps has recommended fathers should get the option of weeks paid use it or lose it paternity leave to try and encourage greater male involvement in the young lives of children the women and equalities select committee reports on tuesday the government should also legislate to force businesses to offer men flexible patterns such as parttime work or unusual hours because many fathers complain that bosses do not understand their need to juggle work and family life parental leave and the gender pay gap are closely linked the committee chair maria miller told the guardian until we get it right for dads we cant get it right for mums the committee launched its inquiry last year in response to surveys and studies that showed many men still felt financially professionally and culturally unable to take time off or downshift during the crunch early years of their childrens lives in particular men said it was hard to persuade employers to take their request for leave seriously and expressed concerns about being sidelined if they asked for flexible working patterns as a result the numbers of fathers able to take time off caring for their families and encouraging their wives to get back into work remains small three years ago the government introduced shared parental leave which gave couples the option of splitting weeks of leave entitlement and weeks of pay but takeup is thought to be a low as instead the committee says the uk should follow the swedish example of ringfencing paternity leave which couples would lose if the father does not take it up there should be protected dad leave because that is the most effective way of getting dads to take time off and not just when their little ones are born miller said miller said it was crucial that the week leave period should be available to men of all incomes many men in lower income groups have said they could not afford to take leave at the rate of statutory maternity pay the committee report recommends paternity pay should be set at of the fathers pay and capped for higher earners the committee also wants the government to introduce a law to ensure that jobs are advertised as flexible from day one unless there are proper business reasons not to what all parents want is more flexible working miller said business listens to the law we are still in a situation where dads overwhelmingly feel they will be badly thought of for taking shared parental leave it is seen as a lack of commitment to the job sarah jackson chief executive of working families the uks work life balance charity said properly paid paternity leave would send a strong signal from government about the importance of the role of fathers in a childs early years she added efforts to enable father involvement will fail if upon their return to work fathers cannot work parttime or flexibly because those jobs simply arent available and their workplace culture is hostile to their ambition to share care of their children andrew hammerton a father of two who works in marketing said it was only the combination of a generous understanding employer a wife keen to get back to work and his own determination that made it possible to take six months out last year when his second daughter was born i needed the stars to align or it wouldnt have been possible he said i had legitimate support from my workplace theres a level of

a few months ago we welcomed into our home at a few hours notice two children under the age of five who had been removed from their family under an interim care order in our mids and with our four children largely grown we decided to become foster carers and had undergone six months of exhaustive checks and training there is currently a need for around foster places but not enough carers to provide homes for vulnerable children at risk improving the status of foster carers is central to addressing this shortage theres no contract between foster carers and a local authority instead an agreement is signed which establishes a fee and expenses my partner and i get just over a week carers have no employment rights and do not enjoy even worker status under eu law there is no legally mandated sickness or holiday pay or entitlement to the minimum wage my partner and i are not poor and so money does not matter too much but for those who rely on placements for income such guarantees are vital carers are carefully monitored have to keep meticulous records and enjoy little natural or spontaneous authority in catering for a childs needs parental authority at least initially remains with the natural parents and the local authority sleepovers haircuts nonemergency medical treatment and schooling have to be cleared with social workers caring for children who have experienced terrible things is not easy it involves coping with tears and tantrums confusion disordered behaviour violence and the everpresent possibility of a false allegation being made even relatively easy placements import a weight of tragedy into the home that leaves little room for routine and unrelated stresses you are on hour watch in too many cases carers can still be treated as junior employees rather than as partners and the volunteers they currently are no one gets rich through fostering the task is so allconsuming and the remuneration so limited that altruism has to be the primary motivation there is thus little danger of a prospective carer seeing fostering as a nice little earner one woman i know who lives alone and who once found herself fleeing her home when set upon by one of her charges has no other income if she fails to secure placements or gets ill or suffers bereavement or family disaster she is on her own and her expertise and above all the love and security she provides is lost the recent media outrage surrounding a christian child being placed with a muslim foster family in tower hamlets shows how underappreciated the role can be the sacrifice and service of this particular foster family who opened their home to a desperate child was reduced to a medieval discussion about cultural and religious compatibility how awful for them and the child and how offputting for prospective carers we work directly with the local authority rather than through an independent fostering agency many agencies are run for profit and their placements tend to be more expensive might not the inflated amounts paid to agencies be better spent in a more efficient and reformed inhouse operation above all some sort of national definition of the rights and remuneration due to foster carers needs to be established a universal pay scale should be applied and foster carers should be given a legally recognised status there are already attempts in the courts to secure employment rights guaranteeing a measure of financial and legal security we went into fostering because we felt it was our duty given our advantages and life stage it would have been wrong to walk away once we knew the facts for those with good hearts and lesser means and for those who rely on fostering as a key source of income some protection against instant and sometimes unexplained

hello and welcome to the guardians weekly roundup of whats new this week in the world of gender pay gap reporting there were muted celebrations this week as the number of uk companies reporting pay differences between their male and female employees exceeded data is coming in thick and fast with more than companies reporting in the past week that still leaves about companies which are yet to report as a reminder all public and private sector organisations in britain with or more employees must report their gender pay gap the difference between what they pay men and women by april as of the evening of tuesday march organisations had reported of that number said mens median pay was higher than that of their female colleagues said women were paid more and said there was no gap between the sexes what we learned this week the guardian on wednesday released its gender pay gap figures which show a median hourly pay gap of and a mean gap of when the gnm figures are broken down between

elizabeth doesnt dare tell social services but there have been nights when she and her three kids couldnt eat no heating no gas weve lived like paupers she told me he doesnt pay any maintenance even though legally hes meant to so sometimes i cant pay my nursery bill that means that even though ive left him my jobs at risk i cant take a child into work her expartner has also sent emails to letting agents impugning her ability to afford the rent meaning shes had to stump up six months in advance to keep hold of a tenancy elizabeth not her real name didnt have that money shes had to borrow from friends despite paying her rent on time subsequent damning emails from her ex to letting agents have she believes led to her and the children being evicted twice he has also repeatedly maligned elizabeths character to her employers shes just warned her new boss to expect a coruscating email from to land in his inbox hes spoken to a wide range of people to destroy my reputation which i cant action and i cant repair she says despairingly he continues to thwart my ability to rent or own a property to work to qualify shes retraining so hes completely stifling me economically four years after leaving him im as controlled by him as i always was what elizabeth is describing is now defined by domestic violence campaigners as economic abuse a vicious and deliberate pattern of behaviour that destroys any hope of a secure future for victims and their children thanks to lobbying by the charity surviving economic abuse it has just been named for the first time in the governments domestic violence bill and not a moment too soon economic abuse could soon be made a crime in its own right and be included as part of a statutory definition of domestic abuse which would make it far easier to prosecute under coercive and controlling behaviour legislation this is still a very new offence but research by surviving economic abuse found that between december to march convictions for coercive and controlling behaviour were reported in the press in of those cases victims were described as having been subjected to various forms of economic abuse perpetrators had undermined their ability to earn money five made their partner leave their job and one threatened to get the victim sacked or alternatively to maintain their standard of living this might include spending money a victim had set aside for bills destroying their property or using coercion or fraud to build up debts in a partners name one woman ended up in debt another perpetrator emptied joint bank accounts thousands of pounds were borrowed from a third victim phones were smashed some women had their clothes burned or thrown away costing them money to replace wider family was not immune there were threats and damage to property belonging to one victims parents in every case it was men abusing womens ability to live a financially secure and independent life and it turns out youre never too old or too young to be economically abused with the victims ranging from to it happened in relationships as short as a couple of months and in some that had endured for many years the layers of financial manipulation that typically characterise economic abuse make it difficult for police to investigate and proving elizabeths case has it seems been too hard for the state to follow through though the police built a case and recommended that her former partner be charged the crown prosecution service refused too complex and too little chance of a conviction she was told clearly these are not going to be simple cases to bring to court its not a fractured eye socket or a punctured lung its not a shouting match neighbours can hear and give evidence on how do police prove a victim has been deliberately prevented from going to work how do you show that the gas money has been spent month after month how do you demonstrate to a jury that a victim has been coerced into taking on annihilating levels of debt but we wouldnt accept a failure to prosecute for other serious crimes just because the prime suspect has done a great job of covering up more forensic financial expertise is needed fast in police investigating teams and there must be more commitment and determination from the cps it cannot be that the more complex subtle and devious the abuse the less likely an alleged offender is to come before the law its worth remembering too that there can be wider ramifications to a decision not to prosecute the judges in the family court have not accepted that this is a domestic abuse case elizabeth told me they have accepted everything my ex said because hes a lawyer and because the police and cps hadnt charged as a lawyer my ex knows how to manipulate the courts the legal system the child maintenance service so this is the reality me and the kids sleeping in two beds at my friends and hes in our old home which i jointly owned thats worth well over a million elizabeth now thinks that because she is unable to financially provide for them she might lose her children if i dont get housing soon i think theyll be transferred to him she told me bleakly wheres the justice in that and if elizabeths ex ever were to be convicted and jailed for economic abuse where would that get her shes still beyond skint she and her kids are still sofa surfing and her professional standing has been trashed surviving economic abuse wants victims of this type of abuse to be financially compensated but if the perpetrator has assets why should the state cough up surely instead it would be justice for a court to forensically assess a victims losses and then squeeze their abusers bank accounts until theyre dry louise tickle is a freelance journalist,2018-03,elizabeth

from hollywood stars demanding equal pay to the bbc cutting male journalists salaries the gender pay gap has featured prominently in the news in recent months we have all heard the typical explanations for it women have babies women do more housework they dont negotiate they opt out of the workforce many studies have tried to explain why men are paid more the first set of explanations explain these pay discrepancies through individual differences they argue that womens pay is lower because they have fewer years of education or they are not studying the right topics or because they have fewer years of training and onthejob experience this is mostly explained through work interruptions due to parental leave childcare duties and unequal distributions of housework the second set of explanations focus on occupational differences and argue that men and women work in different jobs and sectors women are concentrated in positions with less money less authority and less autonomy when a job becomes a womans job overall pay for the job declines to make things worse women also face a motherhood penalty where mothers are paid less than their nonmother counterparts even though these explanations look very different almost every study on the pay gap has one thing in common they all focus on adult workers however according to the department of labors report on the youth labor force many teenagers work parttime while still in school and work starts as early as therefore the work experience and potentially the pay inequality starts long before the completion of formal education and the start of real jobs in my new book on the pay gap the cost of being a girl working teens and the origins of the gender wage gap i focus on this substantial yet often neglected part of our economy tween and teenage workers focusing on younger workers is like a social laboratory many commonsense explanations used to dismiss discrimination claims are simply not applicable most yearolds are not married they dont have children and to yearolds also have the same education and same skills using data from the national longitudinal study of youth when you look at and yearolds they have no gender inequality in pay however when they reach and we see the emergence of the first wage gap some individual factors matter the gap is wider with age also race matters african american girls and young women experience a wider gap types of jobs also matter boys and girls start out in freelance jobs babysitting snow removal and yard work but as more employeetype jobs become available boys move into them and girls stay longer in freelance jobs the rest is the cost of being a girl even within freelance jobs male babysitters are paid more than their female counterparts babysitting girls have more unpaid hours do more extra chores and have lower pay male babysitters tend to have few unpaid hours are not asked to run errands and are more likely to be asked how much they charge when girls ask for more money they are less likely to get it than boys within service and retail jobs things are not much better for girls it may look like girls are doing similar jobs to boys but they are more likely to be asked to deal with challenging customers and more likely to be asked to get in debt to fit the brands image when they ask for more money they are more likely to be told youre here for the discounts overall the pay gap starts much earlier than previously reported our commonsense explanations and trusted theories fail us because they fail to explain pay inequality among very young workers if we want to solve this persistent problem we need to better identify the origins and the mechanisms through which these early gender differences are created and reinforced yasemin

labour has pushed the government into agreeing to a sixmonth extension of the workplace childcare voucher system after using a parliamentary procedure to force a vote on a series of changes that ministers had hoped to put in place by directive however as expected the government won a vote on a parallel opposition motion that would have halted the imposition of an earnings threshold for free school meals the delay on the abolition of childcare vouchers which labour whips were predicting could lead to the policy being abandoned altogether is another example of the party using commons tactics to frustrate the government the vouchers policy along with the free school meals changes and plans to amend free childcare for twoyearolds were part of changes connected to the rollout of universal credit uc being passed via statutory instrument which does not require a commons vote but labour secured a threehour debate on the changes using a socalled humble address in which mps can pray against proposals at the end of the debate damian hinds the education secretary vigorously defended the policies but in response to an intervention by the dup mp emma pengelly he said the childcare voucher abolition was being delayed i have heard the concerns raised about this and about the timing and i can confirm we will be able to keep the voucher scheme open for a further six months to new entrants following representations that she has made the employerbacked vouchers are being replaced by a new system of taxfree childcare but labour claims the system is poorly understood and its rollout has been botched hinds said he would not back down on the free school meals threshold currently all families in england in receipt of uc are entitled to free school meals as a transitional measure while the new benefit is extended across the country but the government now plans to set an income threshold of childrens charities have said this will create a cliffedge as earnings rise the childrens society claims that once a family with one child passes the threshold they would need to earn a year more to make up for the loss in free school meals no child receiving free meals now or you gained them during the rollout of universal credit will lose their entitlement during that rollout even if family earnings rise above the threshold hinds assured mps introducing the debate the shadow education secretary angela rayner said if the house does not vote for our motions today over a million families will lose out she referred to philip hammonds cautious optimism about the economy and public spending in his spring statement earlier in the day saying so much for that light at the end of the tunnel the chancellor mentioned labour lost four votes on the statutory

katie ghose the chief executive of womens aid knows she has a fight on her hands to ensure the domestic violence bill announced last week by theresa may is worth the paper its written on with refuges under dire threat from changes to funding ghose says the proposals must go beyond criminal justice if they are going to make a difference we definitely want this bill to be a springboard for every part of government to make domestic abuse and the wider violence against women agenda front and centre and to ultimately tackle the root causes to prevent it happening in the future says ghose to do that it must encompass all areas of public policy that touch a survivors life such as health housing and education the draft bill includes more support for victims in court tougher sentences in cases where children are involved the creation of an independent domestic abuse commissioner and putting into law the scheme where police can disclose information about previous violent offending domestic abuse protection orders dapos would also allow police and courts to intervene earlier where abuse is suspected the latter part of the bill has already raised eyebrows as suspects could be electronically tagged despite not yet being convicted of a crime which some commentators have said could breach their civil rights in response ghose says the problem we have at the moment is that there is not enough focus on the victims and police just do not have enough tools in their box to keep women safe and to tackle the perpetrators diplomatically she adds obviously well need to look at all the details of the specific measures proposed they have to add up to a package of measures to ensure the police can offer the right response others including the campaign group sisters uncut who described the bill as a dangerous distraction have pointed out that refuges are facing a major crisis that the bill doesnt fully address separate proposals by the ministry of housing communities and local government would see refuges and other forms of shortterm supported housing removed from the welfare system this would prevent those fleeing abusive partners from using their housing benefit to pay for refuge stays on average housing benefit which is currently the final guaranteed source of income available to refuges makes up of their funding ghose who has been in post since july says refuges are right to be concerned and has been horrified by the postcode lottery shes seen in action while travelling around the country she says that mays mention of sustainable funding for refuges in her international womens day speech was welcome but that the government must take the proposed housing benefit changes off the table these risky proposals are coming on top of already very shaky foundations this comes on top of years of cuts that have led many refuges to close their doors or operate on a shoestring another reason the changes are so risky is that the government is proposing a completely local approach to a service that has to be national for survivors to be safe twothirds of women flee their local area to get away from an abusive family member she says local councils are going to really struggle with a purely local approach they are not going to have the incentives to do the right thing and make sure that the services are there for every survivor that needs them she believes that the creation of a domestic abuse commissioner could be key if they have enough powers this needs to be a commissioner with robust powers and resources to hold government and other agencies nationally regionally and locally to account and to have the teeth and the strength to call out patchy or poor practice and actually have something done about it ghose has campaigning in her blood her first taste was as a small child when she helped her mother lead a fight against a road being built nearby a visit to greenham common followed but it was the racism she faced in the s and s she was raised in sussex by an indian father and a white british mother both of whom she says are feminists that left her with a raging sense of injustice and a passion for ensuring the quieter voices in society are heard a former barrister she feels that she brings all the legal and campaigning experience she has gained from different fields including electoral reform and human rights to womens aid to puts its ambitions into practice and hold the government to account i know what the inside of a courtroom looks and feels like i know how you gather the insights of experts by experience which is very relevant to how you gather survivors stories which are crucial ghose feels real change is coming this is a momentous time and we also have the metoo and times up movements its in this climate

last month a dozen members of our feminist direct action group stormed the red carpet at the baftas chanting in solidarity with the times up movement the dv bills a coverup theresa may your time is up we did so to shed light on the inherent dangers lurking in the governments upcoming domestic violence and abuse bill which we knew would be a dangerous distraction from the real state of the domestic violence sector in the uk on international womens day the government confirmed our expectations when it laid out more clearly its proposals for this bill again we see smokescreens diverting attention away from what this bill will mean more survivors being locked up by a harmful criminal justice system while still locked out of refuges and locked into violent situations despite a stated aim to challenge and change the attitudes that can underpin domestic abuse the underlying motivation of this bill is clear to put yet more power in the hands of the police courts and criminal justice system although the government argues this tough approach will better shield victims we know that the police and prisons are no solution to domestic violence in fact similar policies to those in this bill have in the us led to an increase in the number of survivors being arrested especially black minority ethnic and disadvantaged survivors the police and courts have plenty of resources and power giving them more wont address the reasons they are failing if the government truly wants to tackle domestic violence power should be given back to survivors by properly funding sorelyneeded specialist services and refuges the governments purported commitment to develop a sustainable funding model for refuges only masks their devastating legacy of funding cuts and piecemeal offerings in of women who approached a refuge for help were turned away providing context to theresa mays claim elsewhere that the best available data shows bed spaces have increased by since in fact this figure not only should represent a cut in real terms when taking into account the reported increase in demand as well as population growth but also cannot count for those survivors turned away for lack of funding local authorities refuge funding has fallen by an average of in the same timeframe meaning many survivors especially those with specialist support needs are left with nowhere to go as survivors and sector workers we know a prosentence environment isnt the answer to domestic violence the government proposes a statutory aggravating factor in sentencing similar to those already in law for hate crimes for domestic abuse to toughen sentences when youre a survivor in danger there is little difference between your perpetrator getting a threeweek sentence or an week sentence if you cant get safe housing when they are released it also plays into a dangerous rhetoric prioritising the criminal justice system over support and services in the community the government has pledged m that will be dedicated to supporting female offenders who have been victims as over have indicated they have experienced domestic abuse but thats a drop in the ocean next to the bn to be invested in modern prison places by and the m spent on immigration removal centre over four years we know that when women suffer violence its the private companies that profit sisters uncut is not alone in criticising of this bill in october a wide range of womens organisations wrote to the home secretary amber rudd and the justice secretary david lidington appealing to them to go further with the domestic violence and abuse bill and last week the end violence against women coalition reaffirmed the need for radical change at sisters uncut we stand with these other organisations in demanding that the government stop forcing through legislation based on ideology and austerity and start basing it on what survivors actually want and need we demand and we deserve a domestic violence and abuse bill that funds refuges and specialist domestic violence services rather than focusing on a criminal justice system that only further harms survivors for more information on the consultation please follow this link sisters

we never hear politicians or pundits arguing that men should be paid more than women yet this reality is fundamental to the organisation of our society the mean gender pay gap for fulltime work runs at rising to if parttime work is included and these pay gaps are just one aspect of the unequal division of wealth between the sexes women in britain continue to undertake a greater share of unpaid caring duties within families and are therefore more likely to work parttime or to not work at all for these reasons womens share of the nations wage bill is even less than is implied by the pay gap if we do not acknowledge the gendered nature of financial inequality in modern britain we cannot hope to change it a historical perspective offers valuable insight into why unequal pay so resolutely persists and its a custom that goes back a long way in the bible the lord tells moses to place the value of female servants at threefifths that of male servants papyrus from roman egypt reveals both a genderspecific division of labour and much lower rates of pay for womens work setting womens work at a lower value than mens is not simply a characteristic of our own society it has occurred in all human societies for which records exist we encounter many different explanations for the ongoing gender pay gap women work parttime they take career breaks for family reasons their work is low skilled they work in the caring professions they are underrepresented in science and engineering but these commonly cited explanations assume that pay is set according to the value of the work done in a straightforward and linear way when we look at how mens and womens labour has been rewarded in the past we are forced to drop that comforting assumption for hundreds of years virtually all work has been segregated by gender and men have always been paid more occasionally men did physically demanding work which might command a wage premium but for the most part their jobs did not call for special skills or strength that only men possess why did men weave and women spin and anyway who is to say which task required the greater skill if men are suited to heavy work why was laundry work always womens work given its physical demands why was driving a tram mans job when the tram drivers left to fight the first world war it quickly became apparent there was nothing in the work that women could not do in truth there was rarely anything innate to the work itself that made some jobs male and others female it was custom and tradition that determined who did what mens jobs were paid at a higher rate because men did them and men were responsible for maintaining their families not because the job in question was inherently more valuable meanwhile low female pay made it very difficult for a woman to live independently it forced her into a position of dependency on first her father and later her husband these customs were consolidated with the industrial revolution whereas most work in preindustrial england was carried on inside the home the mechanisation of work involved the construction of large expensive machinery and mills and factories to house them as a result paid work started to move outside the home and this created much sharper divisions between housework and work between unpaid domestic work by women and paid employment undertaken by men outside the home yet the perception that womens work was less valuable than mens was carried forward into this new world indeed it was given a new lease of life according to the victorians women were naturally inclined towards motherhood and home while men were naturally destined to govern conquer and work and low female wages were not simply an expression of this worldview they also helped to create it high wages in the factory districts had initially caused women to abandon the home for the mills low wages were vital in ensuring that women remained in the home performing the necessary tasks of the household fetching water making fires shopping cooking childrearing and cleaning low pay was not simply a convenience for employers it also played a critical role in ensuring mens continued dominance over women in all spheres of life the burden of housework has eased over the past century with ever smaller families and modern appliances but all homes and particularly those with children still require some domestic labour we can pay for childminders and cleaners to do this labour or we can do it ourselves for free but it does need to be done for centuries high male wages and lower female wages have formed a central plank in ensuring that every household has some female labour available for cooking childcare and cleaning todays gender pay gap plays an important role in maintaining the status quo it is little surprise then that the equal pay act of has struggled to usher in a new world in which men and women earn equal pay a historical perspective allows us to see that pay is connected to much deeper questions about paid and unpaid work it is only by grasping the true extent and deep historical roots of unequal pay that we might take meaningful steps to address it emma griffin is professor

as the cabinet leads for childrens services in the northwest of england we are urging the chancellor to allocate the additional funds we need to address the growing crisis in childrens social care the demand and complexity of cases is increasing creating overspends in our childrens services budgets at the same time that our council budgets are being reduced this is an unsustainable financial demand for each of our councils in the northwest there are now more than lookedafter children this represents a year high and is the greatest number of children in care of any region in england this has been driven by growth of since alone double the increase in the rest of the country analysis from the placements northwest census identifies sharp escalation in costs for example a m increase in expenditure on residential care placements this year we have recorded referrals in which is an increase of on the previous year our data suggests that this is being driven by the increase in domestic abuse and mental ill health we know that the sustainable solution to reducing childrens social care is early intervention but the increasing cost of childrens social care is driving our limited resources away from funding early help this is consistent with the national picture that is illustrated in the turning the tide report produced by action for children national childrens bureau and the childrens society as the finance bill makes its way through parliament we are asking the government to respond to the crisis of childrens social care and provide adequate funding to meet these needs

this year marks the th anniversary of the sewing machinists strike at fords dagenham plant in women left the production line to protest against the fact that they were paid less than their male counterparts doing similar work bringing car production grinding to a halt their strike eventually led to the equal pay act landmark legislation that enshrined the right to equal pay for equal work described by its architect barbara castle as selfevidently just and right it has now been illegal for employers to pay differently for work of equivalent value for years but the gender pay gap remains intractable new figures last week showed that there are almost four times as many men who earn over a year than there are women threefifths of the low paid are women they still earn on average only p for every pound earned by men and at the current rate of progress it will take decades to close the gap a toxic mix of factors is responsible including outright discrimination the fact that women still carry most responsibility for caring and the overrepresentation of women in lowerpaid sectors this has allowed gender reactionaries to cherrypick data to argue that the gender pay gap is simply a product of womens choices they opt to do more caring within families they choose not to go into the highestpaying careers such as engineering and finance this is disingenuous rubbish first the statistics show that outright discrimination remains a stubborn presence in workplaces across britain the pay gap between men and women without children remains far from insignificant at experiments show that employers judge men and women differently with female job applicants regarded as less competent and deserving of lower pay some of this discrimination is conscious some will be implicit research suggests that the majority of us harbour sexist instincts that we unthinkingly act upon men are more likely to ask for a pay rise than women but women who do so are regarded negatively the weight of societal expectation is that it falls to women to fulfil caring roles some may happily choose to take a step back from their career for their families but many will feel they have no choice that it falls to them to juggle the responsibilities of working and family life or it wont happen at all not only do we still as a society expect women to pick up caring responsibilities but womens careers get punished as a result of them doing so the pay gap between working mothers and fathers is far higher than for childless men and women women experience a penalty for having children while men get a fatherhood bonus some of the pay gap between mothers and fathers is explained by the fact that so many working mothers go parttime after having children analysis shows that working parttime after having children holds back womens earnings and career progression some of this may well be as a result of women working parttime being denied the opportunity to develop the skills needed to progress some will be that they are shut out of for example networking opportunities that take place outside of their office hours but some of the pay discrepancy will also be as a result of the extra discrimination faced by mothers and pregnant women in the workplace research suggests that fathers are regarded by employers more favourably than childless men for example employers tend to allow fathers to be late for work more frequently than childless men and mothers and the fact that women are overrepresented in lowpaid sectors despite now being more highly educated than men on average is a product of structural injustice not choice as a result of both conscious and implicit bias throughout the education system fuelled by pervasive gender stereotyping women remain disproportionately shut out of top jobs in science and engineering it is no coincidence that work that is seen as feminine caring and cleaning remains some of the most undervalued and underpaid work in our economy gender pay reporting mandatory from this year for every organisation with more than employees is an important step forwards without transparency discrimination remains hidden but it is not enough we need to encourage men to play a greater role in family life for example by giving all men a longer period of use it or lose it paternity leave in the first year of their childs life we need to ensure that opting to work parttime does not result in women choking off their career progression and we need to ensure that more women pursue careers in highly paid industries while improving pay and working conditions in femaledominated jobs such as caring and cleaning the last years have shown that there is a long way to go before we achieve what is selfevidently just and right for women it will require radical cultural and social reforms from eradicating the effects of implicit bias to creating a society in which it is possible for mothers and fathers to share their caring responsibilities

monday boomerang kids adult children who return to their parents home because they cant afford a place of their own are seldom out of the news these days one recent report tried to work out a formula for how much parents should charge a child who turns up announced while another concluded that parents quality of life nosedived every time a kid boomeranged i have rather mixed feelings about this my daughter is currently sharing a flat with her boyfriend and has just announced they may move to minneapolis for a few years while my son who is about to finish university says he would rather live in the back of a van and travel round europe for a year picking up odd jobs rather than come home for more than a few days at a time plans may change and hard financial realities may kick in at some time of course but part of me is thrilled both that my wife and i have brought up two children who have the confidence to leave home and that everything that was in the fridge when i left the house will still be in it when i get back but i also miss them a great deal even when they are annoying its sods law when they were young i spent a long time wishing they were more independent and now that they are i wish they were a little less so tuesday according to one of my lobby friends who has forgotten more about politics than i will ever know one of the great unexplained mysteries of westminster is how boris johnson remains foreign secretary time and again he seems to get away with things that would have cost lesser mortals their job today he came to parliament to answer an urgent question on britains relations with russia following the suspected poisoning of the former spy sergei skripal and his daughter yulia boris had one job to sound tough while remaining noncommittal and refusing to speculate on the outcome of any investigation something that comes as second nature to most ministers who spend hours at the dispatch box saying nothing for the first minutes or so boris stuck to his brief but then he couldnt help himself and unilaterally announced that we were at war with russia the usual protocol for starting a war is a cabinet discussion followed by a warning to the foreign power in question not content with that he then went on to say that if as he suspected the russians were behind the assassination attempt then britain wouldnt be competing in the world cup boris seemed unaware that scotland wales and northern ireland had already taken that decision by deliberately failing to qualify for the finals and that if past performance was any guide england would voluntarily make their own protest by refusing to play and getting knocked out in the group stages wednesday it ended as it so often does in heartbreak having dominated much of the game at wembley and taken a halftime lead spurs lost concentration for a fourminute spell after the break and were knocked out of the champions league by juventus though i was bitterly disappointed by the result i did take some masochistic pleasure in the nature of the performance over the many years ive been supporting spurs one of their traits ive most come to value is that they so often let you down their disappointments mirror my own and somehow make me feel better about myself they do my failing for me im not sure i could quite cope with supporting a team who regularly lift trophies not only would i start taking success for granted it would also make me feel inadequate the loss to juve was classic spurs first the hope as tottenham appeared capable of swatting aside the italian champions then the crushing sense of defeat after several years of watching spurs play some of the best football i have ever seen it was as if normal service had been albeit temporarily resumed and im sure sundays long trek down to the south coast to watch them play bournemouth in the premier league will be all the sweeter for it thursday the worlds oldest message in a bottle has been found on a beach in western australia nearly years after it was tossed overboard from a german ship in the indian ocean scientists believe the bottle had floated at sea for the best part of a year before getting washed up and buried in the sand even though the message was basically only a list of coordinates the bottle was apparently one of many thrown overboard as part of an experiment to measure currents its survival still appealed to the romantic in me a voice from the past finally getting heard when i was a child my father encouraged me to put a message in a bottle and throw it over the side of the small boat we were sailing in off the pembrokeshire coast he handed me a schweppes bitter lemon bottle and told me to ask whoever found it to return it to our home address and that we would refund the postage i thought no more about it for several months until a letter arrived for me the bottle had been found sadly it hadnt as i had hoped travelled half way round the world it had wound up on a beach several miles from where i had thrown it friday a new survey by a global education charity has found that british parents are among the worst for helping their children with their homework only the japanese and the finns came out worse although thankfully our days of having to supervise homework are long past in my wifes and my defence our performance wasnt always always down to sheer laziness both our children were always extremely reluctant to ask us for any assistance not because they had the cando ethic of wanting to sort their maths and english problems for themselves but because they both assumed from an early age that we were congenital idiots who couldnt possibly know anything and they werent always wrong when my daughter was writing her final essay for her english alevel on meanings of love in three works of literature she finally agreed to let me read her final draft as i knew the three books in question well i made what i thought were helpful revisions and helped her to rewrite certain sections in shorter sentences to make it more readable to my surprise she must have been desperate she accepted all my suggestions the draft came back as a fail with the comment that many of my insights were just plain wrong and that the use of short sentences was a big mistake she went back to the original text she had written before i got my mitts on it and duly got an a digested week

this is no country for children pious politicians pretend children are our future but the uk seems to prefer its past in rights and priorities children are standing at the counter waiting to be served as adults shove them out of the way with a cascade of reports revealing our collective neglect of children the national audit office on thursday reports on the crippled finances of local government funding cut by half despite skyrocketing demand for social services especially for children vanishing early prevention with overstretched social workers causes an alarming rise in children in care reaching an unprecedented last year every study shows why poverty lack of housing neglected parental mental health even the assumption that every child goes to school turns out to be wrong as ofsted warns today it has no power to protect growing numbers of home educated children who are sometimes either put into unregistered religious schools or simply abandoned the government puts parents rights to home school before childrens rights without protection from parents who may be psychotic obsessive cultish or religious sectdriven but some of these disappeared children are simply dumped says the office of the schools adjudicator finding schools offrolling inconvenient children telling their parents to home school underachievers to keep up their league table results one council area has offrolled almost children inevitable when the schools have become torture chambers for results not places where childrens happiness comes first wouldnt you expect childrens mental health to be the top priority catching problems early to escape a lifetime of suffering instead they are waiting as long as months for treatment a promised guarantee of fast help wont apply until if then this is while selfharming rises and only of children and young people in england who need treatment for their mental health are able to access it benefits for million families take yet another hit from april the resolution foundation reports on thursday that a couple with two children will lose cuts far outweighing minimum wage rises the institute for fiscal studies finds that benefit cuts freezes and the twochild limit will seeing child poverty hit a record by lifechances diminished that will reverse all the gains made in the last years thats the point childrens wellbeing is reversing wherever you look when the chancellor gloats next week that the budget is balanced the deficit target hit remember children contributed most apologies for this long list of woe but there is more the vanished youth service and childrens centres dwindling health visitors and school nurses ofsted hasnt even visited childrens centres for more than five years so no one knows whats left heres the big question have we become a country that really really doesnt like children that unwelcoming grudge is often reflected in punitive political attitudes people shouldnt have any children if they cant afford them the state shouldnt have to support them no wonder the entire social mobility commission resigned exasperated by pious nonsense about opportunity from a government pulling the rug from under childrens chances the great political divide is best reflected in approaches to children tony blair and gordon brown directed all their redistribution towards children in tax credits sure start free nurseries schools education maintenance allowances and the child trust fund to welcome every baby they assumed thats how voters hearts would be touched to make redistribution politically acceptable but the lack of indignation at how children have been treated since suggests that might be wrong people would rather punish poor parents even if it harms children widespread ignorant rejection of poverty statistics allows people to shrug off rising deprivation theyve all got flatscreen tvs let them eat porridge a gradgrind exam factory school curriculum is what tory voters want so theres political mileage in announcing yet tougher timestables testing to add to suffocating testing mania this government senses a deep well of political support for being nasty to children are they right it would take a great

the gender pay gap in financial services is astonishing its almost years since international womens day was first observed and still we find women at some of the countrys top financial institutions are paid half as much as men firms with more than employees are required to publish details of their gender pay gap by april barclays international has published a mean gender pay gap of for bonuses its meaning that for every of bonuses handed out to men women are only getting the respective figures are and for rbs and and for lloyds the prevailing reason for this disparity is the much higher proportion of men than women in senior roles the number of women diminish in line with seniority as part of the treasury committees women in finance inquiry were seeking to identify the barriers to women entering and progressing in the financial services industry if more women are in senior roles it should follow that the gender pay gap reduces were examining the value to financial firms of having greater gender balance across all job grades and functions and scrutinising the role of government and financial regulators in acting as role models for good gender diversity practices five key themes have emerged firstly gender diversity pays its good for the bottom line credit suisse found that companies where women make up at least of senior managers had more than higher profitability than those where female representation was less than other benefits include a reduced chance of groupthink enhanced connection to customers and access to a wider talent pool secondly the picture so far isnt great a more gender diverse team brings benefits but only one in four board members of financial services firms are women only of chief executives of financial services firms are women there is clearly a long way to go thirdly culture is important witnesses have told us that the alpha male culture in financial services at senior levels is deterring women jayneanne gadhia chief executive of virgin money described this as a culture of winning at all costs rather than doing the right thing recurring cultural themes of our inquiry include sexual comments from male superiors stereotyping by the old boys club and its arcane recruitment practices the motherhood penalty opaque bonus criteria and presenteeism whereby performance is judged by visibility rather than output its up to all of us men and women to demonstrate that its possible to work in a different way amber rudd said firms are likely to increase profitability by appointing more women to senior roles she urged firms to close the gap by promoting more women from junior positions changing recruitment practices and allowing flexible working fourthly unconscious biases are at play a report by oliver wyman observed that the biggest challenge lies in changing the stereotypes assumptions and biases about what is required for leadership and success that permeate the culture of financial institutions when evaluating the suitability of a woman for a role or using certain language in job advertisements biases can creep in finally transparency is key for driving change as jayneanne gadhia says what gets measured gets done shining a light on issues like the gender pay gap and whether firms are imposing and meeting targets is how diversity gets pushed up the priority lists of boards greater transparency allows for more effective scrutiny the women in finance charter and requirement for firms to publish data on their gender pay gap are therefore welcome requiring firms to report their gender pay gap figures however isnt a magic wand its a step in the right direction but some firms may fail to meet these obligations or publish inaccurate information the risk of reputational damage causing good female talent to decline to work for a firm based on its disclosure is the strongest reason for firms to address their gender pay gap but sunlight is the best disinfectant and as the equalities and human rights commission ehrc has stated sanctions may be necessary to ensure openness and transparency the government has said it will keep an open mind about going further in terms of regulations and sanctions but a good starting point would be to include the salaries of partners when reporting the gender pay gap they are classified as owners rather than employees so technically theyre exempt from figures but as role models in their organisations they should know better than to exclude themselves to skew the figures there is some dispute over the ehrcs ability to fine firms who dont publish accurate data or dont make sufficient progress in reducing their gap but money talks and perhaps more of the stick may eventually be needed to close the gender pay gap the world economic forums global

it is international womens day a day to celebrate the achievements of women around the world and how far weve come in the fight for equality while also recognising how far we still have to go action is long overdue in tackling the scandal of unequal pay so im announcing labours policy to require employers to take action in closing their gender pay gaps and ending unequal pay a labour government will ensure employers plans are adequate robust and most importantly adhered to under a labour government all public and private companies with more than employees will be required to report what specific action they are going to take over a set period to close their gender pay gaps if they dont they will face further auditing and fines in labour introduced the equal pay act but nearly years later the scourge of unequal pay persists according to the fawcett society women in fulltime employment are paid on average less than men and including parttime work the gap widens to nearly we cannot wait another years for equal pay the government recently introduced a requirement on large employers to report on gender pay but we need action not just audits under labours policy employers will not only have to report on their gender pay gaps they will have to prove they are taking action to close them this means the onus will no longer be on female employees to prove they are being underpaid in comparison with their male counterparts instead the onus will be on employers to prove they are paying employees fairly and have good gender equality practices the deadline for employers to report gender pay discrepancies april is fast approaching but only about companies have submitted their figures so far despite the fact that about employers are estimated to fall under the legislation figures released by the guardian on the data collected so far are devastating of the companies that have reported an incredible pay men more than women just of large employers pay women employees more than the male ones and the equality and human rights commission the body responsible for overseeing this legislation has seen its budget cut by by the conservatives time and time again this governments actions demonstrate how hollow the tories words are on womens equality were following in the footsteps of iceland which consistently ranks as the number one country for gender equality and last year became the first country in the world to require firms to prove equal pay equal pay for women will bring benefits for business too a pricewaterhousecoopers report into the gender pay gap released on monday estimated that closing this gap could bring benefits to the uk economy of bn it is sound business sense that will help to improve the reputation of businesses and make the countrys workforce happier the next labour government will acknowledge and reward good business practice through equal pay employer certifications and we will seek to award government contracts to businesses that obtain certification while in opposition we will put this proposal to a public consultation to obtain feedback from businesses workers womens organisations trade unions and relevant nondepartmental public bodies to ensure we are ready to introduce the policy when we walk into downing street but the deeprooted social and economic inequality facing women runs deeper than the pay gap women have borne the brunt of of the conservatives cuts and more than of those currently earning less than the living wage are women labour will end the tories failed austerity agenda and introduce a real living wage of per hour we will also address the underlying structural issues that allow these disparities to exist including insecurity around selfemployment exploitative zerohours

the shadow education secretary angela rayner is seeking to inflict a series of defeats on the government in the house of commons next week over cuts to free school meals and childcare andrea leadsom the leader of the commons is expected to announce on thursday that the government has granted labour a threehour debate and a series of votes immediately after the chancellors spring statement this tuesday changes to free school meals entitlement childcare vouchers and free childcare for twoyearolds were all due to be made using statutory instruments without a vote in parliament but labour has used an obscure process called praying against the regulations to secure several votes which could prove embarrassing for the government after hammonds statement rayner is seeking to block a series of moneysaving changes including the imposition of an earnings threshold for free school meals as universal credit is rolled out to more households currently all families in england in receipt of uc are entitled to free school meals as a transitional measure while the new benefit is extended across the country but the government now plans to set an income threshold of rayner said not only are the tories taking free school meals and childcare from hundreds of thousands of working families but they are using arcane procedures in a desperate attempt to dodge proper scrutiny from mps if they want to take away free school meals and childcare from struggling parents in low paid jobs tory mps should walk through the lobbies and vote for it the government insists more families will benefit after the changes than under the old preuc system but childrens charities say the policy will create a cliffedge as families earnings rise the childrens society claims that once a family with one child passes the threshold they would need to earn a year more the equivalent of working hours more each week at the national living wage to make up for the loss in free school meals matthew reed chief executive of the childrens society called for all children whose families are on uc to continue to receive a free lunch the government has a golden opportunity to ensure that almost every child in poverty in england does not go hungry at school he said other policies labour will seek to challenge during the threehour debate are the imposition of a similar meanstesting threshold for twoyearolds in receipt of free childcare and the abolition of employer childcare vouchers employerbacked childcare vouchers are being phased out and replaced by a new system of taxfree childcare but labour claims the system is poorly understood and its rollout has been botched the democratic unionist party whose mps usually back mays government in major votes has in the past opposed the abolition of childcare vouchers with may forced to govern without a secure majority since last years general election labour have repeatedly used votes on controversial issues such as uc to embarrass the government a department for education spokesperson said the threshold would only be applied to new claimants so children already entitled to few school meals would not lose them no child who is currently receiving a free school meal will lose out as a result of this change and it is misleading to suggest otherwise the fact is under our new criteria we estimate that by around more children will benefit from a free school meal compared to the previous benefits system its right that we make sure this support reaches children from the most disadvantaged families,2018-03,shadow education secretary angela

women in the uk effectively work for free for more than two months a year because of the countrys gender pay gap according to the tuc in a report published to coincide with international womens day the trade union body called on the government to require employers to carry out pay audits and produce action plans to close the gap in their workplace the gender pay gap is the difference between the average hourly earnings of men and women large companies have to report information about this by the april according to the office for national statistics when all workers full and parttime are included the pay gap is this means that women effectively work for free for the first days of the year said the tuc but it added that in education sector the gap was so the average female worker in the sector has to wait until april before searning the same as the average male worker in the finance and insurance sector the gap is which means the equivalent date is may said the organisation frances ogrady the tucs general secretary said nearly years since the ford machinists went on strike at dagenham the uk still has one of the worst gender pay gaps in europe companies publishing information on their gender pay gaps is a small step in the right direction but its nowhere near enough meanwhile separate research suggests progress made in getting more women into top leadership roles is going into reverse in of chief executives were women but this year it fell to according to egon zehnder a global recruitment firm which surveyed the largest companies in the uk the survey also shows that while of chief financial officers were women two years ago today the proportion is and out of chief executive appointments to these companies since only three have gone to women in egon zehnder made a public commitment to a target of a quarter of ftse chief executives being women by another study has found that a third of working women earning below the voluntary living wage about million people have no savings at all including pensions the living wage foundation and the fawcett society said their findings revealed that three out of five lowearning working women only had enough savings to last a month at most if they lost their job they also found that worried about their financial situation and did not see their financial situation improving within a year the

on the first day of the un decade for women in the women of iceland took the day off to demonstrate the importance of all their work waged and unwaged in the countryside and the city almost all women who were physically able came out of their homes offices and factories and even female television presenters were replaced on the screen by men holding children some of women took part they called it a day off but we at the international wages for housework campaign called it a strike and took as our slogan their placard which said when women stop everything stops iceland was not international but it was of international significance what moved them to strike had to be moving in the souls of women everywhere the question was when would it manifest itself in at the final conference of the un decade in nairobi we had won the un decision that unremunerated work at home on the land and in the community should be measured and valued we called time off for women for october and a number of countries joined us but we could not sustain international action it was not until that margaretta darcy a writer antiwar and irish republican activist called for a national strike of women in ireland to mark the new millennium on march and asked the wages for housework campaign to support her call i wrote to the national womens council of ireland telling them that if they called the irish women out on strike we would make it global they didnt but we did we launched the global womens strike with margaretta and women from a number of other countries at the un in new york in in most of the countries where women went on strike it was a celebration not a mobilisation but we were making a variety of demands the first was payment for all caring work in wages pensions land and other resources what was more valuable than raising children and caring for others we asked invest in life and welfare not military budgets and prisons the more women went out to work the harder it was to also be a carer and what was most galling was the lower pay for doing a double day caring and pay equity have risen on the political agenda as well as other injustices that women face beginning with rape and domestic violence often going unpunished two years ago two important movements manifested themselves in poland women went on strike to stop antiabortion legislation they succeeded in getting the government to back down in argentina following police inaction after the rape and murder of a number of women hundreds of thousands took to the streets with the slogan ni una menos not one less their call for an end to femicide swept across latin america and beyond this spoke to a pervasive injustice in the uk for example two women a week are killed by partners or expartners as a result of poland and argentina coming together the international womens strike was formed last year and coordinated by polish women it was agreed that each group would determine their own demands there were regular fourhour skype calls with english and spanish translation with women from more than countries exchanging information about what they would be doing in some countries hundreds of thousands downed tools for some part of the day had rallies and banged pots in others the events were smaller today the idea of women massively withdrawing labour waged and unwaged is not a reality yet the actions now are often overtly antiracist and antievery discrimination antipoverty antiwar antideportation and antiimperialist including in trumps us they are always antiviolence in peru the strike slogan is if our lives have no value produce and reproduce without us every sector brings its own concerns peruvian domestic workers are launching their petition a living wage for caring work in your own home and other peoples but how can you strike if you cant risk being sacked or endangering those you care for this has always been the dilemma especially of the carer on whom vulnerable people depend in countries such as spain where there is general recognition of the strike validity and even union backing its easier for women to walk out for at least part of the day hundreds of thousands are expected to do just that in the uk where such support is not yet forthcoming women can still publicise our situation and what we want changed in callins and letters to the press returning from lunch even minutes late banging pots in the streets or at the window as women in spain did against the iraq war the global womens strike is putting the family courts on trial for unjustly taking children from their mothers in a speakout in the shadow of parliament cleaners are demonstrating for a living wage there is a sex work strike for decriminalisation in soho and a picket of unilever in support of the sisters of rohingyas call for disinvestment from myanmar to end the rape and genocide there in germany another possibility to improve womens lives has opened up which we are bringing to

labour will fine employers who do not close their gender pay gaps the party will pledge on international womens day under a labour government the party said all private and public employers who have workers or more would not only have to audit their gender pay but prove they are taking action to close the gap or face a fine from the government the party plans to publicly consult on the policy including with businesses trade unions and womens organisations including nondepartmental public bodies the government has already introduced a legal requirement for all major employers to publish their data on gender pay and bonuses by april labour said it would go further and impose sanctions on businesses that had significant gaps in the pay of male and female staff it will propose mandatory certification for large firms to have tailored action plans to close the gender pay gap to be certified by the government every two years shadow equalities minister dawn butler said the party believed companies needed to be sanctioned if they didnt act on the data auditing is not enough we need action she said some of the companies are using loopholes to get out of giving the full picture and then theres no real enforcement if you are found to have a huge gap we dont just want people to identify the pay gap we want the pay gap to close labour has already said organisations that can show they are working to close the pay gap are the only ones who will have access to government contracts we will only do business with people paying their employees equally butler said it is an incentive for business to pay women better it is an incentive for progression employers that fail to obtain this certification would face further auditing and eventually fines labour said butler said the model would be like icelands policy where employers are fined a day if they do not submit their data or adequate plans to close the gap wed be looking at doing something similar she said its something that could quickly mount up and thats why its important we look at the business case for doing this huge disparity has emerged in the gender pay audit data that has been published so far this year at easyjet the data showed the hourly rate for women is lower that of their male colleagues and of the bestpaid staff are men while of the worstpaid are women at barclays womens median hourly rate is lower than male colleagues and the data revealed that womens bonuses are lower travel group tui has the largest gender pay gap reported to date by a major uk company with its male employees paid more than double the female staff labour has published its own gender pay audit which found male employees earn more on average than women in the party we do need to close that gap even though it is smaller than average butler said male mps earn more on average than female mps higher than the pay gap at the bbc analysis by the sunday times found last week taking outside earnings and ministerial salaries into account butler said the disparity among mps showed how a gender pay gap could emerge even when employees are ostensibly paid the same amount the average bonus pay gap is its similar to how male mps end up being paid more than female mps she said its a difficult one to tackle apart from promoting more women as ministers which is always a good thing an international womens day flag is set to fly over parliament for the first time on wednesday at butlers suggestion as mps and peers mark the day with a debate in both houses of parliament the speaker of the house john bercow said the flag would remind us of what has been achieved and how far their is to go to achieve full gender equality and said it was an initiative supported by mps from all parties as parliamentarians commemorated years of the first women getting the vote,2018-03,labour fine employer close gender pay gap party pledge international womens day labour government party said private public employer

domestic abuse suspects face being banned from contacting their victims drinking alcohol or taking drugs and face electronic tagging to monitor their movements under a new civil protection order as part of a consultation launched by theresa may on thursday breaches of any of the conditions of the new domestic abuse protection civil order will be punishable as a criminal offence ministers say they are designed as an early intervention measure to shield victims from further abuse from unconvicted suspects family civil or criminal courts may grant the new orders on a freestanding application from a victim or a member of their family or a support service without the need for police backing the orders form part of a wideranging consultation on measures to be included in the governments draft domestic abuse bill which includes a new statutory definition of abuse that for the first time recognises economic abuse this would include forcing someone to take out loans withholding access to wages or bank accounts food clothing or transport the government consultation paper also includes proposals to create a domestic abuse commissioner tougher sentences for domestic abuse cases involving children and special measures for victims in court including testifying behind screens or by video link so they do not have contact with their abusers may writing in the guardian said thousands of women endure unimaginable violence and other forms of abuse every single day often at the hands of those to whom they are closest in the places they should be safest i have heard many heartwrenching stories and i am determined to stop others suffering she writes that the consultation proposals build on the work she started in the home office i was fortunate enough to grow up in a warm and loving home it is hard for those of us who have safe and happy lives to truly walk in the shoes of those who live with domestic abuse every single day i want everyone to live free from that threat and every child to grow up safe and protected just as i did the home secretary amber rudd said that nearly million people every year the majority of them women suffer domestic abuse through this bill i want to fundamentally change the way we as a country think about domestic abuse recognising that it is a crime that comes in many forms physical emotional economic this is about creating a society that protects individuals and families at the earliest opportunity the consultation paper says the new civil domestic protection orders could include flexible conditions such as not contacting the victim including online not to go within a certain distance of the victim and bans on drinking alcohol or taking drugs positive requirements could include attending programmes on parenting or to address their underlying attitudes as well as drug or alcohol treatment they could also be required to notify the police of any relationship as well as being electronically tagged to monitor their movements as yet undefined criminal sanctions would follow a breach of the conditions the duration of the orders would be determined by the courts in each case in contrast to the current protection orders which have a day limit the first ever statutory definition of domestic abuse would cover psychological physical sexual economic and emotional abuse and would not be limited to women and girls but recognise abuse that happens in all relationships labours shadow home secretary diane abbott said there was more the government could and should do any measures to combat domestic violence are welcome however this tory government has spent the last eight years cutting the very services those fleeing abuse rely on domestic violence is one of the toughest crimes to police effectively and its become much more difficult because of the tories cutting police and support for womens refuges she said harry fletcher founder of the victims rights campaign also welcomed the draft bill but noted that no timetable has yet been set out for its parliamentary progress the governments future domestic abuse reforms will only be effective if they are properly funded he said the victims rights campaign and plaid cymru ran an effective campaign to create a new offence of coercive control in two years later and just of frontline police have been trained and not surprisingly there have not been many prosecutions for this serious crime if the consultation reaches victims of abuse it will result in positive change but only if the culture within the justice system towards those victims changes too,2018-03,domestic abuse suspect face banned contacting victim drinking alcohol taking drug face electronic tagging monitor movement new civil protection order part consultation launched

last year i pledged to bring forward new legislation as part of my longstanding commitment to end domestic abuse thousands of women endure unimaginable violence and other forms of abuse every single day often at the hands of those to whom they are closest in the places they should be safest i have heard many heartrending stories and i am determined to stop others suffering doing so will require a change across the whole of society in the way we think about and tackle domestic abuse prosecutions and convictions are increasing but it is not good enough in women and men were killed by a partner or former partner nearly million people the majority of them women live with domestic abuse every day young people have their childhoods destroyed by scenes of appalling domestic abuse no child should ever have to witness the governments new domestic abuse bill will lead the way in bringing about the change we need i am launching a consultation on our proposals and we want to hear from experts charities frontline professionals and as many people affected by abuse from as many walks of life as possible many suffering abuse still dont talk about what is happening to them not all abusive behaviour is physical controlling manipulative and verbally abusive behaviour ruins lives and means thousands end up isolated living in fear so for the first time the bill will provide a statutory definition of domestic abuse that includes economic abuse alongside other nonphysical abuse we will recognise the lasting impact domestic abuse can have on families by allowing for tougher sentences in cases involving children and will better protect victims with new domestic abuse protection orders which allow police and courts to intervene earlier we will also create a domestic abuse commissioner to act as a national champion for victims these proposals build on the work i started in the home office it is critical that people fleeing violent partners have a safe place to go i am committed to delivering a sustainable funding model for refuges so that there is no postcode lottery we have provided m for accommodationbased services such as refuges the best available data shows bed spaces have increased by since we must also act to ensure that victims are supported at the earliest possible opportunity before abuse escalates and they are left with no option but to flee their own homes i was fortunate enough to grow up in a warm and loving home it is hard for those of us who have safe and happy lives to truly walk in the shoes of those who live with domestic abuse every

welcome to the guardians weekly update on the gender pay gap this year for the first time all public and private sector organisations in great britain with more than employees will have to reveal the difference between what they pay men and women about companies almost in the past week have filed figures so far but the legislation is expected to affect about companies which collectively employ more than million people as of this week companies pay men more and companies pay women more the median is the figure that falls in the middle of a range when everyones wages are lined up from smallest to largest the median is a typically a more representative figure as the mean can be skewed by a handful of highly paid employees what we learned this week the mining company anglo american reported stark differences in what men and women are paid it reported not only a hourly pay gap meaning women earn half as much as men on average but also a gap in bonus payments the quartiles show women make up only of the toppaid staff but account for of the lowestpaid workers the first russell group universities also reported figures the university of southampton posted a median hourly pay gap of and a median bonus gap of meaning on average women receive half the bonus paid to men the university of manchester also reported a median bonus pay gap indicating that for every paid to a male employee in bonus pay a woman would receive p on average figures released by the university attribute a large proportion of the pay gap to clinical staff employed by the university specifically a high proportion of male academics who are very senior clinicians with a number of years seniority on average santanders female employees earn less than men who make up of the top earners at the banking group women make up the majority of employees at all other levels including of the lowestpaid at the groups banking arm santander uk women also earn less on average and receive an average of less in bonus pay the bank said it was confident that men and women were paid equally for the same roles but admitted our gender pay and bonus gaps show that we have real work to do to increase the number of women in senior leadership roles women at asda are paid less than male staff thats no surprise as while of the supermarkets lowestpaid workers are women of its top earners are men men also excel when it comes to bonus pay where the median gap is asdas senior vicepresident of people hayley tatum said whilst our gender pay gap is better than the national average we recognise that like many businesses we have challenges when it comes to female representation in more senior roles and that is something were committed to addressing the company is facing an equal pay claim by nearly mainly

gender pay gap shows that it is largely driven by the fact that there are more men in senior higherpaid roles within the business when we adjust for this factor our pay gap drops to why it would

domestic abuse is still underreported in england despite a recent rise in offences recorded by police according to a report by womens aid despite the police recording a increase in recorded incidents of domestic abuse offences in just less than three years a recent survey of abuse survivors who use the charitys refuges and outreach support services in england showed there continued to be low levels of women reporting domestic abuse to the police in its report survival and beyond published on wednesday womens aid reveals that only of women using communitybased services reported domestic abuse while who use refuges reported according to the report even fewer women had seen criminal sanctions or a criminal case against the perpetrator or perpetrators of abuse of the communitybased service users and of the women resident in refuge services the charity says it believes the low reporting levels underline a need for continuing support of refuges alongside improvements in the criminal justice process the latter being the subject of a new domestic abuse bill set to go out to consultation on thursday international womens day katie ghose the chief executive of womens aid said from our work with survivors we know that it takes a lot of strength and courage for women to build up the confidence to report domestic abuse to the police the police have made significant progress in transforming their response to tackling domestic abuse but for some women the barriers to reporting to the police or proceeding with a prosecution will remain insurmountable thats why it is vital that all agencies from healthcare to housing make tackling domestic abuse their business our new findings show that very few women experiencing domestic abuse see any criminal justice outcomes in their cases and have limited involvement with the police but they do access lifesaving support from specialist services thats why refuges and communitybased support services are vital for survivors to be able to get the help they need when and where they need it these lifesaving services are not an optional extra but an essential piece of the jigsaw in our response to domestic abuse they not only provide survivors and their children with a safe space and vital support but they are also often the key to survivors having the confidence to report the abuse to the police the domestic abuse bill consultation expected to be launched on thursday risks being overshadowed by the crisis faced by womens refuges amid a major ukwide funding overhaul proposed by the ministry of housing communities and local government it plans to remove refuges and other forms of shortterm supported housing from the welfare system this would mean vulnerable women fleeing abusive partners not being able to pay for their accommodation using housing benefit the final guaranteed source of income available to refuges on average housing benefit makes up of refuge funding ghose added the governments planned changes to the way refuges are funded threatens the future of these lifesaving services if these planned funding changes go ahead refuges will be faced with the awful reality of either turning more women and children away or closing their doors forever the landmark domestic violence and abuse bill is a onceinageneration opportunity to make sure survivors and their children get the support they need but the governments plans for refuge funding risk undermining the bills good intentions we want the government to give survivors a castiron guarantee that these disastrous planned changes to the way refuges are funded are off the table and that they will work with us to create a longterm and sustainable funding model so that every survivor and her child can safely escape domestic

frances mcdormand stole the oscars with an acceptance speech in which she placed her award on the floor in front of her and then asked every female nominee in the audience to stand up so that thegatekeepers in the room could see whom to contact about project ideas challenging hollywood executives to take practical steps to tackle inequality the best actress winner also called for inclusion riders clauses in alister contracts that stipulate diversity quotas for a films cast and crew using the alist actors negotiating power to enforce more diverse recruitment practices mcdormands powerful statement shone light on exactly the right spot because it is with the executives and decisionmakers that change needs to start specifically the hiring and commissioning practices of a highly exclusive circle of influencers diversity policy and practice to date has been led by the idea that if individuals can improve their connections or skills they can succeed in the cultural professions but that wont bring change the harvey weinstein scandal revealed powerfully and painfully how a select handful of people typically male and white control opportunities for the rest of the film workforce on and off screen but their power and the misuse of that power is by no means limited to hollywood or confined to sexual harassment across the arts and culture producers and commissioners artistic and creative directors curators and editors members of admissions and audition panels aampr managers educators project leads and agents afford or withhold opportunities to develop talent to pursue creative ideas and ambitions and to earn a living these people make crucial decisions on individual careers from admissions into art school to internships and jobs and crowning cultural leaders they decide what gets produced in arts and culture and who gets to produce it postweinstein this shift of attention is almost revolutionary for so long the diversity debate has been dominated by a model of individual deficiency the idea that female workingclass and ethnicminority workers tend to lack the connections networks skills or confidence to make it on the otherwise ohsolevel playing fields of the oscars grammys turner and so on a study for the british film institute to be published this week describes this approach as focusing on enabling initiatives training networking and mentoring programmes targeted to help specific groups of workers get in and get on these initiatives have undeniably opened doors for creative talent but they have not affected how the decisions about who gets in are made again credit where its due things had slowly started to change before weinstein for instance with initiatives such as the bfis diversity standards which put the onus on businesses rather than individuals but as riz ahmed pointed out in his diversity speech to the house of commons preweinstein such attempts to change the system had a whiff of wellintentioned but somewhat naive worthiness of trying to engineer a socially desirable but under business constraints also somewhat optional extra outcome weinstein has individualised the system making it possible to single out individuals who can and should act differently and mcdormand has shown how that legacy of weinstein can create positive change beyond sexual harassment by giving an individual face to the system inclusion riders are one possible tool but insisting on an inclusion rider might diminish an individual actors chances of getting hired themselves to really make a difference inclusion riders would need to be established as standard and backed up by unions so that individual actors couldnt gain a competitive advantage by not having one in their contract mcdormands other move is the more powerful one pointing out that the system is in the house that it has tangible individual representatives in the gatekeepers and that those gatekeepers can exercise a choice over whom they talk to and whose ideas they engage with right there and then responsible gatekeeping is already making a difference in clubbing with a new generation of promoters responding to the demand for more inclusive nights out the screen sector and arts and culture more broadly need that too and fast lets see where we are come the next oscars dr doris ruth eikhof is deputy director of the cameo research institute for

sparkly colourfully clad women in the foyer downstairs encouraged people walking past to write down their insecurities and then shred or burn them which was done with much giggling and whooping it was a small moment but it mirrored a sentiment we picked up a lot at this years all about women festival there was joy and celebration but underlying one could feel steely determination women would not put up with injustice and inequality anymore the festival with panels talks and live recordings of podcasts came in the wake of a global reawakening of feminism the metoo movement was created by activist tarana burke in as a grassroots initiative to reach sexual assault survivors in underprivileged communities following the harvey weinstein revelations the actor alyssa milano fired up the metoo discussion with the tweet if youve been sexually harassed or assaulted write me too as a reply to this tweet women from across the world including australia responded with stories of systematic harassment revealing the monumental scale of the problem yet for all the horror there was strength in the solidarity of women and hope that perhaps this time change could come here are some things weve learned we must lean into joy tarana burke spoke via satellite from los angeles she said as a survivor of sexual assault joy saved her life it was important to acknowledge the trauma but even more crucial to cultivate joy burke left us with the galvanising message that we must shift the narrative of metoo focusing on survivors and working towards finding solutions or we would fail the movement and all those women and men who have bravely shared their stories burke is expected to speak at the oscars tonight australian journalist and trailblazer tracey spicer announced in october that she would make public the names of longterm offenders of sexual harassment in australias media industry she invited her social media followers to share their stories of harassment and abuse hundreds of women came forward without being able to reveal further details spicer announced that an australian version of times up is imminent at the beginning of this year over women of hollywood formed times up as an antiharassment coalition organising legal defense to support women and men who have experienced sexual harassment assault or abuse in the workplace spicer said australia needed nothing less than a cultural change in all areas of society ss we can have intimacy and autonomy theres more single women in the us and most western countries than ever before in history kate bolick has explored the history of single women interspersed with her own experience of dating and being single in the book spinster in i was charmed by kates bubbly energy but also slightly doubtful and just maybe a tinge defensive about my own nonspinsterhood is this celebration of single living the ultimate egocentric endeavour there probably should be a followup book to spinster because gasp kate bolick the priestess of spinsterhood has a boyfriend so it seems bolicks quest isnt so much about having a partner or not having one it is navel gazing yes but it comes in the form of cultivating your inner voice and trusting your instinct it is the lifelong journey to be comfortable in your own skin in order to be a good friend a lover a mother or whoever you choose to be without falling into the trap of typification and to then achieve both intimacy and autonomy the dualism bolick describes is certainly something worth striving for ss feminism is still excluding women with disabilities all women are still not included in the feminism tent that was apparent during the disability and intersectionality panel discussion with activists kath duncan samantha connor and katharine annear the group discussed the othering of those with disability not having led their own movement and their ongoing experiences of being excluded notably by other women were not expected to have jobs were not expected to have relationships were not expected to be at the pub said connor inclusiveness and intersectionality is part of new wave feminism so it was shocking to hear these women described situations where they had been excluded from the feminist discussion whether it was annear describing a feminism conference ostensibly focused on disability yet with limited accessibility or connor describing the constant soft bigotry of low expectations indeed it was alarming to hear connor say she had been told that feminists were not disabilitys foot soldiers these women are suffering many of their hurdles are extreme versions of historical hurdles faced by women for example of women with a cognitive disability are sexually abused with their life expectancy is years of age while disabled people are more likely to be at risk of poverty feminism hasnt succeeded until all women are liberated as beauty can heal during troubled times any discussion of beauty can be fraught for feminists but to hear author rebecca walker discuss it beauty can be a way of pushing back walker an acclaimed feminist thinker described how she turned to the search for beauty after the election of trump we were dealing with the loss of a compassionate being barack obama and the replacement with someone who seemed so inhumane i thought if we forget about this holistic beauty model and we allowed this to become the new normative that we would lose a great thing indeed she spoke about reaching for beauty instead of despair in trying times i needed to find a place to go that would be restorative and healing i needed to remember that when i feel so depleted that actually aesthetic beauty is what can feed me and make me feel whole again she described the women in africa who still wear colourful clothing while their countries are at war they understand that without that they are lost thats what sustains them and its the same for us we are in this battlefield right now and turning to that instinct to create and manifest beauty is what i needed she went on to say it wasnt just aesthetic beauty but also generosity of spirit open heartedness and understanding that was helping her through these troubled times as the label feminism is still important how do you deal with someone no another woman who says they dont need feminism for those of us that describe ourselves as feminists its one of the movements persistently perplexing question for anne summers its simple they are misguided her answer was met with delight and applause when she responded to an audience member with the perennial question summers added a lot of women have collaborated in their oppression and they are eventually going to have to see the light author rebecca walker had a different response making the case for having compassion for those women walker likes to try to understand why they feel the way they do and she said often they didnt respond as she expected theyd say my experience of feminism is irrelevant to the things i care about she added often its about trying to have a conversation and have an openness to what they are bringing she added that she preferred those women more when they didnt have power not like the of white american women who voted for trump i have a lot to say to those women i want them to understand the injury they caused later an audience member asked whether feminism was still useful as a label or whether the focus should be on the work and being more inclusive nakkiah lui said she thought the label was important because there is incredible power in supporting visability you need to say i am a feminist because if enough people say it you cannot ignore it as,2018-03,sparkly colourfully clad woman foyer downstairs encouraged people walking past

in her front room in high wycombe buckinghamshire as her toddler has an afternoon nap alka is grabbing a few minutes to herself like any ordinary mum but with only her laptop and phone the yearold is taking on her local council and with it starting a domino effect that could challenge one of the cruellest cuts now taking effect throughout the country the story begins two years ago when alkas son was two weeks old it was a hard time in many ways she had moved to a new area after her mum died of cancer and she had a new baby to care for the local childrens centre was in her words a lifeline a place to meet others mums attend parenting classes and talk to health visitors her son could play in the creche while she had counselling for postnatal depression and grief in the room next door time at messy play involving trays of coloured spaghetti and flour allowed him to be assessed for speech problems with no fuss he then attended a group called little talkers at the centre to help with his speech development then in january buckinghamshire county council announced it would be closing the bulk of the centres in a bid in its words to create a better more coordinated service at a time when theres less money in the public purse in june childrens centres across the county are due to shut their doors and be replaced by nine hubs which the council is describing as community hubs the lifeline parents such as alka rely on will be cut just like that these centres are like a second family people rely on them on a daytoday basis says alka i bet most politicians havent even set foot in one eight years ago government ministers began dismantling the public services relied on locally by largely lowincome families from reductions in social care for disabled people to the closure of libraries used by poor teenagers as a quiet place to study childrens centres the cornerstone of local support for young families are the next vital service on the chopping board since funding for childrens centres in england has been halved from bn to bn as local authorities battle to stay afloat due to unprecedented cuts from central government in buckinghamshire for example will be the councils first year without a revenue support grant a pot of money from central government that can be used for any local need just six years ago the grant was more than m what is happening in buckinghamshire is being replicated nationwide since more than childrens centres have closed as the sure start initiative introduced by a labour government is decimated by cuts look at bristol where this week councillors approved cuts to childrens centres that will see the equivalent of fulltime members of staff being lost or somerset where last month plans were finalised to close twothirds of its sure start centres with facilities across the area set be replaced with eight family centres northamptonshire whose county council has effectively gone bankrupt has already had to reduce funding to childrens centre services by in the last two years alka is working on a nationwide campaign coordinating with families in cambridgeshire leicestershire and kent in her own area she is helping build a team of parents from each of buckinghamshires centres to stop the closures an army of mums and dads launching anything from press releases to the media to protests with placards and chants when i ask buckinghamshire county council about the planned changes it says it is crucial that we reach the children and families who need our help as early as possible and that by being proactive and going out to where families who need us are dealing with the whole family and all of their issues and listening to what families need rather than waiting for them to reach a crisis point it is confident it can make some real positive changes for local families it is yet to be decided how the remaining childrens centre buildings will be used but the council says it is pursuing ideas about how the sites can be repurposed and still provide value for children families and communities alka is far from convinced with all the cuts to funding whats to stop these hubs from closing and how are women meant to get to them when their local centre is closed on paper alka and the other parents are fighting to stop the closure of a couple of dozen buildings but really this is about far more than bricks and mortar or even childrens centres themselves it goes to the heart of what the governments ideologically driven austerity is stripping from local communities how bit by bit any public service can now be removed in the name of shortterm costcutting on top of childrens centres child services generally from teenage pregnancy support short breaks for disabled children and youth centres are skeletal research by action for children shows that since funding for these early intervention services has fallen by bn across england the local government association expects bn more of council cuts to childrens services by at the same time child poverty is expected to soar to record levels standing between the government and the obliteration of family services are parents like alka it is a damning reflection of how deep austerity is running that to ministers in westminster a toddlers wellbeing can now be seen as expendable in an era of cuts our childrens futures are fair game,2018-03,front room

the government has scrapped its policy of withholding benefits from kinship carers who fall foul of the twochild limit after having a child of their own the uturn by the work and pensions secretary esther mcvey on friday comes a week after a high court judge ruled that the policy as it applied to carers who look after younger siblings to prevent them from being taken into care was perverse and unlawful the decision was welcomed by campaigners who said ministers had seen sense after resisting for more than two years calls to exempt kinship carers from the twochild limit ministers promised in after a defeat in the house of lords that kinship carers would not be penalised by the twochild limit however in practice it emerged that the exemption was only for carers who had children first and then became guardian to a third child not the other way around since the twochild limit came into force in april growing numbers of lowincome carers who have been praised in the past by ministers as unsung heroes have lost more than in tax credits and maternity grant entitlements as a result of the policy cathy ashley the chief executive of family rights group said this is extremely welcome news kinship carers and adopters should never have been affected by the twochild limit on child tax credit and its a great shame that the government wasted money fighting this in the courts im very pleased that they have now seen sense mcvey said she had decided to extend support to all kinship carers after reviewing the issue carefully for several months adoptive parents and nonparental carers known as kinship carers have often stepped in to help a family member or close friend in times of need they have provided support and provided a home for a child in need the role these parents play in helping to bring up these children is invaluable and i want to reassure such parents that this change ensures support will be made available to you and this government is backing you the labour mp melanie onn

child poverty action group welcomed the kinship care decision but said she hoped it would be followed by a decision to exempt all children conceived as a result of nonconsensual sex last weeks ruling by mr justice ouseley said the way the exemption was applied differentially to kinship carer households defeated its purpose which was to encourage or at least avoid discouraging a family from looking after a child who would otherwise be in local authority care making the exemption available only if the caredfor child was not the first or second child was he said not rationally connected with the purposes of the legislation and indeed it is in conflict with them kinship carers continue to fall foul of other welfare reforms including the benefit cap and the bedroom tax and do not receive the same rights and allowances due to foster carers and adoptive parents including paid employment leave while the child is settling in children move into kinship care for a variety of reasons including

electronically tagging domestic abusers who are subject to restraining orders would not go far enough to protect victims campaigners have warned the tagging proposal is part of a wideranging consultation on measures to be included in the governments draft domestic abuse bill launched by theresa may last month as part of its response to the consultation the victims rights campaign along with plaid cymru have suggested fitting perpetrators with satellite trackers which would alert their victims if they were nearby as an alternative to tagging if risk was deemed to be high the police could also be automatically alerted harry fletcher director of the victims rights campaign said our proposals are about improving safety and public confidence and allowing victims of domestic abuse and stalking to live their lives without fear manufacturers have told us that they could develop these simple devices and it is important that the government takes these ideas on board and gives them serious consideration safety had to take priority over cost he added indeed if safety was paramount it would reduce health costs under the governments proposals offenders would wear a device that transmitted a signal to a call centre which in turn would register a breach if the device was tampered with or offenders left their home the evidence is overwhelming that tagging and house arrests have no impact on crime fletcher added in fact they could make it worse and put women in real danger of further abuse if the perpetrator is living with the victim in addition to satellite trackers plaid cymru and the victims rights campaign who successfully lobbied to create a new offence of coercive control in have also called for a domestic violence offender register to be introduced they also want improved data collection on instances of domestic abuse and for perpetrators released from prison to undertake preventive programmes as a condition of parole plaid cymrus justice and home affairs spokeswoman liz saville roberts said we know that manufacturers could develop simple devices based on transmitters and receivers that could provide a vital extra layer of security for victims and genuinely reduce the incidents of reoffending by convicted stalkers and abusers a victim would carry a receiver and be alerted if their abuser were to enter a courtimposed exclusion zone with the police also receiving an alert in highrisk incidences above all it would give the victim an increased sense of safety and confidence something that is taken for granted by most of us but is severely lacking amongst some victims of abuse other proposals put out to consultation include banning domestic abuse suspects from contacting their victims drinking alcohol or taking drugs the tagging would come under a new domestic abuse protection civil order breaches of which would be punishable as a criminal offence ministers say the civil orders are designed as an early intervention measure to shield victims from further abuse from unconvicted suspects the bill would include a new statutory definition of abuse that for the first time recognises economic abuse this would include forcing someone to take out loans withholding access to wages or bank accounts food clothing or transport the government consultation paper also includes proposals to create a domestic abuse commissioner tougher sentences for domestic abuse cases involving children and special measures for victims in court including testifying behind screens or by video link so they do not have contact with their

the governments policy of denying financial support to carers who fall foul of the twochild limit on benefit entitlements is perverse and unlawful a high court judge has ruled growing numbers of young carers who voluntarily agree to look after younger relatives in order to prevent them being taken into care have been denied thousands of pounds in benefit support when they decide to have a child of their own although ministers had promised that kinship carers would not be hit by the twochild limit in practice the exemption was only available to carers who had children first and then become guardian to a third child not the other way around mr justice ouseley said this defeated the purpose of the exemption which was to encourage or at least avoid discouraging a family from looking after a child who would otherwise be in local authority care making the exemption available only if the caredfor child was not the first or second child was he said not rationally connected with the purposes of the legislation and indeed it is in conflict with them the ruling means that all children under the guardianship of family members claiming tax credits or universal credit should not be taken into account for the purposes of the twochild limit a wider challenge to the lawfulness of the twochild rule as breaching fundamental human rights to private and family life and to nondiscrimination was not accepted by the court campaigners intend to appeal a government spokesman said we welcome that the court agrees overall that this policy is lawful we value and recognise the important role of people who look after children who would otherwise be in care thats why we will be fully reviewing the judgment and considering our next steps with regards to nonparental carers last year the guardian highlighted the case of alyssa vessey then of grimsby who was when she gave up college to formally care for her three younger siblings after the sudden death of their mother vesseys application for child tax credits and a sure start maternity grant before the birth of her own baby was refused because of the way the twochild rule exemptions were applied by ministers at the department for work and pensions she told the guardian at the time its unfair they are saying if you take on children we wont give you any money if you have a family of your own people who save the government thousands by caring for children should get money and support when they have a family of their own carla clarke solicitor for the child poverty action group which brought the judicial review said the irrationality of limiting the exception for children cared for in kinship arrangements to third or subsequent children has been raised on numerous occasions by various bodies yet rather than accepting such legitimate criticisms and removing the restriction it has required taking the department for work and pensions to court for the unlawfulness to be properly recognised cathy ashley chief executive of the family rights group and spokesperson for the kinship care alliance said this was a pernicious and unjust approach that was criticised by ourselves some mps and peers the high court has rightly found it to be perverse and unlawful melanie onn labour mp for great grimsby said kinship carers should never have been impacted by the twochild limit for child benefit keeping families together is so important and those who care for children in their families often after unexpected tragedy give up so much to help othersthat they were ever impacted by this limit and that government ministers did not change this even after i alerted it to them through debates and numerous letters shows grave misjudgment the twochild limit for child tax credit and universal credit came into force a year ago families that claim tax credits or universal credit and have a third or subsequent child born after april are no longer able to claim a child element for this child or any future children the policy has come under widespread criticism including for its controversial rape clause which provides an exemption from the twochild limit for women who can prove a third child was

a year ago a repugnant policy now known as the rape clause came into force the government established a twochild cap for child tax credits applied to universal credit too but allowed women to claim for further children conceived without their consent womens groups and medical staff warned that among many other problems this risked retraumatising victims by forcing them to disclose assault against their wishes but the measure received relatively little attention in part because it received no parliamentary debate or vote alison thewliss the sharpeyed scottish nationalist mp who spotted it was right to describe the policy as immoral but she was wrong to say that smuggling it into law via a statutory instrument was the final insult for another came this week when the work and pensions secretary esther mcvey was challenged on the policy ms mcvey declared that when victims make the declaration to a third party such as a health worker they could find an opportunity to talk about maybe something that has happened that they never had before so it is potentially double support getting the money they need and maybe an outlet which they might possibly need theresa may avoided such extraordinary insensitivity when the issue was raised at prime ministers questions but made no concessions this was an attempt to recast the ruthlessness of austerity as an act of munificence the government gave but only after taking away from a much wider group and on the cruellest terms it discriminates against many victims since the exemption does not apply to mothers living with their rapist officials appear unaware of how many assaults occur within relationships forcing women to name the child conceived during rape increases the risk that child will discover their origins and be stigmatised and in northern ireland where failure to report a crime is an offence the medical or other staff told about the rape should inform police of the allegation even if victims do not wish to pursue it that puts both in an invidious position but the rape clause is only one element albeit an especially pernicious one within a rotten policy penalising many more families households with more than two children are hit when a parent loses a job or falls ill women who become pregnant unintentionally may find financial pressures tip their decision about whether to continue the pregnancy northern irelands abortion laws mean few women there have such a choice and though the government presents the cap as a matter of holding adults to account for their decisions it is children who pay the child poverty action group says that estimates suggest more than children will be pushed into poverty by the end of the decade representing a increase in child poverty and a similar number will fall deeper into poverty judgment on its legal challenge to the policy is due on friday this affair has sinister resonance with the current windrush scandal in that case too the government initially refused to acknowledge a glaring injustice and it did so because the particular injustice stems from a far broader one a harsh regime pursued for political advantage with a spurious rationale of fairness the creation of a hostile immigration regime is paralleled by the imposition of austerity in the welfare system and its justification with a similarly divisive ethos separating deserving and undeserving candidates for state support in its impact assessment the department for work and pensions said the twochild cap would ensure that the system is fair to those who pay for it as well as those who benefit from it ensuring those on benefits face the same financial choices around the number of children they can afford as those supporting themselves through work in fact of those claiming tax credits are already working this government fosters suspicion and division setting people against one another by immiserating families it also erodes wider bonds and diminishes society scrapping the rape clause would alter not eradicate the unfairness to victims getting rid of the cap that produced it would be to everyones gain,2018-04,year ago repugnant policy known rape clause came force

on monday esther mcvey the work and pensions secretary caused controversy by calling the governments rape clause for child tax credits an opportunity for rape victims to gain emotional support she suggested that demanding rape victims disclose details of their attack to the department for work and pensions dwp would offer double support both emotional and financial since its introduction last year the rape clause has been roundly criticised by mps activists and survivorled organisations the snp mp alison thewliss called it one of the most inhumane and barbaric policies ever to emanate from whitehall mcveys comments this week only heighten the feeling that she and her government colleagues lack empathy for victims and survivors of rape so what is the rape clause in his budget george osborne announced a cut to child tax credits meaning families would only be able to claim the benefit for their first two children the rape clause was an exemption women who have a third child as a result of rape could still receive child tax credits but only under certain circumstances first she must not be living with the man who raped her this ignores the realities facing women trapped in violent relationships many women are frightened to escape an abusive partner particularly as the most dangerous time for a domestic abuse victim is when she leaves forced pregnancy is also a recognised aspect of violent relationships and second in order to get tax credits for a third child a professional who the woman has spoken to about the rape must complete sections of the claim form by claiming that talking to such a specialist who then reports to the dwp is a form of support mcvey betrays a real lack of understanding of trauma and sexual violence the existing rape clause policy forces women to relive the pain and trauma of rape there is the process of filling out the form then theres the need to contact a professional who supported them after the rape thats if such a professional even exists many women dont tell anyone following sexual assault and only of rape victims reported it to the police and finally theres the demand a woman recount the experience to a thirdparty organisation far from offering a space for support requiring women to relive and retell this traumatic incident risks causing a great deal of upset and anxiety even if the thirdparty organisations are well trained to deal with such cases the problem remains she is still being expected to disclose her experience of rape to the government even if she would prefer not to as a result some organisations have refused to cooperate saying the thirdparty processing of claims is not compassionate nor can it ever be made to be so mcvey should also consider how her offer of support is coming at a time when services for rape victims are struggling with funding around women are raped in england and wales every year and yet the organisations designed to help women are repeatedly threatened with cuts in there was widespread concern that nearly half of all rape crisis centres would close due to lack of funding with continued austerity the risk of future closures remains if mcvey and the government were serious about offering support to rape survivors they would not force women to disclose their violent histories they would not penalise women who are trapped in abusive relationships and they would not decimate the safety net that exists to help women instead they would scrap the twochild limit and adequately fund sexual violence support services rape is a brutal violation of a womans boundaries by demanding a woman disclose this devastating experience to the government in order to gain financial assistance the dwp and mcvey are not offering her double support they are instead violating her boundaries once again sian norris is a writer and feminist activist this article was amended on april to make clear that no woman would be asked to discuss her

forcing companies to disclose their gender pay gap has been like pulling back the curtain for the first time were seeing the real picture behind the oftensecretive world of pay one in which every industry from academia and local councils to ftse companies is underpaying women as part of this it has been refreshing to see the impact of race and class on the gender gap discussed despite the fact the gender audit didnt include these factors but disability hasnt been mentioned at all in the uk there is no complex breakdown of disability pay like the gender pay investigation has provided but what we know shows stark inequality the equality and human rights commission ehrc report found that the disability pay gap the difference between what nondisabled and disabled workers earn is on top of that disabled people are significantly more likely to be unemployed lose a job and be in lowwaged work than nondisabled people were also routinely given fewer responsibilities at work and turned down for promotion or refused the job in the first place being a disabled woman in the climate of the gender pay gap then is like being hit from two sides disabled men particularly those from minority ethnic backgrounds arent immune either in some ways losing the gender advantage afforded to white nondisabled men disabled men from the bangladeshi community for example experience a pay gap of a staggering compared with nondisabled white british men according to the ehrc how can bosses get away with this as suzanne moore points out womens unequal pay is justified in a myriad ways from us not trying for competitive roles to being too caring similarly farfetched excuses are used when it comes to disabled people longstanding prejudice around disability that we are pitiable stupid or a burden creates a climate that permits keeping disabled people in lowwaged junior roles even the chancellor philip hammond last year implied disabled workers were less productive while the idea we should be paid less than nondisabled people is a persistently mainstream opinion in the then welfare minister david freud suggested disabled workers may be worth about an hour the message is often forget equal pay if youre disabled you should be grateful for having a job at all in recent years disabled people have routinely been painted as workshy by politicians and the media but what is attributed to choice is largely a product of circumstance disabled people are more likely to work parttime in part because of their health needs exacerbated by the fact that flexible working is often frowned upon by employers the benefits system meanwhile often penalises people too ill for a fulltime job but who take on a few hours a week ive always worked fulltime but because i need more time off sick or to rest as well as later starts i know my earning potential is dwarfed by my nondisabled counterparts until we acknowledge the problem we cant do anything to fix it john lewis for example is using the gender pay gap news to talk to their employees about flexible working and barriers to job sharing at management level this is fantastic and would be ideal if it was to look at how these two measures perfectly suited to many with health problems would help disabled employees too but to really tackle the disability pay gap we need to look at the wider structural inequalities facing disabled people we often have to live in inaccessible housing are cut off from accessible public transport and are excluded from education which means a disproportionate number of disabled people dont get qualifications even qualifications arent enough a graduate with a worklimiting disability is more likely to not have a job than an unqualified person with no disability rather than measures to improve things the government is currently creating extra barriers hundreds of people have had their car which they need to get to the office removed because of benefit cuts funds that provide inwork support such as sign language interpreters for deaf people have been reduced and huge cuts in social care budgets have resulted in disabled people losing the assistant who helps them get dressed in the morning the gender pay audit means the silence around unequal incomes is finally being broken inequality we are shown can no longer be hushed away or buried under excuses nows the time to bring disabled workers into the conversation frances ryan is a guardian columnist,2018-04,forcing company disclose gender pay gap ha like pulling back curtain first time seeing real picture behind

i recently delivered the annual adam smith lecture in kirkcaldy fife it was the first time a woman had been trusted to give this economics lecture all by herself as a marvellous bagpiper led the way it struck me that this might be my glass cliff moment because lets face it im not an obvious choice for such a task but with men now making up twothirds of economics students all but one of the nobel prizewinners for economics having been a man and every single british chancellor of the exchequer somehow having been required to be a boy then finding a woman might have been tricky by happy coincidence i chose as the subject of my lecture womens exclusion from the formal economy or as i like to call it our grossly undervalued domestic product gudp never as it happens has this been more relevant than now as the full horror of the gender pay gap is revealed i have so enjoyed watching the debate unfold highlights include accusing women of conflating pay discrimination with the gender pay gap silly women though nobody benefits more from this apparent confusion than the companies evading legal action better still are those bemoaning the lack of explanatory data while dogmatically concluding that the gender pay gap has nothing to do with discrimination in hiring or promotion decisions and my absolute favourite lets not forget the prochoicers these are the three women on this planet whose privilege and adoration of unfettered capitalism leads them to infer that women simply choose to work for less and guarantees them a slot on every talkshow in the interest of balance but the pay gap isnt the choice of women it is both a cause and consequence of gender inequality in many respects it is more important than pay discrimination because it shines a light on the deep structural inequalities in every part of our society and economy on my way to the lecture i stopped in at the cottage family centre in kirkcaldy this wonderful community service was set up by a group of local parents in and provides a lifeline to poor families in the area in its christmas appeal provided food and presents to children by last year as many as children and families needed its help when they recently learned that they had lost one of their funding streams the extraordinary women who work there offered to take a pay cut so that their community wouldnt suffer the cottage is a stark reminder that poverty is gendered most of the people it serves are women and children who have been first in the line of fire for austerity because as sophie walker leader of the womens equality party has repeatedly pointed out while tax cuts are benefiting men benefit cuts are harming women research carried out by the house of commons library in revealed that it is women who have borne of the burden of austerity since the brilliant staff who work at the cottage are overwhelmingly female no doubt encouraged by an education system that says caring jobs are for women and the scarcity of flexible working in other sectors the relegation of women in our economy means that these sectors are always undervalued and lowerpaid despite growing demand successive governments have prioritised investment in physical infrastructure jobs for the boys while social infrastructure nurses for example is still seen as an expense to be cut i can always tell our economy is in trouble when i watch the news and see the chancellor of the day put on a hard hat and hivis vest to announce some big butch building project we may be in financial hell but look at me handle a brick i hope it makes the guy from no feel like hes doing something but the truth is it doesnt even make economic sense the womens budget group has shown that if you invest of gdp in the care sector you get double the number of jobs compared to the same investment in construction according to save the children mothers would return to the workplace if they could afford childcare reducing outofwork benefits and increasing the tax base in his autumn budget last year the chancellor announced another splurge in infrastructure spending to get britain driving again transport connectivity upgrading motorways on the whole it is mens jobs that are seen as an investment im not having a go at the right here i pride myself on being an equalopportunity blamer jeremy corbyn also pledged a bn investment in infrastructure manufacturing and new industries labours general election manifesto committed to nationalising pretty much everything except childcare and social care they fail to see that the global inequality crisis is a gender inequality crisis our lives are still rigidly divided into economic and social productive and reproductive paid and unpaid one half always has more value than the other the result is that the redistribution of wealth in this country and globally is too often from the poorest women to the richest men eight men to be precise contrary to popular belief they dont in fact work at the bbc eight white men now own the same wealth as the billion people who make up the poorest half of the worlds population and it is women who are disproportionately represented in the poorest half of humanity yet this situation doesnt benefit your average man any more than it does the average woman so if like adam smith you are a fan of selfinterest then you should know that womens equality is better for everyone the fact is more equal societies do better on just about every available metric mental health general health crime rate education and so on mr smith the father of modern economics lived with his mother until she died it was her invisible hand her gudp that left him free to write his great works i think it is now time to honour her contribution too but hey what would i know

family carers who agree to give up work to become fulltime parents to the children of relatives in order to prevent them being taken into care are being left penniless and homeless by welfare changes campaigners say kinship carers hailed by ministers as unsung heroes are typically grandparents aunts or older siblings who step in voluntarily to bring up child relatives after the birth parent dies or is unable to continue because of illness or neglect a new survey of their experiences seen by the guardian shows that many are frustrated at their lack of reward for doing the right thing several report giving up secure jobs after being warned by social services that if they did not become a fulltime carer the child would be put up for adoption having complied they were often left reliant on a benefit system that punished them for not working one in respondents had their benefit capped losing in some cases more than a month or were forced to move home others were sanctioned having their benefits stopped for at least four weeks for failing to search for jobs a similar proportion were forced to pay the socalled bedroom tax after moving to a bigger rented home on the advice of social services in one case a councils housing officers advised a carer to move to a smaller property to avoid the bedroom tax while its social workers insisted she keep the extra room a handful of kinship carers have lost thousands of pounds because of the twochild benefit limit introduced in april which restricts child tax credits to the first two children in a household this affects younger carers who voluntarily parent two or more siblings who are denied social security entitlements when they have a child of their own one woman who was when she became carer to her two teenage siblings years ago said it just seems that when you do the right thing by becoming a kinship carer you will end up being stuck and penalised for doing something purely out of love the survey of kinship carers carried out by the charities family rights group and grandparents plus found that nearly half had given up work and a quarter had reduced their hours while nine out of had endured financial hardship many had spent all their savings or been forced into debt or rent arrears several said they had been evicted campaigners have called for kinship carers to receive the same rights and allowances as foster carers and adoptive parents including paid employment leave while the child is settling in they also want kinship carers to be exempt from the benefit cap the bedroom tax and the twochild benefits limit ministers promised to exempt kinship carers from the twochild policy after a humiliating defeat over the issue in the house of lords two years ago following concern that it would deter potential carers from coming forward however it has emerged that the exemption only applies to carers who have birth children first and then become guardian to a third child not the other way around the majority of the surveyed carers were bringing up children who had suffered neglect or abuse by birth parents who were often mentally ill or substance misusers one in had taken in child relatives whose parents had died a quarter of the carers mostly women were already raising their own children in many cases the children had high support needs including physical disabilities mental illness attachment disorder and emotional or behavioural difficulties several respondents said they were illprepared for the demands of caring struggled with the extra costs and were denied support by local authorities an estimated children in the uk are raised by kinship carers saving the taxpayer billions that might otherwise be spent on foster care or childrens home fees cathy ashley chief executive of family rights group said kinship carers are doing all that could be asked of them by society and more but instead of getting the support they and the children need many kinship carers are left in poverty isolated and having to battle to just make ends meet while often also caring for very traumatised children a department for education spokesperson said every child deserves the best start in life and that includes having a stable nurturing home environment kinship carers help many children who are unable to live with their parents to help with those responsibilities they are eligible for the same benefits as birth parents including child benefit and child tax credits we also require local authorities to publish information on how they support children living in these circumstances anyone experiencing difficulties should contact their local authority for advice and support i went from a very good job to living on benefits jay godfrey was a welloff professional in her s with no children of her own when she became a kinship carer in her elder sister had died from cancer leaving three teenage daughters without hesitation and practically overnight jay stepped in becoming a carer wasnt really a choice godfrey says family love and loyalty trumped all other considerations but she was unprepared for the pressure and disruption that turned her life upside down or for the indifference of the authorities that had encouraged her to become legal guardian to her grieving nieces my partner ended up giving me an ultimatum its me or the girls i chose the children it was difficult i was very isolated says godfrey i went from a very good job earning lots of money having three holidays a year to living on benefits her kinship carer experience was difficult at times traumatic but nine years later she did it all over again when the daughters of her youngest niece who had suffered episodically from serious mental illness and was in a chaotic relationship were taken into care by social services social workers encouraged godfrey to apply for special guardianship for the children if she didnt they said the girls would probably be separated and adopted and she would never see them again they knew family was everything for me godfrey says they put it forward as a choice but they knew they would get the answer they wanted the girls now aged seven and eight have attachment disorder and separation anxiety yet the therapeutic support offered to them has been limited godfrey says she survives on housing benefit and a week in special guardianship allowance it puts food on the table and nothing else my parents provided every bit of clothing the girls wear it is unfair she says that foster carers get much more support for doing the same role and that having eagerly facilitated the guardianship the council now seems intent on doing the bare minimum to assist her i feel like i am the only one who is invested in these children to ensure they have as good a life as i can offer them she would never have ducked the challenge of kinship care she says but she wishes the situation didnt feel so fraught and exploitative but amid the stress there is hope and beauty the two children come in from school and put their arms around me and tell me they love me and they make my heart sing,2018-04,family carers agree give work become fulltime parent child

amelia gentleman angry about the pay gap april was helpful in separating out the various reasons for unequal pay together with ideas for women to tackle the problem but where is the advice to employers that unequal pay is often the result of unequal opportunities and where is the recognition that they employers also have a part to play in providing solutions many jobs advertised as fulltime could be done by parttimers or as job shares there are easytofind organisations out there with experience in advising about this where are the talent spotters identifying women in their companies with the capacity to learn and do more enabling them to move into the higherpaid maledominated areas and lets not forget the responsibility of government years after these issues were first raised we still have too few girls choosing stem subjects a well understood avenue to wellpaid employment childcare often affordable for parents of one child out of reach for more than one hence the exodus of women from decently paid fulltime jobs with prospects into parttime work almost always at the bottom of the pay and opportunities ladder exposure of the gender pay gap is of course helpful but only actions and commitment to solutions will start to solve the problem margaret prosser labour house of lords the figures so far are fairly crude and open to a degree of interpretation as some people will not be included in the calculations but the pattern is clear most companies report a pay disparity in favour of men and the construction and finance sectors seem to be the worst offenders the real reason for the pay gap is not necessarily that women are getting paid less for the same work as men but more likely that they are not getting into the higherpaid positions and if companies want to reduce their gender pay gap this is the area that would make a difference it will be interesting to see what happens next the reasons given by companies for their pay gap suggests a tendency to make excuses rather than accept that there is an imbalance which they could do anything about the obligation to report is an annual one so we will need to wait another year to see if progress is being made amy richardson associate solicitor coffin mew brighton theresa mays gender pay gap data however imperfect does shed a little light for all their criticism of gary linekers pay the guardian associated newspapers times newspapers express newspapers channel television and itv all have larger average pay gaps than the bbc bt where women earn a little more on average than men is an example to the likes of hsbc and plymouth hospitals nhs trust perhaps the labour party could press theresa for even more information next time philip kerridge bodmin cornwall reading boswells life of dr johnson i came upon the following entry on april i put a question to him upon a fact in common life which he could not answer nor have i found any one else who could what is the reason that women servants though obliged to be at the expense of purchasing their own clothes have much lower wages than men servants to whom a great proportion of that article is furnished and when in fact our female house servants work much harder than the male what answer would boswell get today jim baillie sale cheshire danny dorling rhetorically asks letters april whether the oxford diocesan school trust is paying parttimers less per hour than full timers and if that is the explanation for their large gender pay gap the answer is obviously yes something we should expect the professor of human geography at oxford to know the gender pay gap being reported currently is the total unadjusted one of all men and women in work and its around the pay gap unadjusted for any other factor among fulltimers only is by the same ons figures that parttimers get lower pay per hour is thus the explanation for some half of that gender pay gap currently being reported isnt it across the entire economy it will be higher in those fields and organisations which employ more than the average proportion of parttimers this is such a well known fact that even those in their ivory towers should grasp it tim worstall senior fellow adam smith institute while theresa may is probably happy to contribute to the anger about the paygap issue it is a welcome distraction for her a blue herring men paid more at of firms april the real battle over womens pay should focus on the gap at the bottom end where millions of workers are paid less than a living wage or even below the legal minimum wage and most of them are women the government could take two easy steps now to improve matters for working women first make firms obey the minimum wage law or better yet ensure that all employees get paid a real living wage giving them enough to live on without benefits if companies were made to pay decent wages the tory austerity agenda could be shelved and millions of lives would be improved it really is that simple david reed london i was buying something and couldnt decide between two purchases i decided to look at each companys gender pay gap and choose the one that paid women the fairest if other women consult the pay gap before deciding where to spend their money we could perhaps move this thing along a bit more speedily lets start a spend where its fair movement janet graves mellor cheshire so after championing the just about managing theresa may has now adopted the gender pay gap as her cause du jour what could possibly go wrong r schuhle pontefract west yorkshire while not wishing to deny a gender pay gap it should be noted that gender gap reporting is on gross income per hour before the effect of tax and benefits so for instance men pay about twice as much income tax as women bn against bn whereas because some women earn less and are more likely to head a singleparent family some women will gain through the benefit system for instance based on an online calculator a single parent working hours a week at an hour with one child under will have their take home pay almost doubled from to the effect of using gross pay instead of income net of tax and benefits therefore seriously overstates the headline gender pay gap figure michael mcguffie wellington somerset your editorial on the gender pay gap april claims that exploitation is what this is about and implies that it reveals a workplace that denigrates its female staff both these statements go beyond the evidence and distort the real problem as you rightly say the survey raises questions about the obstacles to advancement through maledominated hierarchies as well as the broader problem with pay ratios of course management should aim to encourage and promote women wherever possible and overall excessive pay differentials are a central problem for government but it has been the case that many women prefer jobs aimed at looking after individual people rather than committing their energy to playing the organisation game this tendency has been observable both in choosing careers and in accepting promotion into administrative posts and even in the public sector where the objective is in some general sense the public interest this is only a marginal tendency with huge numbers of exceptions and it may well be gradually shifting as a result of cultural change among both women and men but so long as it remains some continuing gap will be neither exploitative nor denigrating such dogmatic language merely antagonises employers who feel misunderstood and defensive alan bailey london join the debate

what began as a trickle became a torrent carving out a new landscape in the world of work with the lastminute flood of data as the gender pay gap deadline hit this week some companies went on the defensive reputation rehabilitation was under way and canny headhunters began to flick through their rolodexes i have heard that a lot of headhunters are now calling senior women and saying would you be interested in a move some of your competitors have got lower gender pay gaps said the gender pay gap consultant and expert helene reardon bond with eight out of companies and publicsector bodies revealed to be paying women less than men and women paid a median hourly rate of an average less than male colleagues it is the genie that wont be put back in the bottle it has changed the working landscape said mark crail content director of xperthr an online advisory service that was inundated with queries from companies as the clock ticked down to april and its very much a reputational issue from the trading floor to the shop floor many women and men have been dismayed not just at the statistics but at their companies responses one vicepresident at an international investment bank told the guardian talk was cheap and while banks have talked about developing women for years the statistics showed no improvement the finance sector has been revealed to have one of the biggest gaps on average at we started out as graduates equal to our male peers as time goes by most men in my peer group have zoomed ahead in their careers and i wonder what makes them so spectacular its like the workplace is a game and men have the cheat sheets she said other women were puzzled at discovering that although they worked in companies with a majority female workforce the gap was still huge puzzlement turned to anger as some companies failed to communicate serious explanations one worker at the fashion retailer coast which reported a median gap was incensed that the only communication was an email personally i am in shock at the pay gap she said pointing out the firm didnt employ many men the email said that two of the retailers three executives were men which they claimed was the main reason for the massive difference in pay no other reasons were given which has left her hugely irritated coast said that its pay gap was the result of the nature of our business it claimed that the difference between male and female pay had come about because the majority of people who want to work for the brand are coast customers themselves and therefore women another employee at a high street optician chain with a median gap of between said there appeared to be no action plan they explained why the gender gap exists in a video blaming women for choosing worsepaid occupations and summing it up with lets face it we will never get rid of the gender pay gap she said a female employee at a clothing company that reported a median pay gap of said whats missing is an action plan we got an internal email which says something vague about action being taken but externally there is no action the data though not perfect offered the first insight into inequality in the workforce on a company level anywhere in the world it may have spawned gendergap deniers and a slew of defensive company statements but labours harriet harman who pushed through the legislation requiring companies with a plus workforce to publish their gender pay data has been clear the transparency is a means to an end as a spur to action one major retailer the john lewis partnership is striving to do just that seeing the exercise as a positive rather than obsess about the figures its median pay gap was which is about the same as others in its sector it has taken it as an opportunity to have a meaningful and constructive dialogue across its partner workforce staff are called partners as they are coowners in the business the company used its communications portals intranet staff magazine and gender equality group to drive debate senior managers have been involved from the getgo like similar retailers there is a majority female population at shop floor level with numbers thinning at the higher levels rather than use this an an excuse or whinge that the method of collecting data was flawed the company has focused on addressing the reasons behind its figures it has provided an opportunity to talk about issues such as more flexible working and barriers to jobsharing at management level said david hopkins an hr manager at the company having to produce its data has set up what should be a positive dialogue as a company you could choose to do that in a positive way and use it as an opportunity or you can set it up as an antagonistic point of contention that is left to fester we have gone for the former he said reardon bond a former civil servant who worked on gender equality policy and is now a expert consultant in the field said companies that failed to address the issue faced massive reputational risk and pressure from shareholders the data highlighted the need to make flexible working for all a priority and in particular in stem science tech engineering and maths

christian muslim and jewish leaders have joined forces to call for a policy limiting benefits to families with more than two children to be scrapped the twochild policy introduced a year ago allows families to claim child tax credits or universal credits only for their first two children unless there are special circumstances but religious leaders say the policy will lead to a rise in child poverty and abortions the policy is expected to tip an estimated extra children into poverty it also conveys the regrettable message that some children matter less than others depending on their place in the sibling birth order they say in a letter to the times there are likely to be mothers who will face an invidious choice between poverty and terminating an unplanned pregnancy the letter was signed by church of england bishops including sarah mullally the new bishop of london and number three in the church the board of deputies of british jews and the muslim council of britain last year the child poverty action group launched a legal challenge to the policy saying it was in breach of human rights and discriminatory it estimated that more than children would be pushed into poverty as a result of the measure by the end of the decade representing a increase in child poverty jewish muslim and catholic organisations have said the policy would disproportionately affect families in their faith groups some of whom have large numbers of children in a coalition of faith organisations said the proposals were fundamentally antifamily anything which sends the implicit message that a

the united reform church the board of deputies of british jews and the orthodox jewish interlink foundation said the department for work and pensions has said the policy will be implemented

equal pay for equal work seems such a stunningly fair concept who could argue against it well in theory no one but the myriad ways not to pay men and woman equally and to divide that work up and redefine certain parts of it as more valuable have now been made visible women it is often said dont want to do the same jobs as men we are too balanced too intelligent too caring to be so driven to even mention pay can be awkward when i first started writing in this newspaper many years ago i was paid less than half the amount that my male colleagues earned i didnt know this until i won a prize and asked for a pay rise things changed at another paper i was told never to disclose my salary as it was more than that of one particularly arrogant male columnist this is only one small industry but the secrecy around earnings is part of the problem when we are trying to work out how the gender pay gap operates now an audit following groundbreaking legislation is forcing companies to disclose their gender pay gaps and so is finally busting open such secrecy its not looking good nor is it straightforward to decipher all the complex reasons for the pay differentials first lets look at the public sector councils government departments schools and hospitals this reveals that on average women are paid less an hour than their male colleagues overall twothirds of councils have pay gaps as do of nhs trusts the gap is defined as the difference in average hourly pay and is then expressed as a percentage of the male earnings one may have hoped that schools and hospitals were places of equality far from it though of the nhs workforce are women there are huge pay gaps for example the queen victoria hospital nhs foundation trust in west sussex had the worst median pay gap with women paid an average p for every a man received threequarters of the trusts staff are women but at the top end of the pay scale the consultants are mostly men in many public sector jobs managers and decisionmakers are predominantly male and wellpaid this carries through to our institutions of higher education every single university in the russell group pays women less on a median hourly rate durham university has the biggest pay gap at disparity at council level is also shocking north hertfordshire district council whose workforce is women and men had the worst median gender pay gap at and i havent even touched on the private sector macquarie gender pay gap karen millen ryanair apple uk some of this is explained away by choice ryanair says not many women want to be pilots but what is happening at the top of ftse companies nhs trusts and councils when the best jobs are going largely to men i have watched this clone recruitment in the media where a young man is promoted over a young woman because he reminds the boss of his younger self men are seen as always more committed to work with their families taken care of sure there may not be jobs for life but there arent that many top jobs for women who create life pregnancy is a sign of wavering commitment despite some advances a womans earnings often drop even if she goes straight back to work after having a baby certainly over her lifetime becoming a parent will penalise her financially this has become more than an issue about equal pay it is about the unpaid care a woman does and how that affects her choices apart from children she may have to look after other family members and this often again means lowpaid parttime work the pay gap therefore is not simply about equal pay for equal work its about trying to minimise the structural inequalities in the system parttime workers need to sign up to unions and we have to stop speaking of parttime work itself as either the destiny of women or as a sign that women are all less ambitious than men how is it right to have highly paid men in top roles being served by women who are themselves penalised for having children what is perceived as a choice for women is not much of a choice highearning women of course can pay others to sort out their family lives at a certain income you can cut out the parental penalty but that is not most peoples lives what is eyeopening about these figures is that the situation in the public sector is not better than it is it too seems to go along with the idea that women dont want top jobs because they are too stressful one can almost hear the braying of the highearning bbc presenters who just believe that men are somehow more entitled to money lack of female ambition is perhaps one part of the explanation but really in every industry in every sector there is much more we can do about equal pay but this is also about socialisation what we think we are worth and how we ask to be paid i think girls need to be taught this in schools for if we carry on as we are we will see these huge pay differentials persist through our lives with many women ending up in dire pension poverty publishing this data is

the deadline of midnight on april has passed and all eligible british companies should by now have reported their gender pay gap almost eight years after the equality act we have data the first of its kind in the world that lays bare the scale of the gender pay gap in private businesses and the public sector the figures reveal men are paid more than women in out of companies and public bodies in britain based on the median hourly pay across the companies and organisations that had filed by am on thursday eight out of had a gender pay gap while the figures do not reflect equal pay for equal work they do raise questions about structural inequalities in the workforce and may hold the answer to closing the gap sucheta nadkarni professor and director of the womens leadership centre at cambridge judge business school says that despite flaws the figures do indicate men are paid more than women on average she said whether it is because women are getting paid less for the work that they are doing or because women are not getting equal opportunities to get into positions where the pay level is high it doesnt matter what the reason is but there is a gender pay gap and in most cases its an issue of equality and justice in both cases its an issue of an imbalance of some sort the figures also highlight which industries pay women less on average the construction sector reported the worst average median gender pay gap at this was followed by finance and insurance at perhaps unexpectedly education a sector predominantly filled with universityeducated women has also fared badly due to sizable gaps across multiacademy trusts the sectors average median pay gap is but women are likely to experience something closer to pay equality in the accommodation and food services sector which has a pay gap however no sector pays women better than men on average another clear take away from the figures is that women are not making it into the boardroom the data shows women are underrepresented in toppaid jobs when compared to the business as a whole in of companies the trend persists even within femaledominated companies for example while the workforce at hsbc bank is female the top earners at the bank are predominantly male but when organisations achieve better representation at the top something interesting starts to happen a guardian analysis of the data shows that in companies where women are fairly or slightly overrepresented in the top pay band the median gender pay gap shrinks relative to the composition of the company as a whole nadkarni who has researched gender diversity in senior management in her work believes gender balance in the boardroom may explain a smaller gender pay gap when men and women work together thats the best dynamic because men become more caring working as part of a team with women and women also become less competitive and much more caring so the idea of putting men and women together is actually a very positive dynamic nadkarni has also observed the trend in her own research what we found out was actually its not about having more and more and more women but its having a balance of males and females which creates the best dynamic and creates a psychologically safe atmosphere then having a more inclusive culture more people speaking up cooperating with each other and caring about each other all of these things become very important the data shows if we are to close the gender pay gap one place to start may be with the toppaid positions in british companies this article was amended on april

as many as sure start childrens centres may have been shut down in england since double the official closure estimates leaving the uks flagship early years programme hollowed out and in decline a study has found according to the sutton trust an education and social mobility foundation a lack of clarity in how individual centres are identified and changes are reported means official figures of closures since are likely to be an underestimate funding cuts mean access to early years provision varies widely across the country while many remaining centres offer only a fraction of the services they once did the trust says hampering social mobility and resulting in thousands of children missing out on vital services the study warns that sure start centres are at a tipping point with further drastic reductions on the way as local authority budgets continue to shrink it says centres are struggling to survive in an environment of declining resources and loss of strategic direction sir peter lampl founder of the sutton trust said goodquality early years provision makes a substantial difference in the development of children especially those who come from the poorest homes it is a serious issue that the services that sure start centres offer are much more thinly spread than they were a decade ago most councils have had to abandon the original sure start ideal of an openaccess neighbourhoodbased facility for parents and preschool children the study says adding services are now hollowed out councils are tending to concentrate their remaining centres which in some cases open only sporadically during the week in the most socially deprived areas some centres no longer focus exclusively on children aged but are open to young people up to the age of others limit provision to families in crisis referred by child protection services these changes take us a long way from what began as a flagship national programme the report concludes the sutton trust said that if the government was serious about social mobility it must reconnect with the original aims of sure start the trust recommends the introduction of national guidance aimed at stopping the piecemeal closures of childrens centres and the publication of a longdelayed review of early years services so far the bulk of the closures have been concentrated in relatively few local authority areas including west berkshire camden stockport bromley oxfordshire and staffordshire which have each shut more than of their centres the study says however in the past few months many more councils have proposed or announced widespread closures such as leicestershire birmingham warwickshire and somerset after closures in northamptonshire some early years services were moved into libraries but now those libraries also face being shut down the studys survey of of the english councils providing childrens social care carried out in autumn found that a fifth planned to reduce the number of childrens centres in the near future with a third expecting significant changes including reductions to services and access the oxford university professor kathy sylva lead author of the report said the wide variation in the level of closures and services on offer was alarming given that the governments own evaluation of sure start had shown childrens centre use had many beneficial effects on families she said at a time of increasing pressure on poor families with young children there is an urgent need for evidencebased services to support them sure start was created and developed under new labour as a way of

almost eight in companies and publicsector bodies pay men more than women it was revealed as the midnight deadline passed for businesses to report their gender pay gap some eight years after the law was tabled to compel companies across great britain to reveal the extent of the difference between male and female wages the data showed that women were being paid a median hourly rate that on average was less than that given their male colleagues by midnight on wednesday companies and publicsector organisations of a total of which had filed had reported a pay gap that was above the national median of the government and the equality and human rights commission said they would not comment on the number of companies and publicsector bodies that were required to report their figures earlier figures from publicsector organisations which had to report their gender pay gaps by march suggested nine in paid men more than women with an overall gender pay gap of more than companies reported their figures in the hours before the deadline more than the total number of companies that had reported in the first days of the scheme companies had to file data based on a snapshot of their payroll taken on april and could file the information at any point after that companies will now have to repeat the exercise on a yearly basis the figures are imperfect the key measure of the median hourly pay gap across an entire business does not address the gap in similar job roles the quality of the data is also patchy and due to exemptions highlevel executives including partners and nonemployed typically lowpaid workers are not included in the data but the datagathering exercise unmatched anywhere else in the world to date reveals structural inequality of opportunity and will force employers to look at the barriers facing womens progression in the workplace according to sam smethers chief executive of the fawcett society its a game changer it forces employers to look at themselves and understand their organisations and it prompts employees to ask some hard questions she said smethers said the interest generated by the reporting requirement was helping women speak out about inequality of opportunity in their workplaces finally women are realising that they have a right to talk about pay and they cannot be silenced by finding out what their colleagues earn they are then in a position to challenge any pay inequality it is much more common than people realise the home secretary amber rudd who is also the minister for women and equalities said there was no excuse for companies not to be transparent and that closing the pay gap made economic sense businesses should see reporting gender pay gap data as just the first step on the road to creating fairer and more equal workplaces across the uk she said they should be putting action plans in place to break down the barriers to womens progression in their organisations the sectors with the largest gender pay gaps were facing difficult questions as the deadline closed with construction finance and insurance and education exposed as the industries with the largest gaps guardian analysis based on organisations own categorisation of their businesses showed that construction had the largest sectorwide gap with an average median pay gap of the gap was in the finance and insurance sector and in education schools particularly multiacademy trusts and some of the countrys bestknown public schools reported huge pay gaps more than multiacademy trusts reported pay gaps of or more accommodation and food services emerged as the sector with the smallest pay gap with an average median pay gap of many firms use flat pay rates with high numbers of staff on the minimum wage which could explain the nominal gap hundreds of recognisable names filed results just before the deadline closed they included apple uk which reported a pay gap the company stated that when all uk employees were taken together the pay gap was in womens favour in the banking sector macquarie corporate holdings reported a gap and macquarie bank in sport millwall holdings the parent of the millwall football club reported a pay gap of in the hours before the deadline in fashion karen millen reported paying women less on a median hourly basis meaning that companywide mens median pay was double that of women women made up of the companys top positions and the same proportion of men and women received bonuses yet womens median bonus pay was lower than mens other names from the high street included victorias secret at and french connection which reported a gap of benefit cosmetics revealed a gap although women made up more than of each pay quartile at the company others to report in the last hours included the construction giants john sisk which revealed a pay gap and just female top earners columbia pictures and warner bros entertainment reported gaps of and respectively three big record labels also recorded significant pay gaps at universal at sony and at warner ryanair reported the worst by some distance gender pay gap in the transport sector at and said of its topearners were male the figures highlight the inequalities between men and womens standing in the workplace but the extent of the lessons learned is limited by the figures the government has requested and the quality of some of the data being filed julian jessop of the institute of economic affairs said the reporting could have unwelcome consequences including creating a feeling of resentment among workers or the outsourcing of lowerpaid femaledominated roles such as cleaning i dont think the data is necessarily telling people what they think it is telling them he said that there is a gender pay gap in favour of women in parttime work for example if not prima facie evidence of discrimination in favour of women but helene reardon bond a gender pay gap expert and former senior civil servant who played a key role in shaping the requirement to report the figures said the significance was monumental the gender pay gap deniers will say that the gap only exists because of the choices women make but while everyone makes choices women make constrained choices she said this is absolutely monumental we have got people from all different industries and walks of life sitting down and talking about this most businesses have never worked out their gender pay gap well now they have the question remains what they will do about it,2018-04,almost eight company publicsector body pay men woman wa revealed

to know the scale of a problem is not always to know its nature but it is a start thanks to data published ahead of a midnight deadline on wednesday a clearer picture is emerging of the extent to which british women are systematically paid less than men this finding reinforces the story told by equivalent public sector data published to a deadline last week the picture is still incomplete only firms with more than employees are compelled to release their data and some have produced numbers that dont add up hundreds left it until the very last minute to comply suggesting embarrassment hope of avoiding scrutiny or a casual attitude to the whole issue organisations should want to close their pay gap not to avoid shame but because a workplace that denigrates the contribution of its female staff errs on commercial as well as ethical grounds exploitation and that ultimately is what this is about demoralises workers and chases away talent analysing the data will take time but the pattern is clear enough about of companies report a medianwage disparity in favour of men some sectors are worse offenders than others with construction and finance companies looking especially unequal with median hourly wage gaps often over of companies that reported on the final day ryanair stood out median hourly pay for women employed by the airline is lower than for men according to the office for national statistics the average pay gap for the uk last year was doubtless the equal pay act nearly years old is still being flouted in some cases but the principal problem is too few women in the highestpaying roles that raises a new set of questions about the obstacles to advancement through maledominated hierarchies a pay gap between women clustered at the lower end of the scale and men nearer the top is also symptomatic of a broader problem with pay ratios the chief executives of ftse companies earn on average about times more than the national median wage of a fulltime worker theresa may has spoken of inherent unfairness in a system that allocates reward so unevenly ahead of todays deadline she described the specific problem of gender pay gaps as a burning injustice the prime minister rightly also highlighted the problem of millions of women not being paid at all nine out of people who are kept out of the labour force due to caring duties are women and it is no coincidence that paid carer roles disproportionately filled by women are among the lowest paid the prejudices that limit and undervalue womens participation in the economy run deep the prime ministers attention to this cause is welcome although as in other matters of economic justice she is more energetic with rhetoric than action the mechanism that has exposed the gender pay gap is not speeches but law invitations to voluntary change are easily rejected and it is human nature for the beneficiaries of any bias to imagine that their privileges are fairly earned that is why evidence of a systemic imbalance is so vital sight of the scale of the problem should make it impossible to ignore although the cavilling tone and the excuses offered by some companies suggest reluctance to face the facts it will take sustained public and political pressure to effect change ensuring that denial is no longer an option,2018-04,know scale problem always know nature start thanks data published

a number of governing bodies across british sport have acknowledged that there is a significant gender pay gap in their organisations though some insist they are taking steps to narrow it figures from the football association show the average hourly pay for a man at the organisation was higher than for a woman the fa said the fact that most of its highprofile coaches were men had a significant impact on the figures it added great work is going on across the country to increase female participation at all levels in the game and over time this will build a better pipeline of talented women to work in managing and governing the game as well as playing it the rugby football union also reported a gender pay gap in the difference between the average hourly wages of men and women it employed the rfu said our pay gaps are due to a higher concentration of men in our senior roles some inside the system believe the problem is largely due to historic reasons because more men have typically gone into sports coaching and organisational roles than women as one put it this isnt to excuse it but there arent enough women in the system so unfortunately we are not going to get more in senior and betterpaid positions overnight yet privately many concede that much more needs to be done to encourage women into the system and to keep them if they have families so they can develop and take on senior roles british cycling in announcing that its gender pay gap had lessened from last april to in december said it believed that the introduction of flexible working hours and enhanced paternity leave was a factor its chief executive julie harrington said that everyone in the organisation should be remunerated fairly regardless of gender harrington said this will need a combination of proactive steps to ensure our recruitment and retention policies further narrow the gender pay gap and provide an inclusive culture with an agile flexible working environment for our people it is the right thing to do and therefore will remain a priority for the organisation i lead unsurprisingly when it comes to athletes pay the difference between men and women remains wide particularly in football due to market forces newcastle united said its gender pay gap was not atypical for the premier league though it pointed out that the gap excluding players and its first team manager was the clubs managing director lee charnley added ours is a sport in which the highest earning roles are occupied almost exclusively by men our gender pay gap reflects this globally the trend is similar with

women like men only cheaper and in we are discovering by just how much the introduction of mandatory reporting has transformed the debate about the gender pay gap from a littlediscussed dry set of statistics directly into staffrooms and workplaces across britain with explosive effect the data shows in black and white just how few women are progressing within organisations across every area of the economy whether in the public or private sector gender still too often predicts pay yet even before all these reports have been made public the backlash against any such scrutiny has begun angry voices decry the gender pay gap saying it doesnt exist or that weve got it muddled with equal pay something entirely different commentators such as jordan peterson invited on to bbc radio s today programme to discuss the gender pay gap on the day of the deadline for companies to report their results claim women dont have the skills to be top executives and dont work the long hours men do so the data is meaningless others say the gap just reflects life choices women have made the mummy pay penalty for women who take breaks to have children or want to work parttime women know your limits and be paid accordingly its telling that these pundits provide no evidence themselves to back up their prejudices because the data there is proves their analysis is opinion not objective fact as the office for national statistics points out women taking time out for childcare only explains some of the variation in pay only of the gender pay gap could be attributed to specific characteristics such as differences in average age job tenure company size and occupation talk of the lack of women in comparable roles also misses the point that women arent in those roles to compare its not that women are incapable of being top executives or working all the hours in the day its that still too often they dont get appointed to do so these ideologically suspect attacks confuse causation with correlation they reinforce social preconceptions that it is women who should sacrifice their careers if they start a family its a view that dominates discussions about flexible pay and in turn the persistent undervaluing of parttime work because thats for those who have given up ambitions for promotion and are earning pin money patriarchy has held us all back for too long with such rhetoric tired old notions that there are boys jobs and girls jobs and that gender dictates ability ryanair defends having a gender pay gap of by pointing out how few women are pilots and how many are cabin crew their chief executive claims it is a feature of the airline industry as though a penis is required to be able to fly a plane yet even such biologically determinate arguments are blown apart by this data in the nhs where of the workforce is female women still only account for a minority of senior leaders it also doesnt explain why even in companies such as marks amp spencer where there is a smaller pay gap the bonuses paid to women are still substantially lower what these arguments do prove is that tackling the gender pay gap isnt just about ensuring that access to shared leave flexible working and job sharing is standard and used by both parents its also about employers and their responsibilities when it comes to recruiting retaining and promoting women in the first place responsibilities that if ignored manifest themselves in pay research shows women ask as often as men for a pay rise yet men are four times more likely to get one that women exhibiting the same leadership skills as men are judged completely differently responsibilities that start early too a year after graduation women already earn on average a year less than their male counterparts in the fight for equality we must not let such voices gaslight women that the gender pay gap is a natural phenomenon instead we must use the data to drive action to bust open such stereotypes about what women are capable of and what kind of worklife balance every employee needs yet there are worrying reports already of women being told to raise a grievance with hr if they ask their managers about this data or that talking about it could make them be seen as troublemakers thats why we started the paymetoo campaign to give practical advice on how to talk about it at work and what rights employees have to do so and show that mps are ready to act if this conversation gets shut down we know that this is not the full story on inequality in the workplace with some companies not including partnership data which is not mandatory and the sole focus being gender and not ethnicity class or disability but we also know this data is telling us what james brown sang that its still a mans world

the uk equality watchdog must be more aggressive to enforce changes that would reduce the size of the gender pay gap harriet harman has said the labour mp a key architect of the equality act which requies businesses with or more employees to reveal the differences in what they pay men and women said that the equality and human rights commission ehrc should set up a series of inquiries and force change ahead of wednesdays deadline for companies to report harman criticised the pitiful excuses that some businesses have given and she said that the ehrc should act as the ofsted of the gender pay gap what we need is for the equality and human rights commission to get in there and force the pace of change the big question is whether they are going to do that she said in a way the ehrc is like the ofsted of the gender pay gap who is in special measures who is outstanding the ehrc has the power ultimately to take companies that fail to report their gender pay gap to court and has repeatedly stressed that while not reporting is unlawful wide pay gaps are not but harman said its focus should not be on illegality but on putting companies with large pay gaps under pressure to take action the critical thing now is not just to look at the figures and go oh thats awful wring our hands and wait for women to bring individual cases or unions to negotiate for incremental change to happen a snails pace she said the ehrc have the power to do inquiries and issue codes of conduct and they have to use those powers they need to do inquiries into particular firms sectors and regions so that people dont just publish their gender pay gap and then get on with pay discrimination as usual large gulfs in pay between men and women have already been exposed among the or so companies the government equalities office estimates to have fulfilled the reporting requirement some are predictable with banks and asset management companies showing big differences such as a median gap of at the barclays international banking group at hsbc at lloyds and a gap at the cooperative bank others less so guardian analysis has suggested that women working in academy school chains suffer some of the worst gender pay gaps in the uk but harman who has spoken about the sexism she has faced since she entered parliament in was not surprised by the figures i always thought the pay gap would be large and i always thought the excuses from management would be pitiful she said and thats exactly what weve got large pay gaps pitiful excuses but we are not interested in the excuses or justifications any more the mother of the house of commons has spoken before about her at the time deeply unpopular insistence that the equality act include a clause requiring companies to be transparent about their gender pay gaps but she batted away an opportunity to talk about her pride in the legislation it has unveiled the particularity and the scale of the problem but the transparency is a means to an end she said what it was never designed for was just to increase the justified resentment and anger of women at pay discrimination weve had the exploding of the gap the exposing of the myths were now in

the government has issued a final warning to businesses to report their gender pay gap by midnight as it emerged the conservative party did not plan to file its own figures until a day after the deadline amber rudd who is the minister for women and equalities as well as home secretary said there was no excuse for businesses not to be transparent as the deadline on wednesday approached and warned them that refusing to report was breaking the law organisations of or more employees have until just before midnight to meet their legal requirement to report their pay gap data to the government or face enforcement action by the equality and human rights commission the conservative party employed fewer than staff last year so it is under no obligation to publish its figures this year but having decided to do so voluntarily party insiders suggested it was strange to leave it until after the deadline one senior tory mp said im pleased that the party is reporting its gender pay gap figures even when it doesnt have to its important that were seen to be leading from the front but its a shame that we didnt decide to do it a bit earlier theresa may has put narrowing the gender pay gap close to the centre of her domestic policy agenda the uk is one of the first countries to require companies to publish their figures with ireland and canada following suit the prime minister has much work to do to tackle the issue on her own doorstep data published by all whitehall departments last december showed that some such as the department for transport where female civil servants are paid almost less than their male colleagues have a long way to go writing in the daily telegraph may said we will have established a baseline from which to hold businesses to account in the future shareholders and customers will expect to see improvements and will be able to hold organisations to account if they fail to achieve them the prime minister also singled out the bbc for the pay gap between its highest paid men and women and said the decision to publish the salaries of its top earners last july started a major culturechange for the corporation businesses will have to update their figures every year the government argues that greater transparency will increase awareness encourage culture change and help close the gap for good within a generation rudd said there is absolutely no excuse for businesses in the private sector not to be transparent about their gender pay gap before the deadline set down in law businesses should see reporting gender pay gap data as just the first step on the road to creating fairer and more equal workplaces across the uk they should be putting action plans in place to break down the barriers to womens progression in their organisations closing the gender pay gap also makes economic sense research shows that improving womens participation in the labour market could add bn to the economy by thats a number we cannot afford to ignore rudds party pointed out it was publishing its own data voluntarily and as such was not filing late conservative campaign headquarters cchq rather than the party as a whole has published figures on its

working in the education department of an irish trade union over years ago i had no difficulty enabling the mostly male shop steward students to get to grips with the idea of men and women doing vastly different jobs being entitled to the same pay angry about the pay gap heres what to do april i would simply ask if this female job were done by men instead how much would they be paid it never failed shop stewards would howl with laughter at the idea of paying men so badly arguments that work dominated by women was less physically demanding or less skilled and so justified lower pay would dissolve as fine motor skills or adeptness in human relations were suddenly found worthy of the male rate today the jobs and industries may have changed but the ideas we need to challenge gender discrimination at work havent why are women still concentrated in the lowerpaid jobs clearly women should have equal access to all current areas of higherpaid work but if men dominated the care industries or the bbcs china correspondent had been a man would employers still be taking it for granted that such male work was worth so little naomi wayne london your article revealed scale of public sector pay gap march gives a misleading impression of pay for nhs consultants implying that there is an implicit gender gap for the record all nhs consultants whether male or female are paid on exactly the same salary scale which is agreed and implemented nationally differences in salaries are explained by multiple factors including the amount of additional work a consultant agrees to do for the nhs over and above their basic contract and additional awards for clinical excellence while it may potentially be the case that a male consultant is more likely to obtain the latter awards than his female colleague the data needs to be analysed and presented in its entirety before making the simplistic assumption that salary differences are the result of gender bias dr stephen vallely consultant radiologist belfast anne davey and kathy winrow of the oxford diocesan school trust odst claim that their trusts have a gender pay gap because we offer employment that is parttime and termtime only letters march but gender pay gaps are calculated according to hourly rates not annual pay so is the odst paying a lower hourly rate to people who work part time as compared with full time andor those who work term time only as opposed to all year round but who otherwise do a very similar job if that is not the reason for the odsts gender pay gap what is the results for thousand of schools and other employers are now available at genderpaygapservicegovuk and vary dramatically from one another those with greater pay gaps should be asked to provide a convincing explanation danny dorling oxford i was recently at the excellent museum of london and was shocked to see a poster from with a picture of a female worker who looked desperate and forlorn with the slogan waiting for a living wage the work of ordinary working people and the contribution they make to the wealth of this country is still not properly recognised the rich get richer and the poor get poorer what possible justification can there be for not paying a real living wage clearly there is money around because this government has given tax cuts to the wealthiest and reduced corporation tax meanwhile the rest

the legal system crashing headlong into metooism provides theatre of an altogether dramatic spectacle on stage we find geoffrey rushs defamation claim against the daily telegraph for its king leer article alleging he behaved inappropriately towards another actor in the sydney theatre companys production of the shakespearian play two years ago rush denies all claims no less commanding is craig mclachlans litigation against fairfax the abc and actor christie whelan browne according to his pleadings before the new south wales supreme court he claims the publications meant he indecently assaulted sexually harassed indecently exposed himself and bullied female cast members during the production of the rocky horror show allegations he rejects accusers have been prompted to come forward about sexual misconduct in the wake of the allegations of lurid conduct by the hollywood film producer harvey weinstein whatever the label timesup metoo balancetonporc women now feel motivated to speak up a number of women also levelled allegations against the former tv personality don burke which he denies craig mclachlan has been the subject of allegations by five women antony catalano the former ceo of domain holdings has gone to his lawyers to reject the financial reviews report that the real estate marketing business was run like a boys club where female employees were made to feel uncomfortable guardian australia had a story that a dayfm executive was fired for allegedly raping a video producer who worked at the radio station the calling out of allegedly predatory behaviour is a global movement the rat on your pig movement in france has had a roiling effect in that country in the united states porn stars and penthouse models are making allegations against donald trump and his extramural trysts in britain the defence secretary fell on his sword so to speak after a series of allegations surfaced including lunging at a female journalists lips after lunch and repeatedly touching another reporters knee maybe some of these outings do not qualify for inclusion within the strict definitional confines of the metoo category the complaint to the sydney theatre company from an actor about geoffrey rush was not an instance of a woman loudly declaring her version of events to the world it only became evident in the defence pleadings that the allegation was made by eryn jean norvill who played cordelia opposite rush we now descend into the abyss of legal technicalities the nsw supreme court defamation judge lucy mccallum in the first preliminary hearing of the mclachlan case pointed to the infinite complexity and ambiguity of sexual and sexualised behaviour the responses range from people who would dismiss the most inappropriate and unacceptable conduct as being only a joke to those of the champions of the metoo movement to the french feminist response to that movement reflected in the statement of the famous french actor catherine deneuve the difficulty also extends to finding the right words to fit the descriptions used by the media for instance the defendants in the mclachlan case unsuccessfully objected to the plaintiffs claim that the publications mean the actor is guilty of indecently assaulting sexually harassing indecently exposing himself to and bullying female cast members it was contended that this rolls up several distinct defamatory meanings which makes it harder to defend mclachlans barrister said that the four kinds of conduct described in the pleading represents a catalogue within a genus justice mccallum thought that the complexity of the language in the fairfax articles and the issues raised defies distillation into a single word or phrase in the rush case which is before the federal court of australia where judges sit without juries justice michael wigney has struck out the telegraphs defence of truth and set aside a subpoena served on the sydney theatre company seeking documents in relation to the complaints laid against rush the judge found the particulars of the truth defence were deficient in relation to the alleged inappropriate touching by rush of norvill the judge said the touch would have occurred on stage observed by hundreds of patrons in circumstances where he had to carry norvill and therefore touch her the judge wanted more details about the touch what exactly was the touch what part of mr rush relevantly touched the actress was it one or both hands or some other part of his body and what part of the actress body was touched what was the nature and duration of the touch justice wigney also thought there might be an innocent explanation for rush to be in the stcs womens bathroom at the same time as norvill the claim is he stood outside a cubicle she occupied until she told him to fuck off the judge questioned whether rush knew she was in the bathroom before he entered if mr rush had another reason for entering the bathroom it might not be able to be characterised as inappropriate he also felt obliged to comment on the motivation behind the telegraphs headlines king leer and stars bard behaviour saying it would seem that the subeditors or whoever it was responsible for the headlines and subheadlines simply could not help themselves nationwide news has flagged its intention to seek leave to appeal against the strikeout decision to be able to replead its defences and to cross sue the sydney theatre company which provided information to the paper on which its story about rush was based if justice wigneys ruling stands then the newspaper and its reporter jonathon moran are in difficulty to have a reasonable prospect of success they need to be able to defend the story on the ground that it was true its true or its nothing is the refrain media lawyers sing all the time that invariably means the complainant will have to give evidence and as we saw in the chris gayle defamation case against fairfax women who blow the whistle are also in for a torrid time in the witness box christie whelan browne one of the complainants in the mclachlan case is now also a defendant as well as a witness in france the creator of that countrys metoo movement sandra muller is being sued for defamation by her former boss who she accused of sexual harassment former fox news employee laurie dhue is suing bill oreilly over claims he made that allegations against him were unfounded she had previously received settlements in relation to oreillys behaviour complainants complain media organisations that publish the complaints are sued the perpetrators complain about their victims and the victims sue the perpetrators this might well be described as an asphyxiating vortex of litigation in a slightly different version on the theme stormy daniels who is a complainant but hardly a victim is suing donald trumps lawyer michael cohen for casting doubt on the veracity of her allegations against the president defamation proceedings are far from a satisfactory way for aggrieved celebrities to regain their footing this is a long complex expensive and risky path to undo the harm in canada patrick brown a conservative politician in ontario accused of sexual misconduct mounted a vehement social media campaign proclaiming his innocence and gave selected interviews to try and rehabilitate his reputation which he said had been damaged by sloppy journalism he is also suing the tv network which broadcast the allegations its interesting that in january following the publication of the allegations against him mclachlan gave an extensive and exclusive interview to the sunday telegraph it was a carefully choreographed piece which didnt press for details about his alleged behaviour the article said there were no restrictions on the interview but citing legal advice the actor would not comment on the specific allegations made against him with his partner orchestra conductor vanessa scammell by his side he conceded he had a benny hill sense of humour but had said he didnt come close in the filth department to other cast members by god i will fight this he added only seven weeks earlier the telegraph published its story about

millions of british women will this week know for certain what they have long suspected that they are working in organisations where men are on average paid much more than them the deadline for reporting the gender pay gap arrives at midnight on april any woman working in an organisation with more than employees can enter their company name into the governments website to see the difference in pay between men and women and find out what proportion of the highestpaid staff members are women it doesnt matter if you work in a high street fashion chain eg coast where the median hourly pay rate for women is lower than for men for a train company bonuses paid to women at west coast trains are smaller than those paid to men or at goldman sachs where womens bonuses are lower than mens youre almost certainly getting less money at jp morgan only of the bestpaid employees are women what should you do if you are a woman working at one of the worstperforming companies is this the week to ask for a pay rise should you go on strike or are there smarter ways to deal with the fury that these figures will likely unleash how terrible is your company look at the data most organisations are just very bad some are shockingly bad study the data to search for warning signs are there more women than men in lowergrade jobs does that proportion flip as you go up the payscale so that there more men than women in highpaid roles what is the bonus gap like remember this isnt about equal pay for equal work a large gender pay gap doesnt necessarily mean your bosses are breaking the law and a small gap doesnt mean there isnt pay discrimination the governments pay gap website shows what the average difference in earnings is across each organisation particularly telling is the section where companies reveal what percentage of the best and worstpaid members of staff are women this should give a clear insight into how committed the organisation is towards promoting women bonuses and performancerelated pay are red flags in firms where it is predominantly men in the senior management roles big bonuses traditionally go to men says scarlet harris womens policy officer at the tuc men are deciding who gets the bonus and they decide what achievement and good performance looks like in a company an old boy network can guide those decisions as well as prejudices about who is the right person to award the bonus to this could also be influenced by presenteeism if a woman has caring issues they might be brilliant at their job but leaving to pick up children join a union this is the first thing women who work in firms with a large pay gap should do says diana holland assistant general secretary at unite the gender pay gap in tradeunionorganised workplaces is smaller than in those where there is no union join a union whether or not your employer recognises one she advises unions can still support and advise you if theres no union get together with other women and document concerns about pay make a plan for the best way to raise this with the most senior people in the company these are really difficult conversations which you might not want to have individually says holland realistically most women in the lowest pay grades arent going to be able to knock on the door of the head of human resources or the ceo and say youve got a problem with your pay gap what are you going to do about it strength in numbers is a good way to go harris says make your bosses feel the heat senior people in the organisation may be feeling embarrassed about the numbers let them know youre angry make sure they are committed to reducing the gap if they are feeling ashamed now is a really good time to ask about flexible work parttime roles and jobshares ask your company if it has done a job evaluation scheme and is it more than five years old holland suggests ask if men and women have equal access to bonuses overtime pensions and other payments are parttime workers paid fairly when compared on an hourly basis has an equal pay audit been carried out these can reveal whether there are different pay rates for men and women doing the same job and if women joining the workplace automatically do so on lower rates than men conducting an equal pay audit will assist your employer in ensuring they are not in breach of the law if they refuse employment tribunals have the power to order them to do so says holland has your company promised to do better interrogate their plans many organisations have published action plans setting out how they will tackle the gap does it feel like a genuine mea culpa with constructive proposals for change if they havent published one feel very worried have they sent out an allstaff email explaining theres a problem and what theyre planning to do they should do that and if they havent thats a sign that theyre not taking this seriously that theyre trying to hide it they need to have come up with an action plan says otegha uwagba author of the career guide little black book a toolkit for working women you need to study the explanation and decide if its convincing or a bit cursory and defensive is the timeline for improvement helpful or are they promising to get to by when youll be retired or dead what are they proposing to do about balance at senior levels have they looked beyond gender to think more broadly about diversity if a company is recruiting diversity to their board after a pay gap fail then you have more chance of change than if you have a bunch of old white men chanting we just want the right person for the job in other words we want to keep hiring people who look and sound like us says sophie walker leader of the womens equality party look out for corporate hogwash the law firm slaughter and may begins its diversity statement piously declaring the principles of equal opportunity and diversity are fundamental to our continuing success but the company goes on to blame its pay gap on its lowpaid female secretaries and in its glossy internal briefing note decides to recalculate the gap once the allfemale secretarial population is removed we endeavour to treat everyone with attention courtesy respect and consideration it says its allfemale secretarial population may disagree so many companies reporting a huge pay gap reach for the same lines of explanation we just have more wellpaid men at senior levels they say they also add this is not illegal if thats the end of their explanation thats very problematic are they saying there are too few women in senior management if so well doh thats the problem they have to solve says ann francke chief executive of the chartered management institute are they also blaming society and saying were in a sector that doesnt attract women that should be cause for alarm they need to redouble their efforts walker adds if your company has announced a pay gap and then said like phase eight did that its simply because men want to work in headquarters and women want to work in the retail outlets then youve got a serious problem because your employers cant or dont want to understand that women are often forced into shaping their working hours around their care responsibilities encourage male colleagues to go parttime none of this will be solved until fathers start taking on more parenting responsibilities oxfam where women are paid less than men realises this and in its action plan says we are introducing enhanced shared parental pay for partners aimed at encouraging more men to take time out for childcaring responsibilities a good sign of how seriously a company takes equality in the workplace is how seriously it takes childcare policies particularly paternity leave so that men can take time off without being shamed by a macho culture of presenteeism as well as flexible working and leave for carers of elderly and disabled relatives says walker ask for a promotion across the board the gender pay data shows that women are overrepresented in the lower pay quartiles and underrepresented in the top pay band because unequal pay is illegal its quite possible you are being paid the same as the men on your level but havent been promoted enough if you work at a company such as coast which describes itself as a brand which designs clothes for women who want to look beautiful feel amazing and stand out where there are women and just men you might be less amazed and more annoyed that mens bonuses are higher than womens and their salaries higher the company says this is because there are more men in head office and recalculates the gap removing head office but it still pays women less than men a disparity it perplexingly describes as far healthier if i were working in a shop and i knew that the men in head office were getting paid a lot more i would be asking my bosses how i could progress to working in the head office and what job evaluation has been done to confirm that jobs in head office are more valuable harris says ask for a pay rise but be clever about it you could just go in and say im massively underpaid fix it it just may not be the most effective way to do it francke says instead she suggests spending time creating a detailed achievement log chronicling your recent successes if a request for a rise is turned down she says you need to ask what do i need to do to get promoted in the next six months or say i want to plot with you how to achieve partnership my view is that being firm and constructive is better than being belligerent but you have to be firm or you risk being fobbed off gather as much comparative data as possible before asking see if colleagues will share details or give you a ballpark idea of what they are paid find out what other organisations are paying people of your level sam smethers chief executive of the fawcett society says the only way to know if you are being paid fairly is to ask for specific pay information to be shared or to act yourselves and share your own pay data once you know about any comparisons then you can be in a position to ask for a pay rise we just have to talk about pay some research suggests that women do regularly ask for pay rises but dont get them as often as men do there are double standards about assertive women not being looked on as favourably as assertive men you have to put that to one side and realise yes not everyone is going to like you for asking for more money but if the pay rise is important to you you have to grit your teeth and do it says uwagba this article was amended on april to remove a

thousands of pinball kids are being shifted around the care system and between schools putting them at risk of being excluded groomed and recruited into gangs the childrens commissioner for england has said almost children in care had to deal with a change of home school and social worker all in the space of a year in according to the commissioners annual stability index which tracks the experiences of children in care it shows that more than children had to move home at least four times in the past two years and about moved home five or more times in the space of three years every day i hear from pinball kids who are being pinged around the care system when all they really want is to be settled and to get on with normal life said the childrens commissioner anne longfield these children need stability yet far too many are living unstable lives in particular children entering care in their early teens this puts them at greater risk of falling through the gaps in the schools system and opens them up to exploitation by gangs or to abuse now in its second year the index found education was frequently disrupted with children in care moving schools midyear to new schools which were miles away on average four hundred children ended up missing a whole term as a result while children did not appear to be enrolled at school at all these children may be temporarily out of school perhaps because of a placement or school move and reentering school midyear or they might have previously been in school but now left state education or they might have never been enrolled the index reported the commissioners advice line for children in care help at hand receives calls from children who are being moved around the system against their wishes or best interests one yearold boy was suddenly moved by the local authority without being told why or where he was going despite the fact he had just secured a school place after months out of school another child who had been placed in a childrens home near to his grandmother and school was then moved to a placement several hours away with no plan for a new school there are more than children in the care of local authorities and the figure is rising longfield said the index which is based on data provided by councils showed most children in care were being supported in stable foster families and schools but a significant minority were changing home and school too often she expressed particular concern about hundreds of children in care who were being shunted from one poor school to another even though lookedafter children are supposed to be given priority in school admissions teenagers children with additional behavioural or emotional needs and those in pupil referral units generally for excluded pupils were the most likely to experience instability longfield said there had been little change in the findings since last years index over one in five children in care are not in the good or outstanding schools they should be and i am worried that the system has given up on the hundreds of children bouncing around from one poor school to another she said i want all local authorities to make reducing instability a priority and to measure it i would also like to see ofsted assessing the stability of children in care as part of their inspections and for the department for education to start asking for data on this in their annual returns from local authorities the care system does work for many thousands of children but our ambition should be for every child growing up in care to have the same chances to live happy healthy and rewarding lives as any other child we put that at risk if we are expecting some children to constantly change school and home,2018-05,thousand pinball kid shifted

victims of domestic violence continue to be crossexamined by their abusers in family courts more than a year after the government promised to stop such ordeals a report has found childrens lives were being put at risk because victims were not being given safe or fair hearings according to the study by womens aid and queen mary university of london survivors reported they were repeatedly not believed blamed for experiencing abuse and seen as unstable by judges barristers and cafcass children and family court advisory and support service officers one woman said her abusive expartner was able to crossexamine her about her sexual history during child contact proceedings almost a quarter of survivors surveyed said they had been crossexamined by their abusive expartner three in five said there was no special protection such as separate waiting rooms different entryexit times screens or video links despite the domestic abuse allegations more than two thirds reported their abusive expartner had also been emotionally abusive towards a child while said children had been physically abused nonetheless unsupervised contact with an abusive parent was the most frequent outcome in cases sampled by the report the extent to which women were being harassed in secretive court hearings was revealed in a guardian report in featuring research by womens aid it triggered a debate that eventually led to the then justice secretary liz truss pledging in february to ban the humiliating and appalling practice womens aid is calling for the government to commission an independent inquiry into the family courts to tackle the failings shazia choudhry a professor of law at queen mary said there is evidence of the family courts failing in their responsibility to prevent and investigate acts of violence towards these survivors and facilitating or failing to challenge a climate of gender discrimination within the courtroom the findings of this research are deeply concerning and require urgent attention from both the judiciary and the legal profession katie ghose the chief executive of womens aid said the government urgently needed to meet its commitment to ban the practice for far too long survivors have endured continued abuse at the hands of their abuser in the family courts she said enough is enough we want to see the family courts protect survivors during the court process and ensure that survivors are able to access their right to a fair and just legal process we know that perpetrators of domestic abuse are using the family courts to continue to control and abuse victims and that the family courts failure to consistently safeguard survivors and apply fairness during the court process is enabling that abuse a ministry of justice spokesperson said we will legislate to ban the unacceptable practice of abusers crossexamining their victims in the family court as soon as possible the law is clear that the childs welfare is paramount and it is for judges to determine what is best for the child after careful consideration of the facts in each case victims views the judge allowed him to be abusive catherine not her real name said she was shocked at being questioned by her expartner against whom she had a restraining order i felt so ill having to sit there and go through it she recalled he was following his own agenda and asking me about previous boyfriends and my sex life things that were completely irrelevant to what we were discussing half of what he was asking me he should never have been able to inquire about but the judge was telling me to answer the district judge allowed him to be very abusive he called my barrister a slag i think the judge had become desensitised and was used to the abuse the final result was indirect contact because my child didnt want to go to him im still living in fear that he will find me one day i have had to move homes at great expense i heard recently that he had attacked his current girlfriend this crossexamination is still going on in the family courts it would never happen in the criminal courts it beggars belief its absolutely horrendous he believed he could still control me claire throssell lost both her sons jack and paul when her exhusband set fire to their home and killed himself during an unsupervised visit after their marriage ended beforehand she had to go to court to resolve contact issues when i was in court he was allowed to hurl insults she said he called me all the names under the sun and the judge allowed this to happen i had a solicitor representing me my exhusband didnt he was aggressive believing he could still control me and that it was his right its a really traumatic experience you are fighting to get your childrens voices heard as it stands now there are women in refuges and theres nothing to stop a perpetrator following them from court back to the refuge i think its a question of cost its even harder for families to get access to legal aid now they should have separate waiting rooms so that the victim and perpetrator dont have to sit outside the courtroom in the same small space im still getting people contacting me saying they are having horrific experiences in court things have to change i lost my sons three and a half years ago jacks voice was never heard in court he would have said he didnt want contact with his father it

after finishing my undergraduate degree i lived for a few months in a small terraced house in what was then a rundown part of sydney next door lived a couple with young children it wasnt long before we noticed a pattern of violence once a week shouting and crying and sometimes when things got really bad a police car arriving at the house this was usually on friday nights when the man of the house came home late and drunk i had grown up in a fairly sheltered family environment in a leafy suburb in that same city i found this experience of violence confronting obviously nowhere near as confronting as it must have been for the woman and the children next door what could i do to help was there any way to stop it id see her on the street smile at her pretend we knew nothing i was only young then i wouldnt do that now id seen violence at university of course drunk boys punching one another fighting over minor things when alcohol clouded their judgment drunk boys who would make unwelcome advances to women drunk boys whod been socialised into believing that men could settle differences with their fists sign up to receive the latest australian opinion pieces every weekday living in such close proximity to that weekly eruption of violence in the cramped little terrace house next to ours made me wonder what might have been happening behind the closed doors of houses in the suburb where id been raised i had already learned when i was young that not all marriages were happy and that many survived only because there was no easy way of getting out so what went on when the blinds were closed and the curtains drawn would we ever have known if someone was getting knocked around in one of those detached houses probably not thinking about these questions led me to decide one day that i would write about middleclass domestic violence but before i began i wanted to investigate how widespread was this was and if literature had anything to say on the topic as a social scientist as well as a novelist im interested in statistics and it seems there is plenty of information available about the extent of domestic violence in australia one in six women has experienced physical andor sexual violence by someone known to them over months on average a woman is killed every week by a current or former partner these are staggering statistics yet i found it difficult to find any information about how the pattern of domestic violence was distributed across the affluent and the less affluent the middle and the working classes this is in spite of the fact that more women from all backgrounds are standing up against sexual violence and it is being widely reported in the media with the metoo movement and every week new revelations about violent middleclass men i went searching for more information from academics and psychotherapists such as susan weitzman who work in this field the general consensus is that abuse in middleclass households is still underreported for a variety of reasons partly relating to social mores and partly relating to how statistics are collected the guilt or shame that many abuse survivors feel is especially prevalent among the more affluent who have been conditioned to believe its a lowerincome problem associated with the stress of poverty but poverty isnt the only correlate of domestic abuse perhaps the belief that domestic violence is a lowerincome problem has arisen because poorer women are more likely than their richer counterparts to access refuges and social services that target abuse survivors in contrast affluent survivors are not only more able to afford to take privately financed routes out of an abusive relationship but are also more able to afford a good lawyer hence information about wealthier abused survivors is not collected or is underreported by serviceproviders and fewer police callouts or restraining orders for domestic violence incidents are recorded what does literature have to say about the phenomenon workingclass domestic violence is a common theme in modern literature as anyone who reads fiction will know but there is very little that covers middleclass domestic violence of course there are exceptions some novels that address this head on such as liane moriartys big little lies but if as margaret atwood once said novels exist not just for private expression but also for social examination there clearly is more to be said on the subject in australia the crisis support service lifeline is on and the national family violence counselling service is on in the

americas birth rate has fallen to a year low let the handwringing and fingerpointing begin its those selfish women wanting careers before kids or gasp not wanting kids at all its all those abortions its obamas fault the reality is for all its profamily rhetoric the us is a remarkably harsh place for families and particularly for mothers its a wellknown fact but one that bears repeating in this context that the us is one of only four countries in the world with no governmentsubsidized maternity leave the other three are lesotho swaziland and papua new guinea countries that the us doesnt tend to view as its peer group this fact is met with shrugs from those who assume that companies provide maternity leave only do and of those just offer full pay during maternity leave this assumption also ignores the fact that of the american workforce a number expected to surpass in the next years are contract laborers with no access to such benefits that gig economy you keep hearing so much about with its flexible schedule and independence yeah it sucks for mothers that doesnt stop companies and pundits from pushing it as a great way for working moms to balance children and career as a gigeconomy mother myself i can tell you exactly how great and balanced it felt to go back to work two hours after giving birth if they return to work mothers can look forward to an increasingly large pay gap for every child they have plus fewer promotions who could resist the option for one parent to stay home with kids is increasingly not economically viable for american families either a data point that got far less attention than the falling birth rate was released by the bureau of labor statistics last month of american mothers with children under are in the workforce now its not just because they want to be not that theres anything wrong with that but increasingly because they have to be in order to support the family think millennials are our problem shirking their breeding responsibilities because theyre too busy taking selfies show me your alltime low birth rate and i will raise you an alltime high student debt load it hit tn this year millennials have an average of in student loans when they graduate a fact that has been blamed for their recordbreakingly low home ownership generation z wont be much help either given that about of them are expected to default on their college loans when they cant find jobs according to brookings lets see what else is at an alltime high credit card debt it hit tn in the us for the first time this year childcare costs are another recordbreaker according to the economic policy institute in states and the district of columbia infant care costs exceed the average cost of instate college tuition at public fouryear institutions the few companies that offer discounted onsite daycare have found that it more than pays for itself in tax breaks and retention and recruitment boosts but its still rare in the fortune only offer any sort of onsite daycare the us has flirted with the idea of subsidized daycare a few times but a longstanding cultural notion that there is something inherently shady about daycare has kept us from ever really doing it except during the second world war when we needed women to work perhaps if the birth rate gets low enough we can get over our collective daycare aversion guess what else is at an alltime low pay raises despite economic growth since the s the hourly inflationadjusted wages received by the typical american worker have grown only per year which is basically nothing guess what though worker productivity hit a threeyear high in in the midst of the harsh economic reality facing parents and wouldbe parents in america is a looming physical threat climate change as the president and his epa head parrot talking points from the fossil fuel industry pointing to volcanoes and natural temperature cycles as the culprits for warming temperatures the global scientific community tells us that we have essentially run out of time to do anything about it that any children we have will be at a higher risk of dying in a super storm or a massive fire that because a small handful of men decided that their own profits and comfort were more important than the rest of the worlds safety any new humans that join the world will face greater challenges than the generation

nobody likes being played its especially galling when you know from the getgo that youre being set up but when youre asked in grave tones by a social worker if youll take in your grandchild because their mum or dad your son or daughter isnt providing a safe home then for most people its a request thats impossible to refuse especially if the alternative is foster care or most upsetting of all adoption no matter that you suspect your local authority is desperate to get this child off its hands on the cheap whatever the deal on the table the deep emotional connection you have with a child youve loved since it was a baby means youll most likely suck it up welcome to the world of special guardians these are relatives or sometimes friends appointed by the family court to care for a child when its parents cant but with it now costing over to raise a child from birth to there are few who could easily afford such an unplanned expense especially in their later years so you might think that if youre asked by childrens services to bring up someone elses child youd be entitled to financial support from the state you might reasonably expect a good deal of practical help even some moraleboosting emotional support when times get tough as they swiftly will if you have to give up your job to look after a toddler or move house to gain an extra bedroom for siblings whove just arrived on your doorstep or negotiate visits with a childs distressed and angry parents who may not appreciate the fact that youre now in charge but think again for of the children being looked after by family or friends in england theres no entitlement to any statutory support and a report just published by the local government and social care ombudsman shows that local authorities are comprehensively failing special guardians and crucially the vulnerable children they care for last year special guardians raised formal complaints about their treatment by their local authority the ombudsman upheld of these grievances and found that social work teams were giving special guardians poor advice where financial support was offered some councils had calculated it wrongly arbitrarily cut the allowance or failed to tell special guardians that this money was periodically up for review rather than payable throughout the time the child was a minor because the vast majority of children looked after by family and friends are entitled to nothing these children have to date been a discretionary line on a fast depleting budget because there is no obligation to help them quite simply councils dont if youre a special guardian whos been having a few quid flung at you count yourself lucky it may not last for long i interviewed the adult sister of a sevenyearold boy whos been told her special guardian allowance of per week is being cut to nothing this summer she gave up her job to care for her brother and shell be looking after him for the next years but on what a retired civil servant told me his local authority was cutting the allowance for looking after his two stepgrandchildren by a year despite the boy having special educational needs they have never received the equivalent of what a foster carer would get so this family is already saving the state a year in fostering fees if this man and his wife hadnt stepped in when crisis hit these two children would undoubtedly be in vastly more expensive foster care and very possibly split up from each other but what were they going to do say no talk to any special guardian and theyll say that they could not in good conscience have made a different decision even knowing the immense financial and emotional toll it would take but the ethics of this situation stink highly vulnerable children are being palmed off by the state with nothing like the support theyd be entitled to if a family member or a friend hadnt made immense sacrifices to care for them but special guardians are ever so easy for local authorities to ignore as they grow up they do far better than kids raised in longterm foster care but its also clear that the people who look after them are often too beaten down to fight for a better deal than the one theyre told is all theyre going to get though every kinship carer ive ever spoken to adores the children they look after they know full well theyre being taken for mugs but theyre not mugs theyre the best of us they deserve better than this cynical exploitative deal where the state makes plain that its support for vulnerable children is an option not a duty and takes advantage

one of australias major family violence services is under investigation by victorias department of health and human services amid allegations of bullying and an organisational culture of intimidation control and mistreatment safe steps based in victoria is one of three organisations from around the country which won the tender to provide the specialist counselling component of the respect national family violence and sexual assault helpline it is also the states hour family violence support service and aids women and children in urgent need sign up to receive the top stories in australia every day at noon a former senior manager at safe steps told guardian australia she had refused to take orders from her bosses to tell staff to change the colour of their hair or wear more appropriate clothing she said there was no dress code at the organisation and yet even unpaid volunteers were scrutinised for their clothing choices there are two investigations under way here said the woman who still works in a senior position within the sector one investigation is being run by the department following a critical mass of complaints about the ability of safe steps to provide services she said the other is the union investigation into bullying she added there are still good people doing good work at safe steps thats why its so hard to speak up we dont want to be putting each other and the sector down but this is a situation where you have an organisation that is supposed to protect women bullying them in their own workplace the chief executive of safe steps annette gillespie denies the allegations made against the service and told guardian australia that the department of health and human services was not conducting an investigation but rather a periodic midfundingcycle review which she said was done for all organisations receiving government funding an increased focus on the sector meant the government wanted to ensure organisations like safe steps had the capacity and funding to meet growing demand she said adding that many family violence organisations were struggling to serve all of the women and children in need of support she welcomed the review and put the complaints raised by the union down to a disgruntled former staff member she also said she had met union representatives after the union detailed the investigation last month in its newsletter we did agree that we have a commitment to working together and developing a trusted relationship gillespie said however in a letter written to the safe steps board the former senior staffer claimed that during an exit interview with the chief executive and no one else present she raised specific examples of bullying towards herself and her staff by two members of the senior management team on a daily basis staff and myself were subjected to behaviours from these women such as undermining interference with practice decisions and negation of these outside of their designated role aggressive outbursts including physical gestures tantrums the letter said the union representing the sector the australian services union told guardian australia that members had concerns about the culture at safe steps we have raised a number of matters in recent times and understand the department of health and human services are aware of our concerns a union spokesman said guardian australia has spoken to many senior people in the sector who confirm the issues plaguing safe steps but will not speak on the record because of fears of bringing the sector into disrepute and the need to secure funding and because they have to liaise with senior safe steps staff members but they have confirmed that the departments focus on safe steps is more than a standard review and has been prompted by ongoing concerns specific to the organisation former staff have also told guardian australia about problems safe steps has retaining staff and about an allegedly toxic workplace culture that includes claims of bullying in a newsletter sent to members the union welcomed news that the health department was investigating safe steps and called for submissions from members no organisation or service provider should be able to accept government money whilst demonstrating a disregard for their industrial obligations or their duty to ensure they deliver the best service possible to the vulnerable members of our community they are there to support the newsletter said agencies that take money but ignore their responsibilities need to be held to account a submission sent by a former safe steps staff member to the union to help inform the departments investigation alleged that leadership ridiculed staff behind their backs and exercised overt control over staff relationships gillespie said she had been shocked to hear that staff had complained of bullying within the organisation and that being contacted by guardian australia was the first time she had heard the allegations she added that exit interviews were routinely conducted by the safe steps people and culture team despite the unions welcoming of an investigation the department of health and human services would not confirm that a formal investigation was under way the department is monitoring safe steps to ensure that the service is wellplaced to deliver the highest quality of support to clients a spokeswoman said safe steps and the department have a shared interest in ensuring the highestquality support services to vulnerable women and children experiencing family violence another former staff member told guardian australia she had approached the safe steps board six months after leaving the organisation to raise her concerns when i left i needed counselling she said i was a shell of myself and it took me six months to go to the board but when i did they said they couldnt help me because i no longer worked there there was only one manager within the organisation she felt she could trust she said and for this reason she and other staff were reluctant to raise concerns while working there it was a toxic environment she told guardian australia we werent allowed to socialise or talk casually it was a revolving door of staff anyone who bucked the system was performancemanaged out the high staff turnover was raised many times in board meetings it was always dismissed as just being the nature of the crisisresponse industry guardian australia has contacted the office of the minister for family violence natalie hutchins for comment this request was passed on to the minister for housing martin foley foley described the investigation as a performance review of safe steps and told guardian australia it would not be appropriate to comment further one of the outcomes of a performance review can be the termination of a

some local authorities routinely flout the law by failing to provide appropriate levels of financial support to carers who do the right thing by becoming legal parents to child relatives the local government watchdog has said inquiries by the local government and social care ombudsman revealed that councils were paying special guardians at less than the legal rate often incorrectly calculating allowances then changing and cutting them without consultation after one case investigated by the ombudsman a local authority agreed to make backdated payments to more than carers after systematically and unlawfully underpaying them over a sixyear period despite being alerted early on to their error campaigners who say the chaotic and inconsistent nature of state support too often leaves carers in poverty welcomed the report and called on ministers to take action to ensure that councils were able to ensure that special guardians were fairly and consistently treated special guardians are relatives and friends who have done the right thing by children who would otherwise be in care system too often local authorities ride roughshod over their and the childrens needs taking advantage of these carers good nature and lack of knowledge of the system said cathy ashley chief executive of family rights group the ombudsman michael king said it is imperative that these children and their guardians get the right support available to them and without having to fight the system to get what they are entitled to special guardianship orders are an alternative to foster care and adoption under which children unable to be looked after by their birth parents are legally put into the care of grandparents older siblings or friends often known as kinship carers around children in the uk are looked after in this way councils are expected to help meet the needs of special guardians including providing financial support counselling and advice they are supposed to pay meanstested allowances to carers in line with fostering fees and meet any extra costs relating to the special needs of the caredfor child however the ombudsmans report based on detailed investigations into complaints during twothirds of which were upheld has confirmed that too often councils were not only underpaying carers but were failing to provide promised support and giving inaccurate advice an intervention by the ombudsman forced north tyneside council to agree to make backdated payments to at least carers after it emerged that its financial support for special guardians was just of the rate it paid to foster carers it had been alerted to this breach of the law in but failed to change its policy until the council subsequently tried to limit the backdated payments to but the ombudsman successfully insisted that they be backdated to november saying that it was impossible that it could not have known of the error after this date north tyneside refused to say how much the total bill for back pay would be but council documents estimate the future added cost of paying special guardians at the legal rate to be an extra a year a spokesperson for the council said we have fully revised the way in which we calculate allowances and are writing to all special guardians to explain the changes that we have made in light of the findings of the ombudsman last month the government scrapped its policy of withholding benefits from kinship carers who fall foul of the twochild limit weeks after a judge declared it to be perverse and unlawful lucy peake chief executive at the charity

ask any parent of young children about what worries them financially and childcare will likely be near the top of the list costs have risen seven times faster than wages in some parts of the country much of the political debate has therefore focused on how to pay for it how many hours parents should get for free and the extent to which government should be subsidising the costs thats an important question but its wrong to focus on that to the exclusion of who is actually providing all this childcare the collapse of the outsourcing giant carillion earlier this year shone a fresh light on the extent of privatisation weve seen across some parts of the public sector childcare is no different twenty years ago most statefunded childcare was either provided by local councils or by the community nurseries that they funded through grants since then the forprofit childcare market has burgeoned small community nurseries have struggled to cope with the shift away from government grants towards giving subsidies directly to parents which has created new risks for them and the last labour government introduced legislation that explicitly discouraged local councils from providing childcare if it could be left to the market today the private sector accounts for of childcare for children aged three and under with a growing number of private nursery chains as demand for childcare has grown big companies have increasingly been muscling in one recent market research conference discussed the hot market of childcare and its investment opportunities the marketing hype the investment portfolios the high expectations of prompt financial return this is the uneasy business environment in which companies gamble on childcare profits at the aforementioned conference one leading portfolio investment company claimed to have a list of buyers from countries seeking to invest in childcare private equity and foreign investment is becoming more significant and the low pound and expanding government subsidies are likely to stoke interest further whats happened in the older care market should provide a cautionary tale there has been a similar shift from the public to the private sector and private equity has become an increasingly important player private equity funds have bought up large chains of care homes and loaded them up with unsustainable debt this led to the collapse of southern cross back in and more recently left four seasons on the brink of breakdown we havent yet seen the collapse of a major nursery provider here other countries have in australia abc learning then one of the worlds largest private childcare providers went into liquidation back in as a result of burdening itself with debt while chasing aggressive expansion it was simply too big to fail the australian government had to provide a bailout of millions to keep the nurseries running until new buyers took over many of the big nursery chains operating here in the uk have ambitious expansion plans which involve buying out and refinancing smaller nurseries for example busy bees has been involved in takeover and consolidation bids in australia singapore and the netherlands it is also trying to attract chinese investors and is launching a chain of nurseries in china nurseries collapsing is not the only risk another is the growth of an increasingly twotier system with access to the best childcare being limited to the richest families the poorestquality nurseries are already disproportionately found in the poorest areas this may be further amplified by privatisation the bigger chains have an explicit strategy of targeting good quality residential areas for expansion in contrast poorer areas tend to be dominated by smaller shortlived nursery businesses there is also an issue around size the community nurseries of the s and s tended to be small rarely larger than children it is not uncommon to find industrialsized privatesector nurseries catering for more than children providing considerable economies of scale for their owners yet the research on young children in nurseries emphasises the importance of continuity familiarity and consistency of care for very young children and parents preferences for very local stable provisionultimately the government today sees childcare as a consumer market rather than a social good or a collective public service with parents regarded as individual consumers buying childcare for themselves many nurseries are now owned by companies that manage them at considerable remove there is often no expectation that parents will be able to influence the way nurseries are run or financed or make suggestions about their daily routines other than to voice concerns or complaints relating to their own individual child its right we invest significant amounts of taxpayers money into childcare but the reason for doing so is not just that parents can go back to work but that through highquality childcare and early education children from disadvantaged backgrounds get a boost to their learning before they start school back when local councils directly funded nurseries there was at least some democratic accountability for how public money was being spent but now that subsidies are channelled via individual parents there is too little oversight for how bn of taxpayer money is being used to help give children the best possible start in life instead the care of young children has increasingly become a commodity to be bought and sold helen penn is an academic and writer specialising in childcare and

choking seems to be in fashion and i dont mean the type where you need the heimlich maneuver since the metoo movement were learning just how many men seem to see choking women as a legitimate form of sex play as it is often euphemistically referred to in porn eric schneiderman new york states attorney general who announced he was pursuing a lawsuit against harvey weinstein for what he described as despicable behavior was just forced to resign after four women accused him of choking them as well as other types of physical assault schneiderman disputed the allegations claiming that he had only consensual sexual relations as more and more stories surface thanks to the metoo movement women are trying to make sense of why so many men are sexually abusive and get aroused by abusive acts such as choking for feminists who research porn this is no surprise the domestication of the internet and the introduction of the smartphone made porn affordable anonymous and accessible the main drivers of demand pornhub the most traveled porn site in the world boasts in its annual year in review that it had approximately billion visitors in which translates into about million per day pornhub claims that a total of petabytes of data was streamed in which makes for gb per minute and gb per second to put this in perspective pornhub claims that this is enough data to fill the storage of all of the worlds iphones currently in use when you click on pornhubcom youll find at the top a tab marked categories the user has over of these to choose from some of the most popular being milf teen stepmom and step sister what you wont see is a category called choking because this form of sexual violence is one of the most common acts across all categories women are choked with anything from a penis to a fist to the point of gagging and in some cases almost passing out the victim obviously cant speak during these acts because she is choking so it is typically not until the end of the scene that she says often in a hoarse voice how much she loved it meanwhile she looks exhausted upset and in some cases distraught in mainstream media targeted to women choking or breath play as it is often referred to is rebranded as edgy hot sex that somehow gives the woman power womens health magazine recently promoted the act suggesting it can be an exhilarating experience for some people while the article does admit it could lead to death it nonetheless provides some handy tips for those women squeamish at the thought of this hot sex learning to relax is one recommendation the authors quote a sex therapist who manages to flip the power dynamics by arguing that the turn on is that he is prepared to do anything to have you and the result is that you feel you have an erotic power over him time for a reality check data from studies on domestic violence indicate that the women most at risk of being murdered by their partners are those who were choked frontline activists who work with battered women say that while the batterer calls it choking it is in many cases actually strangulation of these women up to will experience nearfatal strangulation by their partner being strangled damages the womans throat and makes breathing swallowing coughing and talking difficult when the batterer takes it a few step further loss of consciousness can occur within to minutes death within minutes not all batterers got the idea of choking a woman from porn but over years of research shows a connection between viewing porn and violence against women a recent metaanalysis of studies between and from seven different countries concluded that pornography consumption is associated with an increased likelihood of committing acts of verbal or physical sexual aggression regardless of age in a study of us college men researchers found that of them reported seeing mainstream pornography further these men were more likely to say they would commit rape or sexual assault if they knew they wouldnt be caught than men who hadnt seen porn in the previous months without the brave voices of the women who made the metoo movement possible eric schneiderman would likely still be new york states attorney general it is ironic that as women are speaking out loud and clear the porn industry together with mainstream pop culture is promoting choking in so many ways choking women is a perfect metaphor for how women have been silenced women cannot speak the truth of their lives as long as men have their hands round our necks or their penises down our throats as women continue to build this movement the research and the testimonies of women hurt by porn need to be front and center a cultural context for understanding why men sexually abuse women at the levels they do ironically provides us with hope

awen cultural trust runs community centres projects for adults with disabilities as well as theatres libraries and a park in and around bridgend wales it employs people making it exempt from having to publish its gender pay gap figures but it has done so voluntarily we have chosen to be open and transparent about the issue of gender pay equality within awen and will strive to work towards making any improvements to redress the balance where we can says richard hughes chief executive of awen cultural trust its figures show that womens median hourly rate is higher than mens awen is one of only organisations with fewer than employees that has chosen to report its gender pay gap figures of these only were charities greenpeace uk also voluntarily disclosed to the government last month revealing a pay gap in favour of men some small charities published their figures independently not to the government they include the national council for voluntary organisations which has a gap in favour of men an analysis by the guardian of the largest charities in the uk by income fundraising or employees shows that female employees typically earn only p for every a man does however the figures which exclude organisations such as religious ones private schools museums and leisure centres with charitable status compare favourably with companies and the public sector while the median hourly gender pay gap in charities is in favour of men it is in the public sector and for all the companies who have reported although of the largest charities had a gap favouring men had a gap favouring women and nine of these pay gaps were less than in addition charities declared a zero pay gap they include the youth hostels association scope and rethink yet organisations had pay gaps above the national average and three were in excess of the biggest was at the animal charity pdsa where its median gap means that women only earn p for every that men do even though its workforce is female among health and social care charities the average median pay gap was however sexual health charity marie stopes international declared a gap of in favour of men despite women comprising twothirds of the senior leadership caroline james nock vicepresident and hr director at marie stopes attributes the large gap to the fact that most surgeons and anaesthetists working in its clinics are men while nearly all its nurses and healthcare assistants are women although there is also a gap in nonclinical international support roles our ambition is to close the gender pay gap of in our global support office and we are already exploring ways to do that says nock the gender pay gap within uk clinical roles will require coordinated and longerterm thinking across the sector she says other health and social care charities with significant pay gaps are cancer research uk the alzheimers society and the stroke association at the other end of the spectrum the british heart foundation has a median gender pay gap of in favour of women the bestperforming charitable sector overall was disability here almost half of charities declared a gap of less than in either direction in contrast housing charities were a mixed bag with crisis and st mungos reporting a zero and pay gap respectively while shelter declared and centrepoint and among older peoples charities age uk and the extracare charitable trust have the worst figures most childrens and family charities reported gaps of less than but the childrens society declared a gender pay gap in favour of men for international aid charities the highest pay gaps were reported by world vision uk tearfund and oxfam while the data provides useful insights it is a blunt tool the median pay gap was used in this analysis rather than the average pay gap as it is a more representative figure and less influenced by a small number of extremely high earners although charities have a predominantly female workforce less than a third of the biggest charity chief executives are women according to recent research by the fawcett society a lot of charities have men at the top of the organisation with a large majority female workforce on the lowest salaries says andrew bazeley policy and insight manager at the fawcett society vicky browning chief executive of the association of chief executives of voluntary organisations says charities with a gender pay gap especially those with large gaps should see this moment as an opportunity to look at the culture and practice in their organisationgood parental leave and recruitment policies are necessary but will not bring about change if there isnt a culture in which those with caring responsibilities feel supported or if recruiters are not aware of unconscious bias john low chief executive of the charities aid foundation insists that cafs gender pay gap the third highest of all the charities analysed is not an accurate reflection of its culture it really upsets me i feel deflated he says i have worked really hard to be a flexible employer but this skews the figures as of all women but less than of men work parttime large numbers of highly paid technical roles in finance and it in caf are dominated by men whereas lowerpaid customer services staff and administrators are mostly women adds low although outsourcing it or offering less flexible working would make a huge difference to the pay gap he says i obviously dont want to do that we want to employ loyal committed people who know our business instead the charity is starting a pay audit both internally and independently verified to ensure that it is paying women and men equally and low concedes there is work to be done to increase the number of women on cafs executive committee browning says leaders must look beyond policies and consider what they can do to create a culture of equality bazeley believes that for a charity with a large number of parttime staff which uses that as an explanation for a high gender pay gap you have to ask why parttime staff are being paid less per hour than their fulltime colleagues similarly if the senior leadership team is mostly made up of men that poses questions about the working culture and how that charity views and values management and leadership a key part of the solution he argues is to ensure that senior jobs are always advertised as flexible roles the ncvo which has about staff wants all charities to declare their gender pay gap figures even if they are too small to be affected by the regulations susan cordingley ncvos resources director saysthe fact is that we act on what we measure if you dont measure it you dont have a genuine grasp on what the situation in your organisation is and you cant start to address it effectively not only is assessing the gap an important reality check for senior managers and trustees but publishing the data goes further and shows youre serious about transparency and accountability and at a time when

according to piers morgan and wide awoke does not relish opening with those words harvey weinstein believes he will eventually be forgiven by hollywood the disgraced film producer who has been accused of sexual assault and rape by more than women with criminal cases against him opened in new york london and los angeles appears to think that his time is not up and perhaps time is the great healer if you happen to be a powerful white man who can complete a day sex rehab programme early and still muster the energy to deny all accusations of nonconsensual sex less so when it comes to the women who have broken their silence but this isnt about them in an interview with gq morgan claims he spoke to weinstein in the clinic in arizona for about an hour weinstein denies that they discussed business or hollywood and released a statement saying my priority is my family according to morgan weinstein is fighting which one presumes is a euphemism for coming and going freely from a facility where his day reportedly begins with waking up early checking in with his east coast lawyers then visiting a juice shop where he orders coffee and a green detox mix with kale and cucumber it is the language deployed with such unthinking ease when men talk about men that is telling morgan refers to weinstein as a fascinating character an ageold way of excusing all sorts of bad behaviour under the guise of critical appreciation in the metoo age this covert form of defence is sadly making a comeback for morgan weinstein is less a man accused of multiple rapes and more the apocalyptic symptom of the whole thing the casting couch finally brought to judgment a description that denies weinsteins responsibility so apocalyptically he is reduced to both symptom and inanimate object in such arguments the system becomes the bad guy and the individual a mere product as though powerful men dont establish and run the systems which in turn enable them in the meantime as weinstein reportedly makes efforts to produce a documentary telling his side of the story and an interview between two men about some of the most serious and sustained sexual assault allegations of our time is trailed in a mens magazine the more pressing question gets buried why more than a month after weinstein was reported to be on the verge of arrest by the nypd has it still not happened,2018-05,according pier morgan wide

that during the first year of operation of the families who lost financial support for a third child were in work nine per cent of uk claimant households with three or more children were affected one hundred and ninety women were exempted from the policy which the government insisted was working and had been delivered compassionately after they were forced to prove to officials their third child was conceived as a result of rape the figures showed campaigners said the number of families affected by the policy would drive up uk poverty levels putting an estimated children into hardship the statistics showed households were exempted during the first year the majority because they had breached the twochild limit after having twins or triplets the policy means households claiming child tax credit or universal credit who have a third or subsequent child born after april are unable to claim a child element worth up to a year for these children the rollout of universal credit will increase the number of families affected all new claims for the benefit after february will have the child element restricted to two children in a family even if they were born before the policy was introduced margaret greenwood labours shadow work and pensions secretary said these figures are truly shocking the twochild limit is an attack on lowincome families is morally wrong and risks pushing children into poverty it cannot be right that the government is making children a target for austerity treating one child as if they matter less than another labour will make tackling child poverty the priority it should be alison garnham the chief executive of child poverty action group said an estimated one in six uk children will be living in a family affected by the twochild limit once the policy has had its full impact its a pernicious povertyproducing policy jamie grier the development director at the welfare advice charity turnus said we are still contacted by parents the majority of whom are in work fretting over whether this policy means they might consider terminating their pregnancy the policy was introduced by the former work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith who described it as a brilliant idea despite it being criticised as a chinesestyle clampdown on the poor duncan smith said it would force claimants to make the same life choices as families not on benefits and incentivise them to seek work or increase their hours in april christian muslim and jewish religious leaders condemned the policy arguing it would lead to a rise in child poverty and abortions the socalled rape clause has been vehemently condemned by campaigners who say it is outrageous a woman must account for the circumstances of her rape to qualify for support the snp mp alison thewliss called it one of the most inhumane and barbaric policies ever to emanate from whitehall a government spokesperson said the policy to provide support in child tax credit and universal credit

adopted children who have suffered traumatic early experiences are barely surviving in the current highpressure school environment and need greater support if they are to have an equal chance of success a charity has said they are falling behind in their studies because they are struggling to cope emotionally with the demands of the current education system which prizes exam results at the expense of wellbeing according to a report from adoption uk in a report it identifies what it said were gaps in understanding empathy and resources in some schools where teachers are increasingly judged on academic performance as a result adopted children are prevented from having an equal chance to succeed at school previous research carried out by the charity suggests adopted children were times more likely to be excluded from school than their classmates and they were more likely to leave education without any qualifications as part of its bridging the gap report the charity conducted a survey of adoptive parents and children to explore adopted pupils emotional wellbeing at school three quarters of the children who took part said they did not feel their teachers understood how to support them eight out of said they routinely felt confused and worried at school and almost of parents felt their childs academic progress was held back by problems with their emotional wellbeing the reports author becky white a former teacher said the reality is that in the current school environment many adopted children are barely surviving let alone thriving the root of the problem is an education system that prizes exam results at the expense of wellbeing many teachers have told us that they are less able to build proper relationships with their pupils and their most vulnerable students are dramatically falling behind it will take leadership from governments and schools to turn this around the charitys new equal chance campaign has called on the government to rethink the way schools educate the most vulnerable children and address a perceived shortfall in support needed in classrooms adoptive mother charlotte a teacher by profession whose son david was permanently excluded from his school said she thought all teaching staff needed a better understanding of adopted children and how to help them in the classroom the teachers put david in isolation when he did something wrong they didnt understand the huge sense of shame and rejection that adopted children feel whenever there was a chance for the school to be negative about david they would take it he was temporarily excluded on a number of occasions and was then permanently excluded that has been the ultimate rejection for him he was sorting his head out about his own rejection but now hes in a pupil referral unit his behaviour has gone drastically downhill and theres been a knockon for the whole family a spokesperson for the department for education said the government was determined to support adopted children and their families schools receive of pupil premium plus funding for each child adopted from care and from september schools will be required to appoint a designated teacher for children adopted from care to help them at school the dfe spokesperson said as well trainee teachers must show they understand how a range of factors can affect a pupils ability to learn such as

survivors of domestic abuse and their children are being forced to sleep rough as they struggle to find safe accommodation a report from the leading charity for domestic abuse has said womens aid said a survey of some of the most vulnerable women they have supported who were unable to access a refuge immediately found were forced to sleep rough before making contact including pregnant women and women with children others had even given up the search and stayed with their abuser the women surveyed were being supported through the no woman turned away project which works with women who were unable to secure a refuge place through calling the national domestic violence helpline and had a number of complex needs such as having children or mental health problems almost half were forced to sofasurf during their wait for a refuge space of which did so with their children and nearly one in ten gave up their search and stayed with the abuser government funding for refuges is under threat prompting warnings that the number of spaces available could reduce further and lead to more women sleeping rough the government plans to remove refuges and other forms of shortterm supported housing from the welfare system it would mean women escaping abusive partners would not be able to pay for their accommodation using housing benefit the last guaranteed source of income available to refuges the benefit makes up an average of refuge funding katie ghose the chief executive of womens aid said statutory agencies need to stop putting obstacles in the way of women fleeing domestic abuse and start supporting them to safety it is no wonder that women and their children who are literally fleeing for their lives end up sleeping rough or returning to an abusive partner if they are turned away from services who should be helping them she said the report showed that survivors needed the specialist support provided by domestic abuse services when they were at their most vulnerable were calling on the government to give survivors a castiron guarantee that their dangerous planned changes to how refuges will be funded are firmly off the table and that refuges will be protected we want to work with the government to develop a sustainable funding model for all domestic abuse support services so that every woman and child can receive the support they need to help build a life free from abuse of the women supported by the project nearly approached their local housing team for support more than half of them were prevented from making a homeless application which meant they were refused help with emergency accommodation nearly a quarter were told they were not a priority need despite having multiple vulnerabilities and were required to provide proof they had experienced domestic abuse the government is introducing a domestic abuse bill which has recently closed to consultation it is heavily focused on criminal justice measures and includes proposals to ban suspects from contacting their victims drinking alcohol or taking drugs there are also plans to electronically tag suspects as part of a new civil protection order womens aid and other groups have said the measures will be ineffective without a bedrock of support services to care for survivors of abuse in the uk the domestic violence helpline is in australia the national family violence counselling

the governments new package of fee relief for childrens services has clearly abandoned the basic principle of funding childrens services to meet the needs of children and parents per se the new funding criteria starting on july clearly establish that the governments interests are limited to the economic benefits of increasing paid work participation by mostly mothers their eligibility for hourly based fee relief will be based on activities related to employment or potential employment this ignores needs of children for time away and their experiences of educational activities except for hours per week in the year before school enrolment where the current funding package offers all children and their parents the benefit of hours two days care per week regardless of the activities of the parent now this will be terminated only if the parent can be officially categorised as disadvantaged or the child as having extra needs may hours a week be funded this means parents or children must be labelled stigmatised or otherwise identified as problematic to gain any access i was one of the feminists who fought very hard from the s on for funded childcare services for the increasing numbers of women who had paid jobs or wanted them it was tough then because women were expected to put mothering first and there was opposition because of the possible harm of collective care rather than home based mothering we argued children benefit from access to professional care and social experiences we won as quality care was clearly beneficial to all concerned william mcmahon had funded professional childcare workers salaries gough whitlam extended the program malcolm fraser separated childcare from preschools and bob hawke accepted the need for core funding a planned model that allocated services to areas of need with added fee subsidies for the mainly nonprofit services communities gained services however by then market models became fashionable so paul keating opened funding fee relief for users of commercial services which expanded massively so john howard removed the remaining direct funding to centres leaving supply fees and locations to the economic drivers of profits not community needs it was an attractive investment so most centres are now commercial now the final nail in the community service coffin is about to be applied the socially valuable access to childcare by all will no longer be available and children now in or needing two days care will no longer be eligible for subsidies unless they are labelled childcare will be no longer contribute to community wellbeing but be funded only as a contributor to gdp now the only criterion of valuing government spending where howard clearly supported womens right to not work he did not exclude children from care his successors have removed the validity of that option yes we fought for the right of women to paid work we did not want this to become almost mandatory most primary carers the majority of which are mothers now contribute their time to paid work but also are still mainly expected to be responsible for providing for childrens needs for unpaid care men who share these roles might still experience some prejudice at their workplace if they want that time out depending on personal circumstances diverse access to care is needed as a right not by a limited bureaucratised safety net many parents also use casual and short term contracts to allow for unpredictable needs the proposed reporting of activities and hours worked will make their access even if employed harder reporting to determine eligibility are not easy as uncertain casual hours and gig jobs increase there are also questions about the increasing market share of big commercial chains that are not addressed in the proposed changes the distribution of services in the market model is based on profits not local needs there are shortages in some areas and oversupply in others the model also shows the bleeding of substantial profits to big chains longleased childcare centres provide about to return on capitalcosts add to that the profits made by the lessee we can presume that more than profits plus capital gains on the property are made from subsidies offered by government plus parental contributions location and fees are assumed to be better determined by the glories of competition as parents were assumed to be ready to move children between services on the basis of costs and location and parents have no input or say so the communities of users no longer exist quality controls are inadequately funded and many local needs not met so is the proposed system now worth our bn plus spending the signs are we need a real redesign of the childrens services program when local services were communal and nonprofits they served communities with informal contacts and inputs yes they drew on local busy people for management committees but these built communities and connected the often isolated direct contracts with government meant fair distributions of services and control over fees and mixes of age groups current services are not meeting needs we have record numbers of children in contact with child protection or out of home care and maybe these needs forms of community care to be reestablished as part of what we all own given our increased levels of distrust of those in power could this be fuelled in part by the loss of the sense of partnership between parents and publicly provided services for the benefit of children does the absence of engagement with childrens services in any way reduce both the connected community of families and the perception that governments do care about children and their needs does the government assumptions that the primary parent should do paid work post parental leave further devalue voter level of trust the loss of community based care is just one example of the changes that have redefined us from citizens to customers of governments so many changes to social security and community services have reduced us to using contracted out and commercialised services one government controlled or delivered customerconsumer roles are explicitly distrust based as we are told we are responsible for getting the best deal could these changes be part drivers of the increasing devaluing of current political models of democracy as it seems to have lost its social equity function these are urgent questions we need to address as well as fix childrens services eva cox is a sociologist and social commentator,2018-06,government new package fee

design flaws in the way universal credit supports families with the cost of childcare are pushing lowincome parents hundreds of pounds into debt just for getting a new job according to save the children the charity said the requirement by childcare providers for costs to be paid in advance as much as a month for a fulltime place for a oneyearold on average in england leaves families out of pocket for weeks and risks tipping them over the financial precipice the problem has been made worse by common administrative errors which can leave claimants waiting up to two months for childcare costs to be reimbursed leaving household budgets in chaos and parents short of cash for basics such as food the charity said it added these high upfront costs will dissuade many lowincome parents from getting a new job and push others into debt this could seriously undermine the governments ambition for universal credit to help more parents into work and improve their paythe charity called for a comprehensive redesign of the childcare element of universal credit to mitigate its impact on poorer families before the rollout of the new benefit accelerates around families will qualify for childcare support by parents interviewed by save the children said paying upfront caused them stress and forced them to borrow from friends and family to make ends meet they said the reclaiming process was slow and unreliable and official support inadequate although universal credits childcare support is more generous than that available under tax credits it reimburses parents for up to of the childcare costs compared to under the latter system it is far more complicated to access and manage the charity said the charity cites the case of louise a mother of two who faced an upfront childcare bill for when she returned to work after maternity leave she described it as a stressful and unpleasant experience the payment in arrears system for poorer families contrasts with the taxfree childcare subsidy for higher income families this provides funding up front and the administration is far more flexible and swift an inequality between the two systems that urgently needs to be addressed the charity said although of childcare providers in england require parents to pay monthly fees in advance half of low income families have no savings and of those that do average household nest eggs amount to just steven mcintosh director of uk policy advocacy and campaigns at save the children said parents are trapped between going into debt to afford childcare and turning down work because they cant risk household direct debits bouncing this defeats the point of universal credit childcare support should help parents find work and improve childrens chances in life instead of making it harder to get into work the government must switch to providing upfront help with childcare costs frank field mp the chair of the commons work and pensions select committee said the childcare element process was brutal leaving parents in debt and unable to feed their children its another example of universal credit leaving children hungry because it fails miserably to reflect the reality of ordinary families lives a government spokesperson said under universal credit working parents can claim back up to of eligible childcare costs compared to of costs covered under the previous legacy system this is the highest level of support ever and if someone has accepted an offer of paid work they are eligible to be paid these costs for the month prior to starting work this generous provision has been widely welcomed by stakeholders and is available in addition to an entitlement of up to hours of free childcare universal credit has been dogged by implementation problems and widespread criticism most recently from the national audit office which last week concluded that the ambitious reform of the benefit system failed to deliver promised financial savings or

it is easy to forget when meeting older people in our lives parents grandparents and others that they are so much more than what we see in front of us as we age we become the accumulation of a lifes worth of wisdom and experience unfortunately the price of that wisdom is too often an increased vulnerability by other means elder abuse is in many ways the hidden face of the domestic violence discussion australia has been rightfully having for many years now whereas we often think about it in terms of intimate partner violence intergenerational violence and exploitation is something we are only now beginning to consider in similar terms friday is world elder abuse awareness day and perhaps there is a simple pertinent question to put forward are you aware that as best we can tell people face some form of elder abuse each year in australia i say as best we can tell because the data is hardly comprehensive in no small part because of almost certain underreporting an older person having problems with their family may be afraid to seek help or report it or not know where to go for help or perhaps even not think to seek help in the first place since leaving the human rights commission and joining justice connect i have encountered story after story of older australians dealing with abuse in its many forms ive heard of women like margot a yearold woman with schizophrenia she arranged for her son to return home to care for her only for him to become verbally abusive ridiculing and demeaning her in public she was unwilling to have her son removed from the home despite this as it meant potentially making her son and grandchildren homeless i heard of a woman ill call maya who came to australia to spend her twilight years with her daughter the daughter almost immediately took possession of mayas valuables and bank account details with which she bought herself a new car under the pretext of taking her mother out for a spin the daughter then unceremoniously left maya on a bench out the front of an aged care facility they havent spoken since these stories of abuse and exploitation go beyond more widely understood and catalogued tales of physical violence elder abuse is a complicated issue which sits at the nexus of ageing poverty and mental health and it requires serious sophisticated solutions that are sensitive to the needs of the older person healthcare workers are there to meet the physical and emotional needs of older people but that cannot be not the whole solution how are these dedicated nurses physiotherapists and social workers to deal with questions of power of attorney property or patients being pressured to change their wills much of what we consider to be elder abuse is legal and financial in nature making accessible and affordable legal help crucial this is precisely why new models of providing service are being undertaken such as health justice partnerships wherein lawyers partner and collaborate with the healthcare sector new thinking like this can raise awareness and skills among frontline aged care workers while having legal help available on site i have met with those helped by these services i have seen the difference they can make so i am reassured by the federal governments initial commitment of m in this years budget to scope a national plan to address this problem but the stories i have heard also raise the timely question of the behaviour of our financial institutions we see playing out on our televisions almost nightly a procession of people who feel victimised by unscrupulous lenders a not insignificant number of these are older people who are made vulnerable to elder abuse by bad actors among the banks we have seen several accounts such as the yearold perth nurse who is m in debt and at risk of losing her home where older people are left vulnerable having received loans beyond their capacity to pay at the banking royal commission we have heard that these loans are outright exploitative elderly persons are left in dire circumstances as a result of a loan for which theyve seen absolutely no benefit the banks will say and have said that they have met their legal obligations which raises the simple question will the banks set themselves a higher moral standard when lending or must the nation do it for them gillian triggs is the chair of justice

failure to support families at risk and reduce pressure on the care system will lead to child protection services becoming financially unsustainable the chair of an expert care review group has warned nigel richardson a former director of childrens services at leeds city council said that the struggle to cope with the rapid surge in children being taken into care at a time when budgets were shrinking could tip some councils into financial crisis launching the care crisis review on wednesday richardson called on ministers to make up a bn shortfall in childrens social services and create a multimillion pound fund to give councils the breathing space to find ways of reducing pressure on the system the review was welcomed by the childrens commissioner for england anne longfield who called on ministers to prioritise preventative childrens services in the forthcoming government spending review longfield said the huge pressures on the family courts schools and the care systems we are seeing show this is not a sustainable way of funding childrens services the cost to the state is ultimately greater than it should be and the cost to those vulnerable children missing out on support can last a lifetime there are fears in local government that child protection costs are in danger of spiralling out of control and are now potentially as much of a threat to council financial stability as elderly care costs last month somerset county council which has run up huge overspends on child protection was told it was at risk of going bust the care crisis review outlines how local authorities are under huge media and political pressure to intervene in families despite council budgets halving over the past seven years and despite concern that in some cases the risk is not serious enough to justify children being taken from their parents ray jones a professor and social work expert said the rise in intervention reflected a switch in recent years away from the idea that the state should provide support to families to help them through stressful times to one where the state intervened to protect them from failing parents social values have now changed we now blame people for their poverty in may the children and family court advisory and support service cafcass recorded care applications the second highest figure in its history just behind the record filed in june it costs about a year to look after a child in care the review group made up of senior judges social workers local authority officials and child welfare experts warned of a crisis in the system as well as unease over benefit cuts and rising poverty making it harder for families to cope the report found frustration despair and anger about the detrimental impact of poverty cuts and austerity on the lives and life chances of vulnerable families and highlighted the link between rising poverty and demand for child welfare services it also warned that a risk averse culture in social services coupled with cuts to family support programmes meant officials were opting to seek court orders to take atrisk children into care rather than working with families to resolve difficulties the report was endorsed by both the current president of the family courts division sir james munby and his successor sir andrew mcfarlane who takes over next month mcfarlane said the courts and child welfare system was in crisis fuelled by untenable workloads caused by rising care applications richardson who is credited with transforming leeds councils approach to vulnerable families said councils should be allocated cash to enable them to develop ways of supporting atrisk families before they reached the point where they entered the care system in leeds a m investment had safely reduced numbers of children going into care and saved the council m failure to invest in effective ways of diverting families from expensive child protection intervention would overload the system and end up costing more money richardson said it does not make one jot of economic sense for us as a nation to spend money so unnecessarily the care crisis review an independent study of the child welfare and family

increasing numbers of children will fall through the gaps into the care system risking school exclusion or falling prey to gang violence because of cuts to early years and youth services the childrens commissioner for england has warned anne longfield said cuts of to sure start and other preventative services since had effectively removed vital safety nets for atrisk youngsters and families and left them vulnerable to falling into extreme need she called for a reversal of trends in recent years which have resulted in shrinking resources focused on rapidly expanding and increasingly financially unsustainable highcost child protection and care services at the expense of prevention budgets longfield said children do not arrive in extreme need overnight and many could be prevented from getting to that point if we helped them sooner in a more effective way we are in effect attempting to manage and contain crisis in childrens lives after allowing it to escalate the economic and social costs are unsustainable the cost to the state will ultimately be greater but it is the lifetime cost to these children which we should be most troubled by they only have one childhood one chance to grow up already we see the costs of helping children later in life or of allowing greater numbers to become marginalised in the current pressures on family courts special schools and the care system in spiralling numbers of school exclusions and the consequent increase in younger and younger children linked to violent street gangs longfield who was introducing a study of public spending on children between and carried out by the institute of fiscal studies said england now spent nearly half its entire childrens budget on the children in the care system leaving the other half

women have to unite to tackle the obstacles they continue to face in the workplace a former sewing machinist at ford in the s has said on the th anniversary of the epochal dagenham strikes that changed the face of history it was a normal day like any other when female employees at fords dagenham plant who felt increasingly frustrated by an unequal pay structure walked out the strike regarded as a watershed moment in the fight for equality paved the way for the equal pay act of and has been retold on stage and on screen including in the movie made in dagenham but the role of females working at fords plant in halewood on merseyside who downed tools in solidarity with their southern colleagues has been largely overlooked frances kerwin is one of those forgotten heroines she had only been working at ford for two weeks when union conveners bernard passingham and rose boland paid halewood a visit to discuss the strikes hundreds of miles away our supervisors were saying you cant do this you have to stay because women didnt go on strike then she recalled but i wanted to join them because were all women my family were unionorientated my grandfather worked on the docks though there was a real fear that they might lose their jobs the women of the north voted to walk out of work because its crucial for women to work together kerwin now said before jovially comparing herself and her colleagues to the yanks that came in at the end of the war to help us win asked if women had come a long way since then she said not really but pointed to the significance of tennis players winning the fight for equal pay in workplaces people are still struggling she said women have to unite when we went on strike the unions were very strong at this moment theyre not they need to recruit women who can like us stand up and be counted but young people are now saying they did that years ago why cant we do it in the female machinists at ford were classified within the company pay structure as grade b that meant they were officially unskilled despite having to pass tests in order to gain their employment after years battling for recognition as skilled workers they finally walked out bringing car production to halt and becoming the focus of national news stories it was a meeting between eight strike leaders and barbara castle who was then employment secretary that ended the threeweek strike and resulted in the new regulation the women returned to work for of the male rate instead of the they were receiving before the strike since then they have given talks and appeared at film premieres earlier this year some of them even walked down the baftas red carpet with british actor gemma arterton in support of the metoo and timesup movements these conversations kerwin said are definitely important she added fifty years ago we were the minions women had to know their place she said she was was infuriated when the dagenham film came out and did not show the role of the women of the north the strikes success would not have been possible without us they would have been on their own she said but on thursday she is travelling down to london to meet the london women she campaigned with years ago some of whom she is still in touch with we made a little bit of history a lot of them have passed away fifty years its a long time girl isnt it kerwin and other former colleagues from halewood will be joined by steve rotheram the mayor of liverpool city region rotheram said he led a search to track down the halewood women so their efforts could be given the recognition they deserve and thanks to thousands of people who spread the word through social media and local newspaper coverage he found them without the stand taken by women working at fords plants in dagenham and halewood in the equal pay act would not have followed the fight has not yet been won but we owe them an awful lot he said those who walked out of the halewood plant have in recent years become a forgotten part of the story we will be taking a coachload of former ford workers and their families down to dagenham to celebrate their achievements on the th of june it should be a special day for all involved danielle flynn an apprentice from jaguar land rovers halewood plant thanked these amazing women from the halewood plant in its ford era for paving the way for women to forge a successful career in a traditionally maledominated industry the university of east london which is hosting a separate event with gwen davis and eileen pullen two of the original ford dagenham strikers on thursday emphasised the strike action was a key moment in the history of women and work not only did the actions of the ford sewing machinists initiate the equal pay act but also a period of increased gender equality said elaine yerby a senior lecturer at the royal docks school of business and law in this era of metoo and the recent gender pay reporting figures that revealed the existence of gender pay gaps in every sector knowing that the women didnt realise how brave they were being at the time provides the impetus for those committed to equality at work to continue

when the bbc first revealed that there was just one woman among its top highestpaid presenters the resulting scandal led to legal action a highprofile resignation and internal uproar topped off with an embarrassing appearance before parliament exactly a year on there are now no women at all in the top as so often with the bbc the writers of its own satire wa couldnt make it up as the shows pr executive tracey pritchard would say im sorry im not being funny or anything but the fact that its highestpaid stars are all white men doesnt look good its also easy to imagine pritchards reallife counterparts adding but lets make sure gary lineker is the highestpaid star and that this gets released when all anyone cares about is the football the match of the day host was the corporations highest paid star in the year to the end of march on some m its highest paid female presenter claudia winkleman took home about down k from last year but only because of some jiggerypokery with bbc studios the organisations commercial arm bbc executives most of whom have been unable to make a public appearance without talking about diversity and equal pay over the past year will try to ignore such glaring gulfs to argue that its gender pay gap the average difference between men and women has fallen from to in the year its now half the average for the country as a whole but that does little to hide a simple truth most companies the bbc included pay men more than they pay women the higher the pay the greater the gulf despite highprofile announcements of pay cuts john humphrys found last year to be earning four times more than the secondlongestserving fellow presenter of radio s today programme a woman is set to see his published salary almost halved the proportion of women among those earning more than actually fell slightly in the past year there are two major issues that no one least of all the bbc seems able to tackle the first is the result of historical and unconscious biases that mean that men are most often rewarded with the highest pay often along with the most senior and highprofile jobs the second is over the level of pay itself there are some who argue that people ask for and are paid what they are worth so linekers skills in presenting an england world cup match viewed by million people are more valuable than those of the strictly host with viewers averaging million each week yet the bbcs attempt to keep families watching on a saturday night could arguably prove more important to its longterm future than football matches most of which it has already lost to its commercial rivals and no amount of market valuation could justify the number of middleaged white men growing rich on radio no one is arguing that solutions are easy there are also even bigger issues highlighted by these figures that are possibly more difficult for the bbc itself by revealing the value placed on television stardom most ordinary viewers will surely wonder why publicly hired tv presenters earn quite so much more than nhs surgeons simply handing over a chunk of change to a handful of women wont necessarily change decades of entrenched behaviour witness the decision of carrie gracie who resigned as china editor last year and donated her subsequent equal pay settlement to the fawcett society which campaigns for womens rights and insisting on civil service pay scales would leave the bbc at the mercy of its commercial rivals yet such difficulties do not make the inequality and unfairness less of an issue the bbc fought the government to avoid disclosing its high salaries claiming it would create a poachers charter but its annual pay league table is providing a bigger public service than almost anything else it does including showing the world cup

a former tory childrens minister has blamed the governments woeful underfunding of local authorities for a crisis in child protection that is putting the safety of vulnerable young people at risk the mp tim loughton who served as childrens minister in david camerons coalition government said pressure on safeguarding services in some areas was so severe that often the only way to guarantee safety for children was to take them into care launching an allparty report into childrens social care loughton said a postcode lottery meant children and young people in serious need including those who selfharmed were physically abused or in families where there was domestic violence got varying levels of help or no help at all depending on where they lived children at risk often had to reach a point where they were in grave danger before social services stepped in to offer support the report found there was also evidence that decisions on whether and when to intervene to help a child were overly influenced by budgetary considerations it said in some places the pressure on childrens services is so acute it is leaving social workers feeling that the only tool available to them to keep a child safe is to remove them from their family said loughton who is the cochair of the allparty parliamentary group appg for children as a result families may look at these skilled and caring professionals with mistrust but this is wrong it is the woeful underfunding by government of a proper breadth of social care interventions that is to blame in many areas spending cuts had led to the erosion of earlysupport services for families and made it harder for them to access help the report said there was compelling evidence that thresholds for accessing services were rising to the point that social work was now effectively crisis management this meant safeguarding interventions were becoming more invasive rather than supportive leading to families being broken up unnecessarily the report said social workers often feel that removing a child from their family is the only tool available to them to keep children safe social workers told the inquiry that the shift to a more invasive approach was driven by a riskaverse approach born out of fear of media scandal by professionals lack of experience in supporting families and a lack of resources one social work team manager told the inquiry local support services such as family centres family support units and parenting classes are no longer available social workers feel unable to manage and work with risk without those services and therefore seek to remove children from home the report comes amid concern that growing pressure on childrens services fuelled by increasing numbers of youngsters being taken into care is overwhelming the family justice system and threatening the financial stability of councils already struggling with shrinking budgets the group said in local authorities in england overspent by m on children in care and by m on safeguarding funding for childrens services fell by in real terms between and while a bn budget shortfall was predicted to open up by it is unacceptable that childrens safety is potentially being undermined by a lack of sufficient resources the report concluded the inquiry called on ministers to tackle the funding shortfall for childrens social care and to consider introducing a legal duty on local authorities to provide early help services for children loughton was undersecretary of state for children and families between and he led a previous aapg inquiry on child protection in which concluded that nine out of local authorities were struggling to meet their legal duties anna feuchtwang the director of the national childrens bureau which provides administrative support for the appg said it makes no moral sense that families are left to face crisis and children are put at risk of serious harm because services are chronically underfunded roy perry the vicechairman of the local government associations children and young people board said this report is yet further evidence that childrens services are being pushed to the

what would cities look like if they were designed by infants as christine murray says what would cities look like if they were designed by mothers august they would have the slopes and lifts so necessary for pushchairs but what policymakers do not know and every infant could tell them is how vital it is for their development that their parents and other caregivers have plenty of good company because we are born so immature and fragile humans evolved in multiple caregiving groups no single person can do the job alone armed with this hereditary intelligence the baby town planner would ensure the presence of a childrens centre in every neighbourhood where people share the load as well as the pleasures of caring for small children and maybe get some advice or help as well when the millennium village in greenwich was being designed at the end of the last century i tried without success to get english partnerships to include a properly integrated sure start centre in it the concept was one of new labours greatest creations after all early years policy is still too determined by formal ideas of education as if you had to be taught how to find things out observe any preschool child and you will see how they cant stop exploring and as soon as they can talk asking why but they will not do this if their parents or caregivers are overwhelmed with stress and anxiety being a very small child is temporary and soon forgotten but it is by far the most impressionable time of our lives decades of developmental research has shown how acutely sensitive a babys brain and physiology is to its immediate emotional environment a vision of local childrens centres as a communal family is still far from recognised or understood dr sebastian kraemer london christine murray is spot on in saying that lived experience is a great teacher to all those responsible for our built environment that is why the professions including planning must have membership that truly represent the community it serves to ensure diverse needs are catered for there are more men than women planners today but it is fast changing across planning schools and entrants to the profession there is generally a split if we create places that are suitable not just for mothers but anyone caring for children and adults or those travelling with luggage it does not just make good business sense it is

i am at the current rate of progress i will be retired or worse before women in the uk are paid as much as men the gender pay gap starts the moment women enter the workplace and continues often getting wider with age until they move on to their smaller pension pots making it compulsory for large companies to report on their gender pay was a great step forward but futile unless employers act to close their gaps breaking the cycle of lower pay for women is complex but bosses could start straight away by simply putting a stop to the salary question in interviews and including wage details in job adverts the salary question that dreaded question about how much you are currently paid so that your prospective employer has a figure on which to base your new wage is a surefire way of ensuring that women who are already suffering a gender pay gap continue to be paid less than men as their career progresses the practice especially disadvantages anyone who has taken time out of work to care for children or other family members or who has temporarily done a parttime job to spend more time at home basing salaries on previous pay can also penalise anyone moving to a region with higher living costs setting pay in this way condemns women to lower earnings as galling as it is to see highearners such as the amazing carrie gracie paid less than their male colleagues it can be even harder for women at the lower end of the scale to challenge their bosses on the issue young women on zerohours contracts may fear that causing trouble will result in fewer hours and as a result smaller incomes the sectors that women commonly work in such as retail and care are less likely to have job security and often have high turnover rates meaning wouldbe complainants fear losing their job in job interviews when you are trying so hard to win a potential employer over challenging or not answering a question can feel even harder some us states and cities have already banned employers asking about salary history in the past year new york city and california have outlawed the practice yet young womens trust has found that in the uk nearly half of employers are still asking candidates about their current salary and admit to not including wage details when advertising roles the practice is most common in the private sector we are now asking uk employers to follow new york and californias lead and for the government to look at banning employers from asking the salary question altogether instead employers should be including salary details in job adverts this would make pay more transparent and would make it harder for employers to even unintentionally pay men and women different amounts for similar roles helping to reduce illegal gender pay gaps were also calling on people to highlight job adverts where salaries arent advertised using saywhatyoupay on social media being upfront about pay in job listings also means everyone knows where they stand we all know how hard it can be to negotiate salaries especially when impostor syndrome that feeling of not being good enough for a role comes into play having an idea of how much to ask for or a band to work within helps women should be paid according to their skills and the work they are doing not stuck on low pay because of entrenched gender inequality salary secrecy and questions about someones pay history

a silent crisis in the care system has left more than children with unacceptable levels of support from local authorities an analysis warns tens of thousands more are being looked after by english councils that are deemed to be in need of improvement with warnings that a bn shortfall in the budget for childrens services will emerge by anne longfield the childrens commissioner for england said the findings cast a stark spotlight on the inadequacies of systems that are meant to be in place to support our most vulnerable children the analysis by the social market foundation thinktank examined the treatment of lookedafter children who have been taken into care it found that over the past three years about of the children were with local authorities deemed by ofsted inspectors to have inadequate childrens services or services that require improvement the figure represents almost twothirds of all children in care there were in inadequate authorities local councils insisted that those deemed to need improvement in some way should not be seen as failing however only of local authorities were classed as good and only were rated as outstanding the study warns that children in care have educational outcomes that are way below average and are significantly overrepresented in the criminal justice system only achieved five ac gcses including maths and english in the national average is lookedafter children are five times more likely to be excluded from school while of children in secure training centres had been in care linda briheimcrookall from coram voice said the charity was deeply concerned by the findings and its own research suggested the state is not always the best parent experiences of children in care have improved from past decades and they now achieve better results than children living with families receiving social work support however longfield said standards needed to be raised every day our helpline gets calls from children in care who are being forced to move or denied help and when we investigate lack of funding and shortterm necessity are the most common explanations given she said sometimes children are told they have to move tens of miles away because it is cheaper in too many areas the system is creaking with inadequate funds and high staff turnover but its the most vulnerable children who are paying the price and through no fault of their own matthew oakley senior researcher at the social market foundation said the report showed that we are letting down tens of thousands of the most vulnerable children in society he said these figures should have already set alarm bells ringing in westminster but instead politicians of all parties squabble on twitter and play games over leadership anntoinette bramble the chair of the local government associations children and young people board said it was wrong to suggest that councils in need of improvement were failing and that the latest data suggested significant improvement unfortunately many councils are being pushed to the brink by unprecedented demand and increasing financial pressures with an average of more than children now taken into care or placed on a child protection plan every single day councils are now being forced to cut the very services which are designed to help children and families before problems begin or escalate yvette stanley ofsteds national director for social care said standards were not high enough in some areas but added since the start of about of local authorities have improved their overall judgment at their most recent inspection nadhim zahawi the minister for children and families said where a council fails in its duty to keep a vulnerable child safe we will not hesitate to intervene since we have intervened in

such is the financial crunch engulfing local councils those attempting to keep the show on the road are having to choose which crisis to deal with first adult social care had been the area causing most angst and while that issue is far from resolved there is now another area topping the critical list in the most comprehensive survey of councils earlier this year childrens services emerged as the top immediate pressure placing it above adult social care for the first time in at least three years those working with vulnerable children report the same vicious cycle services designed to prevent children from falling into trouble or being taken into care such as parenting support groups and classes youth schemes and sure start centres have been ditched by cashstrapped councils they do so because they have to prioritise carrying out their legal duties such as looking after and placing children in their care over time the loss of preventative measures means the number of urgent cases increase which in turn increases the workload of overstretched social workers desperately trying to keep up with demand from to the number of lookedafter children grew by if we dont get further funding we will see a further diminution of those services and an increase in the number of children being looked after by the state says stuart gallimore head of the association of directors of childrens services thats not somewhere that anyone wants to get into and it is a source of immense frustration that we do not seem to be able to be heard by government anecdotally some social workers say colleagues are threatening to walk out of the profession compared to a few years ago caseloads are higher so you have to prioritise your cases says gavin moorghen a social worker with the british association of social workers you are dealing with vulnerable people in the past you would have more breathing space to reflect on what that person needs its much harder to do that now later this year the public spending watchdog national audit office will publish an account of the state of childrens services it is not expected to make for easy reading the worry for gallimore however is that it will take something more tragic to focus the minds of ministers it really frightens me that what it will take is a death of a child he said sadly historically it has taken something as horrible as that to generate the kind of clarion call and funding that is needed the case for additional funding is now being made so loudly and clearly by so many it is hard to dismiss it,2018-08,financial

inquiries are like buses you wait for ages and two come along at once fostering has been ignored by officialdom for so long that when separate reviews were launched by mps andthe department for education it was inevitable that expectations would run high not so much among foster carers who have learned through bitter experience that not much ever changes but childrens services fostering agencies social workers and care leavers all saw this as a golden opportunity to press for changes they felt were urgently needed fast forward a few months the reviews have come and gone and the government has responded foster carers it seems were right to be wary nadhim zahawi the childrens minister broadly welcomed both reviews and made recommendations to embed best existing practice across the whole system it is difficult to disagree with any of it but those expecting major reform such as giving employment status to foster carers were left disappointed there is no extra money of course the charity fostering network described it as a huge disappointment and a wasted opportunity where does fostering go from here there is no doubt that it faces significant challenges some are rooted in the crisis facing social care generally after years of austerity others are specific to fostering including the recruitment and retention of carers for record numbers of children and young people removed from birth families but foster care also has great strengths safeguarding children at risk and transforming many lives as a foster carer i see the profound difference we make every day there are steps that can be taken to improve the lives of carers and support their work with vulnerable children these are my suggestions minimum weekly allowances must be mandatory the government sets minimum allowances reviewed every year but fostering providers are not required to pay them a significant number of foster carers receive less than the cost of supporting a child at home this is unacceptable our response to this practice should be as robust as it is against employers who fail to pay the national living wage allow foster carers to accept placements with other providers foster carers are selfemployed but with a big difference they can only work with one provider at a time they might be approved to foster on behalf of their local authority but can go many weeks without a placement but they cant offer their services to a fostering agency and seeking alternative temporary employment is impractical this feels like a restraint of trade that would not be tolerated in any other sector it is also inefficient use of a valuable resource foster carers should be exempt from council tax local authorities are seeking innovative ways to recruit more fostering families some offer discounts or exemptions for council tax this is a valuable benefit for foster carers and a meaningful contribution to those who maintain a larger home than they would otherwise need exemptions should be standard across all local authorities sort out staying put since may fostered young people in england have the right to stay with their foster families when they reach if both parties agree but the scheme is a bit of a mess the young person is no longer in foster care and the family are no longer foster carers foster care regulations do not apply a local authority pays about half of what the foster carer previously received the young person is expected to make up the difference either from wages or from housing benefit unsurprisingly the number of young people staying with their foster family has fallen to its lowest level since the scheme was introduced in according to ofsted offer special deals and discounts councils should use their clout to encourage local businesses to offer special deals and discounts to foster carers foster children have a right to enjoy the same experiences enjoyed by others their development has often been curtailed by a lack of opportunity but fostering allowances funded by council tax payers only go so far free or discounted tickets to farm parks the cinema bowling alleys and so on for foster children would make a huge difference to foster families without involving significant cost to businesses provide respite care it has become increasingly difficult for foster carers to get time off regular families can turn to family or close friends for help but this is unlikely to be an option for foster carers at certain times weddings funerals hospital visits graduation ceremonies young children need to stay behind just as they might if they lived with their birth families asking for help should not feel like an imposition as an extension of this it should be possible to continue allowances after a child moves on to recognise that a foster carers work continues for a time after each placement for example completing paperwork such as diary notes liaising with schools and other organisations that had contact with the child or preparing the home for the next placement emotionally the end of a longer placement can be tough and it takes time to bounce back having a small number of days still remunerated by the fostering provider feels fair in the spirit of the governments response none of these suggestions represents radical change nor will they solve all fosterings problems but they address daytoday challenges and go some way towards acknowledging that fostering families are also entitled to care and respect and they wont cost the earth martin barrow is a journalist and foster carer,2018-08,inquiry like bus

survivors of domestic abuse will be able to continue to pay for places in womens refuges through the welfare system after the government ditched plans to overhaul funding for the lifesaving accommodation the government announced plans last year to remove refuges and other forms of shortterm supported housing from the welfare system the changes would have meant women fleeing abusive partners would not have been able to pay for the accommodation using housing benefit the last guaranteed source of income available to refuges on average housing benefit makes up of refuge funding but after concerted pressure from womens rights campaigners and coverage of the proposals in the guardian the ministry of housing communities and local government said on thursday that all supported housing funding would be retained in the welfare system katie ghose the chief executive of womens aid said womens aid is delighted the government has listened and acted to keep refuge doors open for survivors of domestic abuse rent in refuges will continue to be funded through housing benefit this will be warmly welcomed by survivors and our member services housing benefit makes up on average around half of a refuges income an average of two women a week are killed by a partner or former partner in england and wales ghose said refuges provided a real lifeline for thousands of women and children experiencing abuse at home she said womens aid would now work with the government to develop a system of national oversight for lifesaving refuges the charity refuge said the proposals could have led to the collapse of provision of accommodation for women fleeing violent partners its chief executive sandra horley said housing benefit is an essential source of income for womens refuges previous proposals would have devolved this critical funding to local authorities which have no obligation to fund refuges this could have led to the collapse of refuge provision across the country a national travesty thankfully this disaster has been averted horley urged the government to increase financial support for refuges to meet an evergrowing demand under the governments revised plans housing benefit will be kept in place for all those living in supported accommodation believed to number around people in properties in britain around bn a year is spent on housing benefit payments for supported housing representing about of total expenditure on the benefit which is being rolled up in the new universal credit the housing minister kit malthouse said protection of the most vulnerable has always been our primary concern and following our consultation the case for keeping supported housing in the welfare system became clear ministers also announced they would work with providers local authorities membership bodies and resident representatives over the coming months to develop an oversight regime for the sector the government is introducing a domestic abuse bill which has recently closed to consultation it is heavily focused on criminal justice measures and includes proposed powers to ban suspects from contacting alleged victims or from drinking alcohol or taking drugs there are also plans to electronically tag suspects as part of a new civil protection order the shadow housing minister sarah jones said thousands spoke out against the illconceived proposals for supported housing funding which would have left some of our most vulnerable people without a safe place to stay but it begs the question why ministers put people through this pain and uncertainty in the first place three wasted years have strained our supported housing stock at a time when the need is higher than ever a result of austerity and the disastrous roll out of universal credit the government must now urgently guarantee housing benefit funding and increase the provision of supported housing only this sort of decisive action could begin to make up for the delays and damage that has been inflicted on providers and people living in supported housing,2018-08,survivor domestic abuse able continue pay place womens refuge welfare system government ditched plan overhaul

when jacinda ardern returns to parliament this week her partner clarke gayford will stay at home to look after little neve te aroha much has been said about ardern being the first elected world leader to take maternity leave and only the second after pakistans benazir bhutto years ago to have a child while in office many have criticised the fanfare with which arderns pregnancy and maternity leave was greeted by news publications they argued that women give birth and return to work every day and to make a big deal of this case undermines what should be an accepted norm but what isnt an accepted norm just yet is that fathers should be primary caregivers or at least equal in sharing the care and upbringing of their children parenting comes in many forms and at the very foundation is love so whether its the mother or the father or both looking after young children doesnt really matter right right but its still a fraction of dads that actually do stay at home in australia where fathers and partners are entitled to two weeks paid leave about of twoparent families take it up according to the australian institute of family studies in new zealand its thought about of fathers take the legallysanctioned two weeks unpaid leave for partners in the uk only of couples have taken up shared parental leave introduced in to allow two parents to share weeks of leave and weeks of pay the us is one of only eight countries in the world and the only developed country with no national policy guaranteeing paid leave for either parent of a newborn some states and companies have introduced policies for dads and partners but takeup is still relatively rare so why arent more fathers taking time out of employment to care for their children financial constraints are certainly an important factor and culture plays a significant role studies have shown that most fathers like the idea of paternity leave so whats stopping them places with successful paternity leave schemes make it mandatory for both partners to take a portion of the paid leave available when germany legislated that of a possible months parental leave two months must be taken by fathers the percentage of men taking paternity leave went from to more than in only two years after quebec introduced a similar scheme with daddyonly time more than of dads took up the offer research shows the benefits of strong paternity leave extend to the family unit as a whole when dads take extended paternity leave or take on a primary care role more egalitarian relationships result housework is more shared there are fewer divorces and couples report a more satisfying sex life children of couples in egalitarian relationships tend to be happier healthier do better at school have greater selfesteem and fewer behavioural problems girls tend to follow less genderstereotyped career paths boys tend to be in more egalitarian relationships and fight less for every month of leave a father takes the mothers future salary increases by in our new series seven fathers explain why they have decided to stay at home we wanted to explore the relationships that develop between father and child and the personal benefits men get from the time spent caring for their children this is not about patting men on the back but rather encouraging a culture change so that other men feel comfortable taking time off work to care for their children the fathers we speak to are unanimous in valuing the time they spend out of their paid employment to work at home with their children all of them urge other men to take the plunge they are keen to be involved in leading a culture change and to advocate for legislative change that would make it easier financially for men to have time at home with their babies they universally feel the standard practice of offering two weeks leave is completely inadequate but what is more fascinating is the way in which the men describe their relationship with their partners and children and how the experience has changed their lives for the better a few of the dads we speak to tell us that their mental health has greatly improved by playing such an active role in their childrens lives the benefits seem to play out far beyond their babies first months and years we loved talking to these fathers and being invited into their homes we hope you enjoy reading their

when will britains atrisk children finally be taken seriously when they become big angry adults who can vote the charity action for children analysed recent official spending figures finding that council budgets for early help services to prevent families reaching crisis point have shrunk by m in five years amounting to more than a quarter of lost funds sure start childrens centres have seen a m reduction in funding with many councils choosing to save money by closing them altogether it was also revealed that while funding for englands children in care actually rose these children took half the national care budget leaving whats left to fund all the other children needing help in the country resulting in many having to fend for themselves it comes to something for british children when being taken into care is some kind of dark bonus at least in terms of funding according to experts underfunding early years services doesnt even make good financial sense in the long run all too often it leads to costlier more complex interventions when situations do eventually reach crisis point then theres the wider human cost of the higher likelihood of damaged children struggling without monitoring or help falling out of education into druggy andor criminal circles and generally lacking the skills to build happy and productive lives after all disturbed angry marginalised kids have a nasty habit of turning into disturbed angry marginalised adults or is this too much of a longterm view for politicians and councils to contemplate it seems yet more grotesque when these days its become a standing joke how betteroff children get absurdly mollycoddled throughout their upbringings to the point where their parents practically end up following them to university in case something awful happens such as their stormzy poster falling off the wall their pot noodle being too hot to eat their essay getting an a instead of an astar or whatever else might be considered a major crisis in more comfortable circles of course im being facetious but many vulnerable young children arent even getting the basic help they desperately need to the point where echoing so much in modern britain theres an entrenched twotier child society that looks likely to get even worse perhaps it serves us to remember that enterprises such as sure start and other forms of early help werent conceived as optional social or recreational opportunities cute excuses to read some poorer kids bedtime stories pass around beakers of orange squash or play some feelgood patacake they were designed for big grim

fathers who spend more time caring for their babies alone are less likely to separate from their partners than those who are less handson according to new research that suggests the government needs to do more to encourage paternity leave the study which examined the link between domestic duties and partner relationships of more than mixedsex couples found a direct correlation between involved fatherhood and longterm relationship stability regardless of other variables such as ethnicity or wealth fathers who took sole charge of babies before they turned one were as much as less likely to subsequently break up with their partners the research found our results show that relationships are less likely to break down over the long term if the dad looks after the baby on his own without the mother being there at least a few times a week during the first year dr helen norman the reports lead author from the university of manchester said this correlation holds regardless of all other variables such as ethnicity genderrole attitudes and household income the research which built on previous work in said it was impossible to pinpoint cause and effect but norman noted that academics have previously argued that solo paternal care has a positive effect on fathers happiness and the development of fatherchild relationships which should make for happier fathermother relationships norman who has a sixmonthold child said that giving new mothers a break may be an important factor if i have a bit of time out i feel refreshed and happier when i come back it also allows the mother to engage in paid work outside of the home and she can compete on a more equal footing with her partner she said data shows that the number of men who take substantial time out for solo childcare remains small with more than of fathers still working fulltime the takeup of shared parental leave whereby mothers can transfer some of their allowance to their partners has been relatively low surveys and studies show that during the crunch early years of their childrens lives many men still felt financially professionally and culturally unable to take time off or downshift men said it was hard to persuade employers to take their request for leave seriously and expressed concerns about being sidelined if they asked for flexible working patterns leading mps called earlier this year for men to get weeks of ringfenced useitorloseit paternity leave to encourage fathers to spend more time with their infants jo swinson deputy leader of the liberal democrats who recently took her baby to a commons debate said the research made a lot of sense sharing care as she does with her mp husband duncan hames gave couples more in common she said adding that sole childcare was empowering for fathers for couples where care is shared not only does that couple have more in common which can enhance the relationship but it becomes a shared endeavour which helps reduce stress she said surveys

while labours commitment of vast new sums towards preschool interventions is welcome much more thought needs to be given to how they can be used most effectively to equalise childrens life chances free nurseries are a good place to start patching up our fragmented system september much of the inequality that now exists between the life chances of children from relatively wealthy families and others from poorer backgrounds is accounted for by what happens at home mainly in respect of the style of parenting and the home learning environment intensive home visiting programmes that seek to improve maternal mental health strengthen the bonds between parent and child and create a home environment that enables babies and infants to develop are being piloted but only on a relatively small scale such interventions hold the key to equalising childrens life chances during those crucial first years of life which all but determine whether or not they will grow up to become poor adults mega sums of money have been invested by successive governments in early education and childcare but the country has yet to demand the investment of equivalent sums in services that focus on parenting and the home that is despite the strong evidence found by professor michael marmot for example that early intervention through intensive home visiting programmes during and after pregnancy can be

thousands of children at risk of abuse and neglect are being left to fend for themselves because of substantial cuts to family support services over the past five years a charity has warned action for children said its analysis of official figures published on thursday showed council budgets for early help services designed to prevent families falling into crisis had shrunk by m more than a quarter over the past five years the cut includes a m reduction in sure start childrens centre budgets alone which fell by between and over the same period spending on child protection and children in care rose by m which local authorities have said is a reflection of rapidly growing demand for emergency interventions driven by rising poverty levels and welfare cuts imran hussain the director of policy and campaigns at action for children said we know from our own work that without the safety net of wellfunded early help services like childrens centres thousands of children at risk of abuse neglect or domestic violence are being left to fend for themselves until problems spiral out of control this failure to act with the right help at the right time will inevitably have devastating consequences for some children that last a lifetime as these figures clearly show it also makes no financial sense to cut early help as councils are then forced to spend vast amounts on expensive crisis interventions firefighting problems after they have escalated the government needs to allocate additional dedicated funding for childrens services at next years spending review without urgent action we risk failing thousands more children across the country the precarious finances of many councils have been blamed in part on the rising number of children being taken into care increased child protection spending is forcing some authorities to close sure start centres to balance their books an estimated centres may have closed since county councils warned last week that accelerating demand for child and adult social care which authorities have a legal duty to meet would trigger nearly bn of unpalatable cuts to other services from road repairs to bus subsidies the minister for children and families nadhim zahawi said the government had invested heavily in free childcare with million three and fouryearold children receiving free early education and hours a week of free childcare for deprived twoyearolds a recent report showed that formal childcare can have a real benefit on their early social and emotional skills we are spending more than any other government on early years education and childcare around bn a year by local councils can and should decide how to organise and provide the services for families in their areas because they are best placed to understand how to meet the local needs whether this is through childrens centre buildings or delivering services in different ways the shadow childrens minister emma lewellbuck said a labour government would invest an extra m on sure start as part of a major expansion of early years support childrens services are a vital lifeline to thousands of vulnerable children and their families across the country yet the tories have imposed cuts to local government funding that are making it impossible for councils to deliver them every pound the tories have taken means a service lost to the families who most need the support even worse the cuts have been targeted at the early help that is most effective at transforming lives earlier this year the childrens commissioner for england anne longfield said cuts to early support and youth services would result in an increase in vulnerable children falling through the gaps into care school exclusion or gang violence the number of care applications in england reached record levels in while the number of children taken into care reached its highest level since there are about children in the care system up from a decade ago england spends nearly half its entire

labour will extend the governments hours of free childcare programme to the parents of all two three and fouryearolds as the party moves a step closer to providing universal support for all families with young children jeremy corbyn will announce on wednesday that the expanded scheme would benefit more than a million children claiming the existing patchy support on offer is holding back too many families and not reaching the least welloff families on the lowest incomes would also be eligible for additional subsidised hours on top of the hours which would be free for them and cost no more than per hour for those on the highest incomes in his keynote speech to labour conference corbyn is expected to say opportunity matters most in the earliest years of life it is a crucial time to open up childrens life chances driving up standards of childcare will make that vital difference for millions of our children since january families where both parents are working more than hours a week but earning under each have qualified for the hour scheme which expanded the number of free hours for three and fouryearolds from a week however the department for educations own research shows that less than of families earning under are using their hour free entitlement compared with of families earning more than only of twoyearolds qualify if a twoyearold doesnt get a place in nursery then that twoyearold is likely to have a smaller vocabulary than other children less social awareness probably achieve less in primary school corbyn said on tuesday weve got to give all our children the very very best start in life giving children a chance in life means they achieve more and do you know what when children achieve more we achieve more corbyn will also pledge to increase average early years funding rates to help the many childcare providers that are struggling some have even closed as a result of the hour policy which they argue is not properly funded he will also set out plans to establish a national pay scale to raise standards of care by creating a graduateled workforce improving skill levels of staff the childcare system would be simplified for parents with the launch of a national childcare online access portal which would replace the existing complicated mix of vouchers and credits neil leitch chief executive of the preschool learning alliance said the direction of these proposals is certainly the right one additional support for parents a greater emphasis on supporting and valuing the early years workforce and a focus on raising and maintaining quality across the sector but as always the devil is in the detail and we would need to see a lot more detail on how these proposals have been individually costed to feel reassured that this plan is indeed sustainable or even possible in the long term sophie walker leader of the womens equality party said we have forced corbyn to face the childcare crisis that is leaving so many parents and particularly single mothers behind but if we are to stop women dropping out of the workplace and men dropping out of their families then childcare has to begin when parental leave ends that is also the only way to generate the savings needed to invest in the sector and the women who every day care for the next generation labour needs to stop treating childcare as social policy and understand that it is an

gareth jones once held his wife against a wall with her feet off the ground and screamed at her for years he abused bronwyn his wife of years and was twice convicted of offences linked to violent outbursts against her but gareth is still with bronwyn he describes his relationship with her as wonderful and she says she is looking forward to the future the optimism is a result of gareth spending two and a half years voluntarily attending a domestic violence prevention programme it was my salvation he says i walked in there thinking it would be some sort of backslapping exercise but it wasnt it completely turned my world upside down bronwyn says the programme gave gareth the tools he needs to cope with the issues behind his devastating behaviour the programme was about changing core beliefs of how they perceive women or perceive their role within a family she says or in life it literally rocks you to the core on tuesday probation inspectors expressed concern that the number of perpetrators being referred to the only course to be accredited by a public authority building better relationships was falling as was the completion rate violence prevention programmes are hugely controversial this was recently underlined by fierce reaction to a social media campaign by essex police and county council that many accused of encouraging survivors to stay with perpetrators campaigners and charities cautiously welcome schemes that are appropriately accredited but said they are concerned they could be used as quicker cheaper solutions at the expense of safe and effective

time domestic abusers cut reoffending rates by a third while an earlier groundbreaking study project mirabal led by professors from durham and london metropolitan universities found far fewer women reported being physically injured after their partner had attended a programme with before compared to after gareth who lives in north wales said he always had a temper but his behaviour spiralled shortly after the death of his monthold daughter i was a very arrogant person he says i always saw everyone elses problem as their problem not my problem but i was living a lie he first physically assaulted his wife who at eight stone was half his size about six years ago she had just come off a skype call with her parents in which he wrongly thought she had said something derogatory about him i just basically exploded it was awful he says i pushed her with such force she went over the double bed and over the other side he was charged and convicted of common assault but after moving out of the home for about six months returned to the family to find nothing had changed the arguments were getting worse and getting physical he says bronwyn a nurse recalls how gareths behaviour deteriorated after he lost their child ive been pushed to the floor and he has stood over me and spat at me when hes been drunk she says its been as bad as that about three years ago estranged from his wife gareth started attending choosechange the violence prevention programme run by the relationship counselling organisation relate cymru and accredited by the domestic violence charity respect based in a north wales community centre the meetings are similar to those of alcoholics anonymous men who have been abusive in variety of ways physical and emotional get together under supervision discuss their experiences and use a variety of interactive exercises to help them understand the impact of their behaviour the reason i changed was listening to other men in my position realising its not everyone else around you its you gareth says youre the reason everyone is suffering here bronwyn was astounded by the change in her husband he went on the programme and its like being with the man i met again she says the courses require attendees to remain for a minimum of six months and are voluntary gareth admits he signed up with a degree of cynicism and arrogance initially i was going through the motions he says i went with the well it will look good in court type of attitude but after two to three months the programme started to have a lifechanging impact and he continued to attend about months after he started the programme gareth moved back home with his wife he last attended a session four months ago and now talks about his marriage with enthusiasm and pride its wonderful wonderful he says we talk there are no barriers there one thing it has improved more than anything is communication in the relationship gareth now works as an advocate for choosechange at fundraisers sharing his experience with others and calls for violence prevention programmes to be offered as soon as a perpetrator is identified the programmes are not funded enough or publicised enough he says when i was in the jail cells they were my lowest moments at that point to have people whove been through it have an experpetrator come in and say this isnt the way talk to me if someone had done that to me i would have been all over it research has shown that the majority of recorded male perpetrators in one study had at least two incidents of recorded abuse to their name and on average two women a week are killed by a partner or expartner in england and wales provision of safe spaces for women million of whom experienced domestic abuse in the last year according to official estimates remains a priority for charities and campaigners with funding for refuges under threat as the government proposes to cut their only guaranteed source of income katie ghose of womens aid cautioned that programmes like the one gareth attended must never be seen as a substitute for real support for victims perpetrator programmes must be respectaccredited and must also be underpinned by a national network of specialist domestic abuse services for survivors she said if we fail to give the necessary support to survivors womens lives will continue to be at risk gareth and bronwyn agreed

first it was harpers in their october issue the magazine published an essay by john hockenberry the disgraced former public radio host who was accused of sexual harassment and racially inappropriate comments by women he worked with he sent them emails asking for dates made comments on their appearance and made sex jokes in august after multiple complaints about his behavior were made to wnyc management hockenberry quietly retired from his program the takeaway his behavior was only made public later in reporting by suki kim for the cut hockenberrys harpers piece titled exile reached nearly words extraordinarily long for a personal essay and details the suffering that hockenberry claims to have endured since his behavior was made public in the essay hockenberry relies heavily on the notion that his disability is exculpatory of his behavior hockenberry uses a wheelchair and compares himself to lolita the teen girl who is kidnapped and raped in the vladimir nabokov novel he claims that he has reached out to his accusers and has been ignored or rebuffed an assertion denied by the women who say that they have not heard from him later hockenberry likens the me too movement to the reign of terror during the french revolution and characterizes his harassment of colleagues as courtship do i dare make a spirited defense of something once called romance from the darkness of this exile at the nadir of my personal credibility he does dare then there was the new york review of books in an issue titled the fall of men centered on what editor ian buruma called me too offenders who had not been convicted in a court of law but by social media the magazine ran a similar piece entitled reflections from a hashtag by the canadian former broadcast star jian ghomeshi the piece like hockenberrys was a firstperson account from a man accused of sexual misconduct in ghomeshis case sexual assault that detailed the suffering he said he had endured as a result of his behavior being made public like hockenberry ghomeshi seems not to have much considered the impact that his actions had on the women he targeted and like hockenberry he downplayed the allegations against him and distorted the facts in a selfserving and myopic piece that is short of selfreflection and long on solicitations for pity ghomeshi who was ousted from his job at cbc in characterizes the accusations against him as stories that circulated online that he had been abusive to an ex girlfriend during sex in fact more than women accused ghomeshi of sexual abuse in incidents that ranged from sexual harassment in the office in one incident he allegedly told a female colleague he wanted to hate fuck her to wake her up to punching them in the face and choking at least one woman who resisted him what he characterized as online allegations was in fact an investigative expos from the toronto star several of the claims against ghomeshi were brought to canadian court where he was acquitted on all but one that charge was dropped on the condition that ghomeshi issue an apology no further reference is made to his victims but ghomeshi does recount two anecdotes in which he claims to have charmed women one who sang with him at a karaoke bar and another who he chatted up on a train he proudly tells his readers that he refrained from pursuing sex with her the reaction online to the pieces was swift with readers pointing out the factual errors and selfindulgent excesses of the pieces but even more concerning than the pieces themselves was the statements that these magazines seemed to make in publishing them in lending their credibility and prestige to essays that disregarded both factual realities and the lived experiences of victimized women both harpers and the new york review of books seemed to suggest that they as institutions were invested in maintaining a system that rendered women disposable and granted impunity to men and willing to disregard editorial standards to do so this sort of editorial gesture was expected of harpers which aroused controversy in january when they ran a piece by the writer katie roiphe that alleged that the me too movement was bad for women roiphe began her career with her book the morning after which argued that many of the incidents that were then beginning to be called date rapes were in fact instances of consensual sex that women simply regretted later on she has since periodically emerged to issue similar takes on womens rights that piece sparked controversy largely because of reports before publication that it would reveal my identity as the then anonymous creator of a crowdsourced document called shitty media men compiling allegations of sexual harassment assault and rape by men in magazines and publishing the revelation had the potential to endanger my safety i wound up preempting the piece by revealing my own identity in an essay for the cut the backlash over the roiphe article eventually led to the exit of editor james marcus who said in an interview with the new york times in april that he was fired for taking a principled stand against the publication of roiphes piece marcus claimed that the magazines president and publisher rick macarthur the grandson of billionaire john d macarthur had demanded a contrarian piece on the me too movement and then dismissed the editor for disliking the one that ran former managing editor hasan altaf gave a similar account of harpers publication of the hockenberry piece to the huffington post after recently leaving the magazine for the paris review the way it felt to me personally was that our opinions were not taken seriously or considered important altaf said of what he claimed was a nearuniversal staff opposition to the hockenberry piece the entire editorial staff shared a feeling and it was dismissed the incidents have damaged harpers credibility advertisers pulled their ads writers withdrew their pieces and subscriptions were cancelled mr marcuss departure means three of the last four harpers editors have been fired after editorial disagreements with mr macarthur rodger hodge in christopher cox in and mr marcus in in an email harpers editorial director ellen rosenbush who edited the hockenberry piece said that mr macarthur does weigh in from time to time on editorial matters but claimed that she held absolute editorial authority as the drama unfolded with former employees and harpers publicist giulia melucci trading jabs in the press an unflattering portrait of the magazine emerged the growing impression was that harpers had devolved from a once serious and independent publication to a disorganized and tumultuous organization whose editorial output was functionally little more than an organ for the opinions of its publisher the new york review of books was supposed to be different the revered magazine founded by coeditors robert silvers and barbara epstein in the review quickly became primary organ of midcentury american intellectualism making the uncommon choice to devote column inches to reviews of books from academic presses and publishing luminaries like hannah arendt irving howe mary mccarthy joan didion and susan sontag to name only a few alongside founding writer elizabeth hardwick it has long been considered a relic of the old school new york literati endowed not only with prestige but with a dignity that was largely lived up to by the writing it published after the death of charismatic longtime editor robert silvers in epstein had already passed in the continued existence of the review was in doubt but the appointment of ian buruma a dutch writer and critic who had focused much of his work on east asia to silvers editorship was meant to reassure readers and staff alike that the review would go on the nyrb had maintained its considerable prestige but the decision to run ghomeshis piece seems to have caused tumult and animosity within the organization that mirrors that which has allegedly roiled harpers employees of the review say that they like the editorial staff at harpers opposed the publication of the piece and that they like the staff of harpers were overruled by the powerful man leading the magazine it was review employees who leaked the existence of the ghomeshi piece before it was published stoking controversy online and leading to speculation about burumas intentions in publishing it some of us were afraid that is would pass without the furor it deserved one nyrb employee said in an email of the pieces publication being unable to speak out publicly ourselves it was extremely heartening to read criticism of the piece and of the decision to publish it online taken alone either of these incidents might be signals of mere institutional problems of the difficulty of asserting the importance of employee wishes to management or of the problems that arise in situations where one person particularly when that one person is white and male has organizational power that exceeds his sensitivity for macarthur the choice to publish hockenberry might be taken as a consequence of the impunity of the very wealthy in burumas it might be seen as the sort of misstep that can befall any new member of an old and venerated institution the dissatisfaction of these mens employees at least suggests that there are still people of insight integrity and moral awareness working at these magazines and that there is still good work to be done there but macarthur and buruma further degraded the credibility of their magazines shortly after publishing the hockenberry and ghomeshi pieces when they each conducted contentious interviews in which they doubled down on their decisions to publish the pieces and issued new bromides against the me too movement in an eightminute radio segment with the cbcs anna maria temonti macarthur criticizes his interviewers tone compares me too to soviet style reeducation programs and suggests that hockenberry could not be guilty of sexual misconduct because he was in a wheelchair when tremonti points out that hockenberry is accused of harassing and inappropriate comments things that you dont need to be standing to do macarthur rails against what he calls the womens inability to distinguish between harassment and assault the implication here is that while macarthur might concede that rape and assault are wrong he feels that discussing harassment is a bridge too far tremonti has to remind him that sexual harassment is a fireable offense you sound flippant tremonti tells him in complaining about harassment as well as rape and assault macarthur implies women have set the standard for their own treatment too high in a similarly revealing interview with isaac chotiner of slate buruma says that me too has had undesirable consequences among which he counts ghomeshis denunciation he condescendingly asserts that he published ghomeshis piece to help people think this sort of thing through buruma resigned days after the disastrous interview was published and though he asserted in a subsequent statement that he was not fired the dismissive arrogance of his answers had made his editorship of the review seem endangered when chotiner presses him about the allegations against ghomeshi he says the exact nature of his behavior how much consent was involved i have no idea nor is it really my concern it should be his concern as the leaders of prestigious magazines who hold influence disproportionate to their actual readerships macarthur and buruma have a responsibility to engage meaningfully and honestly with the public conversations that their publications shape and confront for everything else that me too has been an eruption in several highprofile industries a reckoning of longignored wrongdoing an overdue confrontation with the ways that men harm women it has also been an intellectual exercise women are introducing new information saying that they have been hurt and that they would like for others to be spared this hurt those who listen to them women and crucially men are being asked to imagine their anger their fear their frustration and their pain and to adjust their understanding of the world accordingly the project that me too has advanced is a visionary assertion that injustices can be righted that men and women can interact with more integrity and more compassion than we have so far macarthur and buruma have refused this project denying that the world might be otherwise than they have always known it asserting that their perceptions are the only correct ones those who are too defensive too incurious or too bigoted to engage honestly with me too are missing out on one of the greatest intellectual feats of our time moira donegan is a writer

introducing jian ghomeshi new york review of books contributor my loss no doubt but i had never heard of ghomeshi until last week when the literary magazine published his mournful confessional essay reflections from a hashtag but he might yet come to be widely known as an inspiration to opponents of metoo the piece dwelling on public disgrace related to recorded sexual misdemeanours appears a year after the allegations that gave rise to the metoo tide of disclosures and as a principal attraction in an issue whose cover line is the fall of men since the magazines newly departed editor ian buruma expressed disquiet about a general climate of denunciation brought about he suggests by metoo it seems fair to conclude that the magazine indeed intended under his leadership to portray the moment when women collectively spoke out about male harassment as yet another misfortune for his longsuffering sex as for ghomeshi the nyrbs contributors page identifies him as a broadcaster musician producer and bestselling author he was the host and cocreator of the cultural affairs programme q on cbc radio and tv from to so the only way an nyrb reader unfamiliar with this canadian would have known that the loss of that prestigious job was triggered by the toronto stars factchecked allegations of serious sexual misconduct was if the author had been honest or if the magazine under buruma had supplied the relevant context including complaints by more than women a court case a formal apology instead reflections from a hashtag which ignores or misrepresents complaints against ghomeshi becomes several dwelling piously on his lessons in loss and public disgrace is plainly intended to read as a kind of twitterage de profundis the real victim of his mistreatment of women is the reader learns ghomeshi himself another harmless butterfly broken on the pitiless wheel of metoo although as he playfully points out in an unusually accurate aside i was the guy everyone hated first the scale of the factual misrepresentation and of ghomeshis unfortunate tonal lapses where the circumstances demanded both rigour and sensitivity raised obvious questions of editorial judgment slates isaac chotiner asked buruma about the serious allegations including punching women in the head against ghomeshi the exact nature of his behaviour buruma said how much consent was involved i have no idea nor is it really my concern he wanted he said to help people think this sort of thing through if so why not further assist people by supplying the necessary information for a man who had done nothing wrong as ghomeshi implied except to be big headed and a wee bit inconsiderate the loss of his livelihood might well seem to justify to any reader who didnt google him his subwildean meanderings about public scorn but for a man whos admitted on the other hand to groping and obscenities at work ghomeshi is surely fortunate to find himself a threatened lawsuit abandoned with a redemption opportunity in the nyrb that his apologia should not unlike his victims accounts have been through rudimentary factchecking might suggest in fact that his reputation survives in better shape than theirs buruma having selected the whitewashing of ghomeshi as the hill he wanted to die on resigned from the nyrb saying hed been convicted on twitter but by which bit to judge by another wing of the echo chamber the perceived addition to their ranks of a bona fide intellectual claiming persecution by the mob has energised fellow believers in male victimhood from the familiar gonetoofaristhistheendofflirting alliance to people who can somehow connect burumas tineared obduracy with the deplatforming by pcs ever present censors of steve bannon local martyr toby young for example was quick to reattribute burumas departure to sexual mccarthyism by which he means presumably the politically orchestrated persecution of the entirely blameless on trumpedup charges back to de profundis i can sympathise with buruma young volunteers i felt obliged to stand down from various charities at the beginning of the year after a social media outrage mob called for my head to save yet another antimetoo activist the trouble of denouncing the sexual mccarthyism that robbed our universities of youngs mentoring its probably worth quoting since he doesnt one of the many tweets for which the educationalist unreservedly apologised last year the women here are smoking hot there should be an award for best baps even before ghomeshis lament the publication in us harpers magazine of a yet more absurdly selfserving account by a disgraced radio presenter john hockenberry had demonstrated the lasting incredulity in some cultivated circles that the exposure of serial molestation of women by powerful men could be anything but a tragedy for the molesters that offering in which hockenberry reflects with an indignation worthy of wronged dreyfus on an ordeal inflicted by the inchoate anger of metoo is entitled exile though hockenberry seems further to feel the injustice in wildean terms as an affront to his creative genius hed won an emmy award for goodness sake plus contrary to any impression created by the allegations that prompted his sacking he reveres romantic poetry in farfrominchoate victims accounts the typical hockenberry approach went want to get a hotel room or lets get you drunk from the start the very proliferation of such reports protesting any molestation short of rape simply confirmed to participants in the metoo backlash that its all hype hysteria the work of antiflirting manhaters according to this narrative burumas departure like the recent stories about brett kavanaugh can only be further evidence of a metoocreated climate of denunciation to borrow the

local authorities across the country are reeling at the cost of child protection as care numbers soar to record levels the institute for fiscal studies recently found that half the entire childrens services budget is spent on the children who are now looked after by the state so when new academic research shows up very large differences between england wales scotland and northern ireland in the proportion of children removed from their families its time for policymakers to take note a fournation study carried out by seven higher education institutions and led by paul bywaters huddersfield universitys professor of social work has just released findings that show that far fewer children proportionately are in foster or residential care in northern ireland than in england wales or scotland the research finds that if the latter three nations could reduce their care numbers to the same rate as northern ireland there would be fewer children in care in england fewer in wales and fewer in scotland on figures bywaters calculates that would mean fewer children in residential or foster care in england in scotland and in wales given that northern ireland has a higher percentage of children living in deprived neighbourhoods and poverty can exacerbate difficulties faced by struggling parents the expectation would be that the country would have the highest rate of children in care but the opposite is true it has children in foster or residential care for every children compared to per in scotland per in wales and per in england the cost to families and the public purse is immense england alone would save around bn says bywaters if it could reduce the rate of children taken into care to that of northern ireland this money he points out could then be spent by cashstrapped councils on family support and risk prevention leading to a virtuous circle where even fewer children need to be removed from their families these profound inequalities in childrens lives exist against the background of the decimation of support systems and services for families resulting from austerity measures and a deteriorating economic climate for less welloff families he says we want these findings to galvanise governments and everyone involved with child protection systems to think about the issues of equality and social justicewe cant all be getting it right if the rates of children in care are so different bywaters says the stark difference cannot be put down to poorer outcomes for children in northern ireland there is no obvious evidence to show that children there do any worse he says a more likely reason is that child protection services in the country are not delivered by local authorities but by integrated health and social care trusts which to some extent have been protected from the massive council cuts it cant not be significant says northern irelands chief social worker sean holland we havent lost any sure starts and weve prioritised family support and our last minister michelle oneil said she wanted to reduce the number of children in carethere are no targets but she said we will achieve it by investing in family support the cost savings of keeping children out of care are significant youre talking up to for a foster care or residential place with all the associated costs i can run a family support hub for holland says the northern ireland community family support programme has set up these hubs in areas each with a coordinator on hand to point families to existing support services northern ireland is lucky too holland observes in having a welldeveloped community and voluntary sector which has benefited from significant investment over many years unlike their decimated counterparts in austerityhit england and wales in scotland even accounting for the fact that unlike in england and wales many children in care are looked after at home or with family and friends in kinship care placements the numbers of children in care are still extraordinarily high says dr louise hill policy lead at strathclyde universitys centre for excellence for looked after children in scotland the spend on foster and residential care is a huge proportion of the childrens services budget while the budget spend we have on family support is incredibly low so then you ask the question have we done absolutely everything we could do with this family to prevent this outcome and i think in the whole of the uk we have become very riskaverse in terms of taking action on child protection issues sally holland the childrens commissioner for wales says theres no single answer for why waless rates are higher than england child poverty rates were until last year higher than england and there are certainly links with poverty but the patterns across wales show that this is not the whole explanation austerity has hit local authority budgets hard but preventative services havent yet seen the same level of cuts as in england in england leeds is having some success in bucking the trend the city council has instituted a right to a family group conference for children at risk of any statutory intervention including care proceedings during which the local authority works hard to put in place services to prevent the situation escalating as a result the city has cut the number of children in care from to since nadhim zahawi the children and families minister says we want every child to be in the stable loving home thats right for them which is why councils are only legally able to apply for a care order for a child if they are suffering or are likely to suffer significant harm the decision to issue a care order rests with the courts and is always made according to the individuals needs and with the best interest of the child at heart we understand how important support from childrens services is for families he adds citing the local government budget of bn up to which includes support for children and young people but leeds director of childrens services stephen walker says that the ability to support families before crisis hits depends on sufficient resources and support being available and local authorities warn of a bn shortfall in childrens services funding at a time when particularly services around early help and prevention are being cut the tools available to social workers to support families are reduced he says what weve seen in the uk in recent years is a shift in local authority away from spending on early intervention and towards children who are on the edge of being taken into care and those already being looked after by the local authority with less early intervention and support inevitably more children end up in care the evidence of northern ireland raises profound questions about how many kids should be in care says bywaters most of the money cut from childrens services has come out of early help and family support and then youre left with the very highcost options of child protection plans and taking kids into care theres a case for saying that weve got into a vicious cycle when its this amount of funding and this number of children governments should be thinking

francine west had been a foster carer for years when a council social worker knocked on her door and removed four children from her care i knew nothing about it and i was speechless just totally shocked she says i had to start packing their things straight away and ive still got some of it that they left behind that was unsettling enough but the siblings who all had complex needs and challenging behaviour were not kept together and were placed with two new foster families a separation that will have brought fresh upheaval to their turbulent young lives it was devastating because youve got kids youre looking after says west the baby was one and had been removed from his mum and he had a bond with me he was delayed in speaking i had taught him key words and phrases so he had that level of communication with me she believes that the decision to remove the children was a result of her revealing her intention to change foster agencies just weeks earlierwest had tolda private agency seven fostering services that she planned to move to a rival business she had been struggling to meet the childrens needs particularly when it came to transport and had been offered no help by the council after one of the children was excluded from school west was faced with the impossible task of getting three of the four children to lessons by am in different parts of london as her difficulties mounted her relationship with seven owned by afshan and aijaz ahmad came under greater strain and she decided to move to a different agency days after west revealed her intention to leave the london borough of haringey which had a statutory responsibility for the childrens wellbeing received an anonymous letter levelling serious accusations against west which she has denied its author claimed to have witnessed her being rough with the children and accused her of boasting openly of manipulating social workers to increase her fostering payments she should not be doing the fostering just for money the letter concluded within weeks the children had been taken away without noticefor the next months west struggled to find new employment while she sought to clear her name and seek legal redress in the year that wests career was suddenly interrupted the fostering network charity estimates there was a shortfall of foster households in the uk the network says it frequently hears of children being moved from their foster family too easily or unnecessarily and without the correct processes being followed and one source at a nonprofit foster care organisation told the guardian that wests case is far from the only time that carers and agencies have ended up in acrimonious battles haringey council denies that anything of that nature was the reason it removed the children from west a council spokeswoman says the childrens move was not a result of the dispute between the carer and her agency adding that it would be inappropriate to comment further a source familiar with the situation told the guardian that the council investigated the claims but did not find any reason to fear harm to the children westbelieves the anonymous letter must have played a part in a libel lawsuit launched against seven fostering she accused the companys owners of writing the letter in an effort to damage her reputation the company denied this claim a lawyer for the firm declined to comment further in court papers submitted as part of her suit west claims that the ahmads were so incensed by her decision to leave that they set out to damage her details contained in the anonymous letter to council could only have been known to seven according to the argument set out by her law firm carterruck which took the case on a nowin nofee basis in sevens defence its lawyers said there is nothing in the letter that wouldnt have been known to other people who knew west such as friends neighbours and haringey employees wests claim of the companys involvement they said was without evidence or foundation wests solicitor also claimed that the agency owners phoned the council twice in early may once it became clear that the letter had not had its desired effect in these conversations west was allegedly accused of irrational and inappropriate behaviour causing a breakdown of relations with the council social worker supervising her her solicitor argued that this sequence of events led to the removal of the children leaving her damaged in her personal and professional reputations and causing considerable hurt and upset the financial loss from her period out of foster care was more than according to the claim forcing her to take more than in loans incurring interest seven strenuously denied all of wests claims against the company insisting it was not behind any anonymous letter or phone calls had not failed to support her and that the ahmads had not sought to damage west in june an undisclosed settlement was reached seven did not accept any wrongdoing but paid west undisclosed damages and legal costs in march west resumed her work as a foster carer some fostering experts fear that legal disputes such as these are an unwanted side effect of private firms delivering a service that is meant to be about the wellbeing of children to illustrate the sums involved if a foster carer chose to transfer to a new private fostering agency with the children the firm might stand to lose up to a year per child martin barrow a campaigner and foster carer of years has long harboured concerns about the unintended consequences of forprofit foster care he says the profit motive skews decisions about where children are placed and how foster carers are treated and it is sometimes not in the interests of the child cashstrapped councils cannot afford to offer competitive wages to foster carers so many jump ship to private firms who offer larger fees and in many cases better support he points out but the legal obligation to find a home for children rests with the council and it often has to resort to using private foster agencies the upshot is that it pays higher fees for the carers as well as contributing to the profit margin of the independent foster agency many of which are owned by private equity firms a commercial dispute shouldnt have an impact on the care of children its obscene if children are being used as bargaining chips says barrow a spokeswoman for the fostering network says foster carers are key professionals in the lives of fostered children and young people and must be listened to and involved in all crucial decisionmaking about the children in their care,2018-09,francine west foster carer year council social worker knocked door removed four child care knew nothing wa speechless totally shocked say start

i grew up in care alongside other children with whom i shared foster homes and childrens homes in manchester in may i wrote a piece for the guardian about the time i spent looking for those kids later in life i only managed to find a handful but all of those i did see again years later had grappled with severe hardship since leaving the care system although discovering this was deeply upsetting i was not surprised the kids i grew up with were already dealing with problems that would have broken the strongest adults in care i witnessed them struggling with emotional and behavioural difficulties abuse teenage pregnancy bereavement and addiction is it really a surprise that some of them continued to face problems as adults child social care in greater manchester was stretched and underfunded when i was in the system today it is almost broken an investigation into social care by the manchester evening news revealed that councils are struggling to cope with the rising number of children referred into the system while the cost of accommodating them soars the men report found that children are in the system in manchester tameside and oldham alone in my home town of oldham where i spent most of my time in care the number of children recognised as at risk has doubled over the past year such news rarely makes national headlines but while attention is turned elsewhere tory austerity continues to wreak havoc on local communities the government hoped the private sector would compensate for cuts to local services but unprecedented levels of homelessness rising violent crime and the growing social care crisis have proved those hopes to be fantasy a key problem is that the tories seem capable of seeing only a couple of steps ahead it was shortterm thinking that caused the current housing crisis margaret thatchers righttobuy scheme seemed wonderful for a generation of council tenants who became homeowners and for tories who enjoyed electoral success in the aftermath but with more than a million families languishing on social housing waiting lists it has been an unmitigated disaster for the children and grandchildren of those homeowners such shorttermism also accounts for the crisis in child social care slashing services was great news for private care providers which were able to pull in enormous profits but it has been a disaster for children with the market unable to cope with rising demand and ofsted frequently finding privately run childrens homes to be below acceptable standards the tories dont see the need to spend money on vulnerable children theres no quick cash to be made but the longterm benefits to the taxpayer are enormous an estimated of homeless young people are care leavers while young people who have been in care are six times more likely to enter the criminal justice system than those who have not more than one in three lookedafter children are not in education employment or training after leaving care and only go on to university improving these shameful social outcomes will save the country billions but it demands serious longterm investment in local services there are many brilliant care workers in greater manchester and across the uk who have dedicated their lives to looking after societys most vulnerable children and yet the government does not value them social workers are burdened with unmanageable caseloads that are growing ever larger with no sign of help on the horizon more and more children in care will suffer as a result ive lost touch with almost all the kids i was in care with some of them are gone for ever others are in prison and more have completely dropped off the map with the situation for children in care getting worse such outcomes are likely to be exacerbated for future generations of vulnerable kids unless we get on top of this problem but with a government and the media preoccupied with brexit i fear this issue will not have the spotlight it deserves for some time to come daniel

fewer than one in seven partners at hedge funds and private equity firms are women and progress towards equality is slow according to a report based on financial conduct authority data out of partners at private equity firms hedge funds and other financial services companies only are women the percentage has increased by only in the past five years despite a plethora of initiatives to increase the participation of women in top finance roles including the governments women in finance charter a survey by the accountants rothstein kass revealed that hedge funds run by women were more successful than those run by men every year over a sixyear period despite this men hold of roles in hedge funds nicky morgan the chair of the treasury committee said greater gender diversity led to better financial performance reduced groupthink and more open discussions the women in finance charter has been effective at raising awareness on gender diversity but as this sluggish progress shows there is still a considerable way to go she said as the treasury committees report on women in finance concluded one of the next steps must be for firms to set out how they will support the progression of women firms should focus on changing the culture in financial services firms which remains a deterrent for women especially the bonus culture most firms in the sector are too small to be covered by the gender pay gap reporting rules that were introduced this year while the uk pay gap reporting rules do not cover partners said dean fuller a partner at the law firm fox amp partners which released the data on equality raised awareness of workplace discrimination means that firms need to consider what they can do to redress the balance he said these figures show that efforts to increase diversity have not gone far enough historically private equity firms and hedge funds have been maledominated and there has been little progress made on increasing diversity over the past five years this year the firm revealed that the gender pay gap was for people earning m or more annually in uk financial services companies and the gulf was increasing it found that the average gap between what men and women are paid in the financial services sector was and for bonuses while the average gap for the uk overall is there are men earning more than m in the sector against women according to the firm the gap has widened by over the past five years from in the financial year fox amp partners warned private equity firms and hedge funds that a lack of diversity in the workforce exposed them to legal risks a group of women recently filed a class action suit against goldman sachs in the us accusing the firm of discriminating against them in promotions pay and performance reviews fuller said smaller private equity firms recruited mainly through their own networks as many did not have significant hr departments and that reduced the potential pool of candidates while recruiting beyond

childcare fees for working parents have risen three times faster than wages in the past decade according to the trades union congress costs have gone up by per week since for families with a fulltime and a parttime working parent despite government initiatives the earnings of these parents have increased by lone parents were faring worse the tuc analysis found with childcare costs for a single mother or father working fulltime having risen seven times faster than earnings childcare in england costs an average of a week for a child under the age of two in nursery compared with in the cost is a week for a child over two compared with years ago the tuc general secretary frances ogrady said working parents have seen childcare fees rocket as their wages have stagnated despite government support families still face eyewatering nursery bills britains cost of living crisis is having a huge impact on working mums and dads the west midlands was the area where nursery fees for families with a fulltime and a parttime working parent had outstripped wages the most followed by the southeast and the northeast examples of bills included a year paid by a family on average earnings with one parent working fulltime and another parttime for a threeyearold and a oneyearold child a single parent on average earnings working fulltime was paying just over for the same coverage the tuc made a number of recommendations including subsidised childcare that would start as soon as maternity leave finishes as well as more government funding for local authorities to provide nurseries and childcare it also called for a greater role for employers in funding childcare and an increase to childcare support provided by tax credits and universal credit the governments flagship childcare policy currently offers free hours at nursery for three and fouryearolds although nurseries have long complained that the hourly rates paid by the government are too low last year a taxfree childcare initiative launched designed to replace the voucher system by giving eligible families up to free per child towards costs the tuc analysis was undertaken by the economic research consultancy landman

investment has been welcomed many parents remain frozen out of work because of high childcare costs we know that highquality childcare boosts childrens outcomes benefits the economy and allows parents

for decades local councils have been responsible for maintaining the safety net of last resort for those most susceptible to falling through the cracks vulnerable children at risk of neglect or abuse older people who cant afford care adults with disabilities the homeless all rely on local rather than central government for support when councils fail in their responsibilities the consequences can be horrific who can forget baby p the toddler who among other injuries suffered a broken back a fractured shinbone and a ripped ear before he died at the hands of his carers in or victoria climbi subject to months of torture then murder in so when a conservative former childrens minister tim loughton warns that it is only a matter of time before we see headlines that echo the tragic cases of the past we need to take heed as we report today councils in england collectively overspent their budgets for childrens social care by m last year spending on such care has risen by almost over the past decade despite the fact that central government funding for councils has been slashed by an eyewatering since these cuts are the consequence of the unnecessary austerity being pursued by theresa mays government since tory chancellors have maintained that the country cant afford to maintain its spending on services for the most vulnerable its a barefaced lie cuts to these services are effectively being used to pay for tax breaks for more affluent families and businesses who dont need them there is a double injustice the most deprived areas which have the highest level of need cannot rely on the council tax and business rate revenue of more affluent areas so it is here that spending on services has shrunk most spending on childrens services in the poorest areas has fallen six times as fast as in the most affluent this leaves councils in deprived areas facing budgets a fraction of what they were a decade ago but the number of children being referred to social services is up since then nearly a third of councils say funding childrens social care is their most pressing concern while the national audit office warned this year that up to councils could go bust in the next few years as a result it is true that some of the extra load on social services may be as a result of councils taking a more cautious approach the number of council care orders spiked by the year after the announcement of baby ps death where justified this is welcome there is no power the state has that is more intrusive than removing a child from their family yet it is sometimes unquestionably in a childs best interests and sometimes social workers can be overly optimistic about the capacity of parents who are neglecting or abusing their children to stop doing so with the result that children are left to suffer more damage at their hands than they should be but it would be preposterous to think this is the only explanation for the increase in cases being referred to social services social workers report that families actually now need to fall deeper into crisis before qualifying for help there is a link between deprivation and contact with childrens services and thanks to benefit cuts child poverty rates are forecast to reach record rates by moreover as cashstarved councils have desperately tried to protect their emergency provision for children in most serious crisis they have had to cut funding for the earlyintervention services that prevent families ending up at the door of social services in the first place by on average austerity has ravaged the network of childrens centres that the labour government set up to support families with young children a third have closed since moreover cuts have affected the domestic violence and mental health services so critical in supporting struggling parents to be able to provide a safe home for their children domestic violence and mental health issues are two of the most common reasons for referral to childrens services this inevitably leads to the wicked outcome whereby councils are forced to remove children from their families because the support that could have helped them remain with their parents simply isnt available this state of affairs marks an abrupt break from the approach of the last labour government which put tackling child poverty at the heart of its fiscal policy and ploughed billions into family support services and childrens centres one of michael goves first acts as education secretary was to strip the words children and families from the department for children schools and families it wasnt just cosmetic it signalled an ideological shift away from the holistic approach to child wellbeing that had been at the heart of labour thinking since and so in one of the richest countries of the world the majority of children in care the most vulnerable members of our society are looked after by childrens services rated as inadequate or requiring improvement as the cuts continue things will only get worse what a legacy for theresa may to leave,2018-09,decade local council responsible maintaining safety net last resort susceptible falling crack

ministers are facing demands for emergency funds to protect thousands of vulnerable children after figures revealed that child social care services plunged more than m into the red in a single year in the latest sign of the cash crisis engulfing councils across england senior local government figures now warn that childrens services are reaching a tipping point as the numbers needing help continue to grow and budgets continue to shrink the observer understands that the treasury was repeatedly approached for more funding by concerned ministers before the last budget but the requests were turned down theresa may has also been warned by mps that unless action is taken the funding crisis could cause another tragedy like the baby p scandal of figures show that last year alone councils in england had to spend m more on childrens social care than they had budgeted for it means that spending on childrens social care has increased at a faster rate than any other area that councils oversee according to the local government association lga which represents councils there is now real pressure on attempts by councils to keep children safe from harm the annual number of referrals to childrens social care has increased by children in a decade the number of child protection plans which assess their risk of harm and find ways to ensure their safety is up by the number of children in care is up in a decade the government has been handed an internal report into the causes of the increasing numbers but ministers have refused demands to publish its findings while some believe the increase is a sign of better reporting and more willingness by councils to intervene councillors and social workers say the axing of early intervention services such as family centres and parenting help has fuelled the problem children are now entering care at a rate of a day and the rise in child protection investigations has heaped huge financial pressures on childrens services councils have had to increase spending on childrens social care by almost in four years conservative mp tim loughton the former childrens minister said it is really worrying that the pressure on childrens social care has not received the attention that it really deserves for years local authorities have tried to protect spending on vulnerable children only too mindful of tragic cases like baby p but finances are so stretched that in many authorities it is hard to see how that will continue there is a very real worry that it is only a matter of time before vulnerable children hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons again and we have echoes of some of the really tragic cases of the past roy perry the conservative leader of hampshire county council and vicechair of the lgas children and young people board said these figures clearly show the huge and increasing financial pressures childrens services are under with many councils being pushed to the brink by unprecedented demand it is not just increased pressure for care for the elderly causing the problem for local authority budgets councils have done what they can to protect spending on childrens services and have spent over m more than they had budgeted on childrens social care councils do not want to cut the very services which are designed to help children and families before problems begin or escalate to the point where a child might need to come into care we are absolutely clear that unless new funding is found these vital services which keep children safe from harm and the worst abuses of society will reach a tipping point rachel dickinson vicepresident of the association of directors of childrens services said councils were being forced into counterproductive cuts by the funding crisis although government data shows spend on childrens social care has increased year on year this oversimplifies the situation we find ourselves in and does not take into account the increasingly counterintuitive decisions we are having to make in order to manage rising demand alongside reducing budgets we are having to cut the very services that tackle the root causes of the problems children and families face and prevent them from reaching crisis point the treasury must recognise this approach is unsustainable and is only storing up huge financial and human costs for the future unless a longterm solution is found to funding childrens services childrens outcomes continue to be placed at risk a government spokesperson said we want every child to have the best start in life with the opportunities and the stability to fulfil their potential which is why we have made bn available to councils up to for local services including those for children and young people we also provide a further m for councils to develop improvements in their service and create innovative programmes to improve the lives of these vulnerable children a source close to liz truss the treasury chief secretary who turned down requests for more funding said the chief secretary is keen to see reform in the system so any future funding is targeted at those who need it most this is an issue that the department for education the ministry of

just imagine mr speaker it is clear that the developmental issues affecting millions of uk children are so severe and of such enormous longterm cost to our country that only a concerted national programme of early intervention will suffice i propose to make that investment the centrepiece of this budget in the full knowledge that the benefits will be reaped by future governments not my own no we did not hear that from philip hammond in his budget statement this week nor are we likely to hear it from any chancellor of any political stripe any time soon in the uks political system the short term is all yet it is increasingly evident that focused longterm support for children and young people at risk of poor outcomes such as mental health problems limited academic attainment or involvement in crime must be key to tackling what former childrens commissioner for england sir al aynsleygreen describes in a new book as britains childhood crisis its an issue addressed in a report published today by the early intervention foundation eif a charity set up in to champion early intervention in childrens lives and a member of the governments what works network which disseminates research evidence to improve decisionmaking in public services after five years trying to make its case the foundations frustration is starting to show there is growing evidence showing the value of targeted support for childrens physical cognitive behavioural or social and emotional development as well as to tackle substance misuse risky sexual behaviour or the effects of maltreatment the eif has an online database of more than programmes rated by strength of evidence and cost one initiative called paths which boosts selfcontrol emotional awareness and interpersonal problemsolving skills is being used in some primary schools across south london after being found to have had a very positive effect on childrens wellbeing behaviour and attainment in schools in the us and switzerland for a cost of less than per child another called empowering parents empowering communities is now being used in blackpool following a highly positive evaluation of a pilot in southwark south london among families with children who have behavioural difficulties again the unit cost was less than the eif admits that a lot of initiatives labelled early intervention have not been properly tested or evaluated even effective schemes are unlikely to reduce childrens social care costs in the short term while calculating longterm costbenefit is very tricky how do you weigh spent on a paths course for a primary school class in against the potential saving realised by one child perhaps growing up not to go to prison in then there is the awkward truth that the governments troubled families programme has given early intervention something of a bad name launched in at an estimated cost of more than bn and aiming to turn around the lives of almost families the programme has so far failed to deliver conclusive proof of success and fallen prey to gaming by some councils allowed to mark their own homework this helps explain the reluctance of governments to get behind early intervention on a national basis some estimates put the fall in central government investment in early intervention as high as over the current decade but the main obstacle remains that such an approach requires a timeframe of years when politicians horizons extend no further than the next general election in a maximum five the eif reckons it detects a warming of interest among treasury officials aware that some existing oneoff spending on unproven earlyintervention schemes could be better directed it wants a longterm investment fund to back interventions in five testbed localities an acceleration fund to spread proven schemes an independent expert panel to advise on policy and research and a crossgovernment taskforce to coordinate work across the six whitehall departments with a stake in childrens wellbeing but well be waiting a while for a chancellor to throw weight and our money behind such a comprehensive strategy meanwhile as the eif report hints the better bet might be emerging local and regional planning by combined authorities like greater manchester if we are truly coming towards the end of austerity they seem more likely to be able to use replenished resources to take the long

parents have been warned they face rising childcare costs as new research reveals that nearly half of all nurseries preschools and childminders in england are receiving less government funding than five years ago department for education figures analysed by independent research firm ceeda and seen exclusively by the observer show local councils in england paid childcare providers up to less to provide governmentfunded places for three and fouryearolds in the academic year compared with the reduction has hit disadvantaged children hardest because childcare providers in deprived areas who are offered fewer privately funded children to look after and therefore rely more heavily on income from governmentfunded places are struggling to stay in business according to the report the average number of childcare places available to children under five has fallen by more than in the most deprived areas of england while the number available to children under five in the leastdeprived areas has increased by a third working parents of three and fouryearolds are eligible for a governmentfunded nursery place of hours a week during term time weeks a year if they earn up to each which means nurseries in affluent areas often have highearning clients who top up their funded places privately meanwhile nurseries and childminders in some of the most deprived areas of england the isles of scilly north lincolnshire sunderland bradford torbay middlesbrough stokeontrent and hounslow have all had their hourly governmentfunding rates slashed by or more neil leitch chief executive of the preschool learning alliance which represents nurseries said parents across the country faced a rise in childcare costs in the future as nurseries preschools and childminders were forced to increase fees and charges to plug the government funding gap in the worst cases providers who simply cannot make the books balance will be forced to close their doors for good this isnt an exaggeration its already happening leitch and the shadow early years minister tracy brabin have called on the government to increase funding for the early years sector in the budget on monday brabin said this research shows that despite tory ministers boasting of record investment in early years care the truth is that too many practitioners on the frontline have seen their funding slashed in real terms in recent years the consequence of these cuts is that experienced highquality childminders and nurseries are leaving the sector and that can have a massive impact on a childs life across all local authorities in england ceeda found an average realterms increase in three and fouryearold funding rates of just over the fiveyear period it has calculated that private and voluntarysector day nurseries and preschools face a funding deficit of m in its managing director dr jo verrill said this was having a disproportionate effect on lowincome families because they are least able to pay for extras when accessing funded hours and that in turn means that providers in deprived areas are struggling to generate the private fee income they need to stay afloat jo callaghan who has been running munchkins daycare nurseries in essex for the past years said over the past five years my overheads have gone up the wages i pay my staff have gone up and the funding i receive from government has gone down i have to charge parents for extras i didnt previously charge them for and its unfair on the children whose parents cannot afford to pay these places were sold to parents as free the government has been deceitful nadhim zahawi minister for children and families said this government has made very clear its commitment to highquality early years provision by we will be spending around bn on childcare support more than any other government and we plan to spend around bn this year on our free early education entitlements the total national average hourly funding rate to local authorities for three and fouryearolds increased from to nearly and all local authorities saw increases in their funding rates for twoyearolds this government has introduced support specially for lowincome families with access to highquality early years care through our hours of free childcare for all three and fouryearolds with hours available for working families in addition to the hours a week for the mostdeprived

new universal credit rules are making it harder for victims of domestic violence to leave abusive relationships and avoid economic abuse and control according to an influential group of mps the home affairs select committee has urged the government to scrap retrograde and backward single household payments under universal credit and make split payments for couples standard as part of a new government bill on domestic abuse in a report published on monday the committee also called on the government to increase funding for domestic violence refuges set up a new register of stalkers and investigate the introduction of domestic abuse leave the chair of the home affairs committee yvette cooper said the bill was an opportunity to tackle one of the most common crimes according to the crime survey for england and wales an estimated million adults experienced domestic abuse in the year to march millions of people are affected each year and two women a week die at the hands of a partner or ex said cooper the government is rightly proposing new legislation and a new strategy but our inquiry found much stronger action is needed across the board the committees report said an urgent solution had to be found for the women and children turned away from refuges each day including a review of current funding levels and legislation that forced local authorities to provide emergency refuge places shockingly many refuges are turning away of their referrals due to lack of space we urgently need more refuge places provision should be a requirement on local authorities backed by national ringfenced funding said cooper it praised the government for recognising the problem of economic abuse in relationships but argued the move to a single household payment was a dangerous step backwards separate family payments to ensure some independent income for the parent at home caring for children have been a feature of the welfare system ever since the introduction of the family allowance for very good reason said cooper if the government is serious about tackling economic abuse it needs to urgently rethink mps called for a new national register of serial stalkers and serial domestic violence perpetrators to be set up and for the government to look at establishing paid leave for victims of domestic abuse as recently introduced in new zealand as it could save lives the report also highlighted failings by police and the courts and inadequate action to prevent abuse of all kinds while responses were improving there were still instances of victims reports of abuse not being taken seriously according to the report these failings have a catastrophic impact on those who suffer abuse and must end the report also highlighted concerns about reports that police forces were providing the home office with details of victims who may have insecure immigration status adding immigration status must not bar victims from seeking justice or make them fear reporting cases of abuse to the police there remained a lack of coherence in the court system that could lead to some children being placed in danger and distress for victims looking to escape domestic abuse the report said one of the first tasks of any new domestic abuse commissioner should be to review the impact of family courts childrens services and the police on children it urged the government to include a provision prohibiting the crossexamination of a victim by a perpetrator in the new bill the new bill should encompass violence against women to ensure that it can both support all victims of domestic abuse and also reflect the gender inequality underlying domestic abuse said the report a government spokesman said the bill would strengthen powers to protect and support victims and survivors improving the management of serial domestic abuse perpetrators and stalkers was high on its agenda he added the national police chiefs council lead for domestic abuse deputy chief constable louisa rolfe said police response to domestic violence had improved substantially and that the rate of successful prosecutions particularly for coercive and controlling behaviour had increased crime is rising and so is the demand on our service but our commitment to safeguarding victims of domestic abuse and bringing perpetrators to justice is evident she said according to cps figures released in the annual violence against women and girls report the number of completed domestic abuse prosecutions fell by last year the volume of convictions dropped by but the conviction rate increased from to the highest ever recorded katie ghose the chief executive of womens aid said the domestic abuse bill is a golden opportunity to transform the lives of survivors and tackle the root causes of domestic abuse once and for all to achieve this the bill must reflect the reality of survivors experiences,2018-10,new universal credit rule making harder victim domestic violence leave abusive relationship

thousands of women council workers across glasgow plan to bring the city to a standstill this week in what is believed to be the biggest equal pay strike seen in the uk more than workers mostly women who have never been on a picket line will take part in the twoday action that starts next tuesday and will affect homecare schools and nurseries cleaning and catering services across the city while glasgow city council insists there is no justification for the planned disruption which it says will jeopardise the care of its most vulnerable residents unions say that a failure of negotiations has left the women with no choice but to strike and make visible the decadeslong pay discrimination that has affected this largely unseen workforce the dispute stems from when a new job evaluation scheme was introduced by the then labourrun council with the aim of addressing gender pay inequality instead say the women affected it entrenched discrimination by paying femaledominated jobs such as catering and cleaning less than maledominated jobs such as refuse collection despite them being deemed of equal value because of a complex system that penalised people working splitshifts and irregular hours the scheme also built in a threeyear payment protection for men who lost out on bonuses which was only last year ruled discriminatory by the court of session in edinburgh a year battle has been fought through the tribunals and courts many hoped it would be expedited when after decades of labour control the snp won the council elections in may on a manifesto that promised to settle the claims describing the negotiations that followed as a sham the lawyer stefan cross who represents of the claimants said the council had repeatedly refused to engage with any of the underlying legal issues or state its own position across nearly months and meetings before ditching a timetable suggested by the claimants and stating it would provide them with an offer in december its just not good enough an offer should be the product of negotiations not the start the women themselves demanded a ballot for strike action after that because their employer was refusing to negotiate he said the ballot results were overwhelming of unison members and of gmb members were in favour of action but critics accuse these unions who they believe have reinforced the industrial power of men at the expense of women for generations of manipulating an equal pay dispute to score points against the new snp administration the leader of the council susan aitken reaffirmed her personal commitment to equal pay and questioned the motivations of the unions leading the strike in an interview with glasgows evening times last thursday had the trade unions employed their industrial muscle on this issue long before now we wouldnt be where we are now they let the women down for a long time she said shona thomson a homecare worker for years and also her gmb branch secretary said it was patronising to suggest the women were being exploited by their unions its the cleaners carers and caterers who pushed for the strike she said weve been shouting about it since last year and the union listened to us weve got to the end of our tether with it in august scotlands local government spending watchdog described as unprecedented the financial burden facing the council if it paid out on the claims raising the prospect of scottish government intervention unions estimate that the final bill could be close to bn although the council has described this figure as plucked out of thin air gmb organiser rhea wolfson said the reason for council intransigence was obvious she said we were negotiating with the same officials who were advising their labour predecessors to continue litigation against us for years but aitken told the evening times there was a frustrating lack of clarity about the unions demands as well as shifting public rhetoric around the reason for the strike im not entirely sure the women know the basis on which they are striking im not convinced they actually know the demands made on us they are not pay up now they deserve to know that the union is not asking for it go faster there is an amount of work to be gone through and we will go though it as quickly as possible for thomson the spur for striking goes beyond the headline issue of equal pay lowpaid woman are always fearful about losing their jobs but we realised that were worth more than this she said its not just about equal pay but the changes weve seen the increased workload pressure split shifts the majority of these women are over and have been doing their jobs for years were not seen by the city but we keep the cogs turning working behind the scenes i love my job but ive come to realise that im a strong

set your children free urges the national trusts campaign to get children outdoors let them feel the wind in their hair smell food cooking on an open fire track wild animals and eat a juicy apple

kindergarten an innovative outdoor nursery established in will close its doors at toys hill this halfterm after the trust ruled that its daily class of young children were imperilling ancient trees and disturbing wildlife the nurserys annual renewal of its licence to operate in woods designated a site of special scientific interest sssi has been refused by trust managers despite appeals by parents and children to the trust and its president prince charles according to forest kindergarten founder caroline watts she and her children were given permission by the trust to roam beyond a small basecamp area watts paid upwards of for an annual national trust licence to run her nursery which provided governmentfunded free places for preschoolage children despite no formal facilities ofsted inspectors ruled the nursery was outstanding we have all been touched by the beauty of the ancient beech trees at toys hill the far reaching views which often made the children look stop and wonder the fallen trees which the children named the playground and the bat tower where they learned about the numerous types of bats said watts since our children have benefitted immeasurably from playing and learning in these special national trust woodlands we teach the children to respect the flora and fauna and their direct experience of it is exactly what will help them become adults who care about preserving it one parent liz simmons said her two sons attending the school undertook exactly the activities promoted by the trusts things to do before youre campaign in an appeal to the trusts directorgeneral hilary mcgrady she said i find it difficult to believe that a group of or so preschoolers has done much if any damage to the woodland which extends to over acres only a fraction of which is used by the kindergarten group one forest kindergarten veteran joe carter wrote his first ever letter in protest at the decision please let us stay you dont understand he told the trust in another appeal to the trust parents richard and sarah murison wrote how their son had developed a great love for all woodlands could identify tree and fungi species and was careful not to trample bluebells he and his peers at forest school are the future generation of environmentalists who have at a young age developed an appreciation of the world around them they said to hear that this fabulous learning opportunity is in jeopardy makes us really sad and quite disillusioned with what exactly the national trust stands for parents gerald carton and sarahjane oregan added we are amazed that in a sustainable regenerating woodland environment such as toys hill and one managed with such love and dedication by the national trust rangers that the childrens impact is such that their presence there is deemed undesirable a national trust spokesperson said we have tried very hard to accommodate the school at toys hill to help children experience nature and the outdoors however over time we have found that the sensitive habitat that makes toys hill so special does not provide the freedom of access and flexibility that is a fundamental part of a forest school the permissible area that natural england allowed the school to operate in is located in an area of active tree conservation the great storm of destroyed of the veteran trees at toys hill which we are trying to protect this means that special conditions are in place to protect the habitat soil and undergrowth in an area containing some of the best examples of oak species in kent according to data from natural england the governments conservation watchdog of the sssi site at toys hill is in favourable condition or is recovering the only areas in an unfavourable condition are because of rhododendron and other nonnative trees its latest assessment makes no mention of peoplerelated wildlife disturbance at toys hill but trust experts say that the presence of people in the wood has compacted the soil putting several surviving ancient beech and oak trees under stress the woods understorey remnants of gorse heather and bramble has diminished during the time that the forest school has used the site

them down outside a branch or a cash point survivors report banks demanding both parties be present when closing a bank account feeling shamed in branches when having to recount their story multiple times and being liable for debt they did not accrue the new code will focus on six key areas raising awareness and encouraging disclosure training of colleagues identification and appropriate response

terms of the cost of later remediation with regards to school readiness antisocial behaviour and mental health problems this is backed up by a wealth of compelling international research see the

approach to reducing inequality it was a service valued by all parents building confidence and skills through common experiences supporting connections between people across divides of class wealth

focus on identifying and targeting children deemed at risk as if the only risk was a lack of parenting skills this ideology the enemy of social solidarity is understandably resisted by parents and

no one can say the daily telegraph isnt doing its bit for equality a few years after running a story suggesting blondhaired women were paid more than their darkhaired colleagues the newspaper group is paying its blond men a fortune as well well one blond man anyway boris johnson is back earning a year as a telegraph columnist working by his own account for just hours a month on what some would call a column others might judge it a platform for blatant politicking in his own interests either way his market value appears unaffected by his two disastrous years as foreign secretary that salary wont help reduce a gender pay gap that is higher at the telegraph than at any other uk newspaper publisher or broadcaster women working at telegraph media group were paid less than men on average in march compared with on average at the bbc the bbcs genderpay disparities might be less jawdropping but they still provoked a storm of protest after the salaries of its highestpaid onair staff were published last year but heres where it gets tricky last week the beeb replaced its second highestpaid employee a man with a woman but despite being as blond as boris zoe ball will be paid significantly less than her predecessor chris evans and most of us cheered those developments because while it is definitely not fair for a woman to be paid less than a man weird economics and quirks of history meant that evanss salary was an unjustifiable amount for a bbc radio presenter to earn sometimes when writing about equal pay i want to respond the way i do when a child asks something difficult say its complicated and move on quickly yes its an outrage that men are paid more that women for doing the same job but it is also true that pay in the top echelons of the media has gone a bit wrong ball whose pay will rise above m when she becomes the first female host of the uks biggest radio show said im definitely not expecting the same as evans im very very happy with what the bbc is paying me if it comes out one day then im hoping people will say thats fair hmm when carrie gracie resigned as the bbcs china editor this year over its failure to honour its promises on pay the subsequent row focused on equality it is illegal for men and women not to be paid the same for the same job but a lack of transparency and decades of bias means that in nearly all workplaces men are paid more in the case of evans equal pay would mean ball earning m which may amount to equality but doesnt seem right this is the bind the bbc finds itself in nobody is arguing that ball who was a radio presenter in the s at the same time as evans is being underpaid not even her saddled with a number of older men who have been broadcasting for years the bbc has had to either twist their arm to take a pay cut john humphrys or allow the highest paid who are fed up with the scrutiny that comes with being paid a fortune to go elsewhere even here the economics are weird evans is set to be paid m by the rupert murdochowned virgin radio to broadcast to some listeners a week the radio audience is mstrong letting the market decide the mantra that guides most pay decisions in the uk has led to some of the biggest income disparities in the developed world and created a double injustice men and what they do are consistently valued more highly than women even when they do the same job and no cap has been set on those highvalue roles leading to huge gaps not just between men and women but also between the high and low paid the media industry is at the forefront of this debate because unlike say banking and football it is vulnerable to demands to reflect society and offer a public service putting a value on someones work is not easy how do we judge the worth of a doctor against that of a teacher or andrew marr versus jon snow theresa may and her former bbc press man believe marrs sunday morning viewers were more valuable to the prime minister than those of snow on channel these things are too complicated to be boiled down to monetary value at least johnsons value is easy to assess it lies in providing the telegraph with a frontpage story on brexit for its monday edition plans to put the column behind a paywall are likely to be stymied by johnson who once described the income from it as chickenfeed putting it on his facebook feed for free telegraph bosses may think this unfair but will not find sympathy among the many journalists who have lost their jobs in recent years for a nation that prides itself on a sense of fair play it is remarkable that unlike in the us there is no fair pay law in the uk meanwhile at the bbc many women who are not in the public eye remain mired in pay disputes and the telegraph pays top dollar to showcase one mans political ambition on its front pages life sometimes seems far from fair put victims first the police told luke and ryan hart not to read the press when their father shot their mother and sister dead in spalding in when they did they found sympathetic descriptions of their father as a nice guy or always caring there was a suggestion that being left by his wife had driven him to murder there was little mention of his victims lives journalists cannot be judge and jury in criminal cases but if the metoo campaign is to mean anything its that victims must be put first rather than revictimised suggesting that an affair led to a womans death rather than a mans murderous intent is as bad as saying a woman wearing a short skirt is asking to be raped a new feminist organisation level up has joined the journalist who interviewed the hart brothers rossalyn warren to launch a campaign calling on the press to change how they report on women murdered by a partner or expartner there are two such cases every week on average the goal is for domestic violence deaths to be treated with the same sensitivity as for example suicide cases which are subject to guidance by the samaritans and monitored by the press regulator ipso the industry should get behind this campaign,2018-10,one say daily telegraph isnt bit equality year running story suggesting blondhaired woman paid darkhaired colleague newspaper group

your correspondents raise very important points around the significance of homestart letters october i share their view that homestart has always been a brilliant and often overlooked programme back when sure start was beginning to receive significant investment under the labour government i lobbied for a chunk of these new monies to be put into homestart it works with parents in their own home which can only be good for children as well as the parents happiness and sense of wellbeing and value the proposition i made in my letter of september would take foundation years policy into new territory as well as hopefully getting a homestart service the intensive programme for which i advocate would involve parents receiving two home visits a week with a new book or educational toy being brought in for their child during each visit and being given greater confidence to read to and have fun with their child by building on the homestart model with a programme along these lines protecting parents mental health strengthening the bonds with their child and fostering a firstclass home learning environment the country would give itself a fighting chance of preventing children born into disadvantaged homes becoming poor adults frank field mp independent birkenhead join the debate email guardianletterstheguardiancom read more guardian letters click here to visit gucomletters do you have a photo youd like to share with guardian readers click here to upload it and well publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition,2018-10,correspondent raise important point around significance homestart letter october share view homestart ha always brilliant often overlooked programme back sure start wa beginning receive significant investment labour government lobbied chunk new monies put homestart work parent home good child well parent happiness sense wellbeing value proposition made letter september would take foundation year policy new territory well hopefully getting homestart service intensive programme advocate would involve parent receiving two home visit week new book educational toy brought child visit given greater confidence read fun child building homestart model programme along line protecting parent mental health strengthening bond child fostering firstclass home learning environment country would give fighting chance preventing child born disadvantaged home becoming poor adult frank field mp independent birkenhead join debate email guardianletterstheguardiancom read guardian letter click visit gucomletters photo youd like share guardian reader click upload well publish best submission letter spread print edition,"['correspondent', 'raise', 'important', 'point', 'around', 'significance', 'homestart', 'letter', 'october', 'share', 'view', 'homestart', 'ha', 'always', 'brilliant', 'often', 'overlooked', 'programme', 'back', 'sure', 'start', 'wa', 'beginning', 'receive', 'significant', 'investment', 'labour', 'government', 'lobbied', 'chunk', 'new', 'monies', 'put', 'homestart', 'work', 'parent', 'home', 'good', 'child', 'well', 'parent', 'happiness', 'sense', 'wellbeing', 'value', 'proposition', 'made', 'letter', 'september', 'would', 'take', 'foundation', 'year', 'policy', 'new', 'territory', 'well', 'hopefully', 'getting', 'homestart', 'service', 'intensive', 'programme', 'advocate', 'would', 'involve', 'parent', 'receiving', 'two', 'home', 'visit', 'week', 'new', 'book', 'educational', 'toy', 'brought', 'child', 'visit', 'given', 'greater', 'confidence', 'read', 'fun', 'child', 'building', 'homestart', 'model', 'programme', 'along', 'line', 'protecting', 'parent', 'mental', 'health', 'strengthening', 'bond', 'child', 'fostering', 'firstclass', 'home', 'learning', 'environment', 'country', 'would', 'give', 'fighting', 'chance', 'preventing', 'child', 'born', 'disadvantaged', 'home', 'becoming', 'poor', 'adult', 'frank', 'field', 'mp', 'independent', 'birkenhead', 'join', 'debate', 'email', 'guardianletterstheguardiancom', 'read', 'guardian', 'letter', 'click', 'visit', 'gucomletters', 'photo', 'youd', 'like', 'share', 'guardian', 'reader', 'click', 'upload', 'well', 'publish', 'best', 'submission', 'letter', 'spread', 'print', 'edition']",50
i am surprised to read the letter from frank field referring to intensive homevisiting programmes being piloted but only on a relatively small scale letters september what about homestart that is not a smallscale pilot last week i attended the th anniversary agm of homestart nottingham this was the second scheme to be established after the original in leicester set up in by margaret harrison who had used a scholarship to look into the headstart education programme in the us she adapted the idea of volunteers doing home visiting to offer support guidance and friendship to parents with young children who were not coping for various reasons homestart grew over the decades to cover many parts of the country and to military families abroad it is now suffering from drastic cuts in funding owing to savage budgetary constraints on statutory agencies homestart contributes to the prevention of problems in families providing savings to health and social services and in education as a relatively economical method of early intervention using trained volunteers it provides a safety net for babies young children and their parents and must be supported janet lail nottingham frank field writes mega sums of money have been invested by successive governments in early education and childcare but the country has yet to demand the investment of equivalent sums in services that focus on parenting and the home on the same day is news of m cuts more than a quarter of the total to local early years provision in the past five years children at risk forced to fend for themselves after budget cuts september this ought to be a national scandal but is not it barely registers why is it so difficult to think seriously about the earliest and most critical phase of human development our only access to what infants experience is from the enthralling and sometimes disturbing impact they have on us for many including those who make policy it is simply unbearable to contemplate their helplessness so we switch off it is like trying to persuade the majority that climate change is doing us harm even those who agree forget their assent within minutes because these things cannot be fully imagined neither global warming nor the essentials of infant development can be thought about for long enough to concentrate the public mind dr sebastian kraemer association for infant mental health uk frank field praises intensive home visiting as the kind of intervention that holds the key to equalising childrens life chances during the crucial first years of life the local homestart charities have for the past years trained and supervised parent volunteers to spend time every week with distressed families at home and we have accumulated substantial evidence that it really works and is the kind of deep warm persistent help that parents value in there were parent volunteers with families visited with young children but it is still not nearly enough to meet demand here at homestart reading like most homestarts we no longer have underpinning from local authority longterm funding but must depend on the kindness of local donors and the overstretched big lottery and private trusts if labour or any other administration wants to tackle the terrible inequality of life chances for young children they could do worse than look local to fund the expertise and commitment already existing in the voluntary sector jill lake trustee homestart reading frank field is right about the beneficial impact that homevisiting support can have on parents and on improving life chances for their children yet this comes in the week that more evidence has emerged of the devastating level of cuts that have been made to early years childrens services in the past five years over the last years homestart has demonstrated the power of support for parents in the home currently homestarts work in over communities right across the uk but if this approach were to be replicated in every community as mr field suggests it would be a transformative programme for government vivien waterfield deputy ceo homestart uk frank field mp is spoton about early intervention being essential to equalise childrens life chances homestart has been right there at the kitchen sink for many years struggling to survive amid budget cuts but it provides a blueprint for what can be done mothers who volunteer to help other mothers and their very young children started the revolution and would happily take up the challenge of intensive home visiting programmes if longterm backing was assured its

millions of women in lowpaid parttime work will be among the main losers from tax and benefit changes that will come into effect in april despite repeated government promises to help them a new study of the chancellors recent budget has shown analysis of the latest changes carried out by the institute for public policy research ippr has also found that income for the top of households will increase by bn more than for the bottom widening the overall earnings gap between the richest and poorest philip hammond used his third budget to bring forward by a year a conservative manifesto pledge to increase the taxfree personal allowance to and raise the higherrate tax threshold to last week the women and equalities minister penny mordaunt said the government was committed to helping lowpaid women we need to broaden out our work beyond the ftse beyond london beyond women executives and big business she said we need to focus on small business parttime work women from all parts of the uk lowpaid women women with multiple barriers to meeting their full potential but the ippr study released to the observer shows that the vast majority of those who will fare worst from the budget changes missing out on tax cuts because they earn too little to profit from the rise in allowance and suffering reductions in real incomes as a result of the benefits freeze will be women many of these are parttime workers a section of the workforce where median pay is a year and so below the new personal tax threshold of the ippr also concludes in its analysis that the policy of raising the taxfree threshold has disproportionately benefited those on middle and higher incomes the latest rise in the threshold will bypass of lowpaid workers million people while giving a tax cut to millions earning up to a year while lowpaid workers benefited from the rise in the personal allowance from to in just will benefit from the latest rise next year while million workers earning up to will also receive the tax cut clare mcneil associate director of the ippr said while those on middle and higher incomes are receiving a tax cut and some public sector workers are finally receiving longoverdue pay increases the lowest paid are not only missing out on this easing of austerity but are actively being made poorer each year by the benefits freeze the majority of these will be women doing parttime work our analysis shows that the policy of increasing the personal tax allowance to help the lowest paid ran out of steam some years ago to actually support the lowest paid the bn in foregone tax revenue from this policy could instead have prevented the need for draconian cuts to the benefits system or such severe cuts to public services in the short term the government should reverse the benefits freeze which can no longer be defended over the longer term personal income taxes should be reformed to improve work incentives for low earners as ipprs commission on economic justice has proposed currently a total of million women are lowpaid meaning they earn less than a year this group makes up more than a third of the female workforce the ipprs findings will embolden mps from all parties who have questioned the governments claims to be ending austerity and helping those in work but struggling to make ends meet jess phillips chair of the womens group of labour mps said the government is not only failing to help the many women in work but is actually pushing those on low pay deeper into poverty there should be proper impact assessments carried out which prevent them introducing policies which have such a devastating effect on so many often single working women and their children a group of senior tory mps including five former conservative cabinet ministers david davis justine greening nicky morgan david willetts and iain duncan smith are among those arguing that the benefit freeze is causing undue hardship morgan now chair of the allparty treasury select committee said there are now increases in public sector pay and there should be a link between benefits and wages we always have to be wary as a party of being seen to know the cost of everything and the value of nothing from the start of her premiership theresa may has stressed her personal commitment to formulating tax and wider economic policies so they help low earners and to reducing earnings

the guardians investigation on childrens homes vulnerable children auctioned online in carehome system experts warn november is hugely disturbing and grimly highlights why we must do better for our children it is unacceptable for children to be treated in a way that deprives them of their dignity or fails to make their best interests paramount we believe care homes can be the first choice not the last resort for some children especially teenagers who have struggled with family placements in the past thats why we are urging local authorities to work with us to develop a new model for care homes one which puts childrens needs first is focused on delivering the best outcomes for children and gives value for money to the taxpayer carol iddon managing director of childrens services action for children many young people leaving residential care carry the burden of earlier systemic failures in helping their families when problems first arise so young people can remain at home or with kinship carers or in finding them an adoptive or foster family instead for many their lives have been further disrupted and they have ended up in residential care to break this cycle and move away from childrens homes being used as a last resort will require radically rethinking their role one approach would be to develop an integrated model where childrens homes make an important contribution in addressing the systemic failures identified above first to assist family and kinship support through providing care when young people need time out of their families second to support adoptive and foster care placements when carers and young people may need a break from each other third to provide care for young people who would benefit from living in a childrens home including young people who choose to live in group care who for different reasons have been unable to settle in family placements and those who will be assisted by different therapeutic approaches this will require wellfunded local services and is the antithesis of the unethical marketisation of care which results in the dispersal and attendant estrangement of highly vulnerable teenagers from their families and communities prof mike stein university of york government reports on adoption fostering childrens homes and residential special schools have not provided a cohesive strategy for childrens services currently the residential care leadership board only has the chair appointed childrens homes are taking the lead with the necessary new thinking partnership ethics and relationships it is time to move beyond

the number of children in care after being removed from their parents because they were at risk of abuse or neglect rose again last year amid concerns over the impact of austerity cuts and poverty on vulnerable families the latest official figures reveal there were lookedafter children in england at the end of march up on the previous year the number has increased steadily every year since when the total was about they also reveal another fall in children being adopted suggesting the major adoption push by the former prime minister david cameron under the coalition government has fizzled out adoption numbers fell year on year to well down from the peak of emma lewellbuck the shadow minister for children and families said the rises reflected savage government cuts to early help and support services such as sure start which could help keep children with their families avoiding the need for care she said the government is missing valuable opportunities to keep children in the care of their families not only does that add pressure to budgets already decimated by austerity it also leaves children and their families with deep and enduring emotional scars local authorities are increasingly worried that the escalating costs of looking after children at risk as council budgets are rapidly shrinking are tipping some councils towards insolvency councils spend more than half of their childrens services budgets on children in the care system senior family court judges warned in june that the family justice system was in crisis as a result of untenable increases in the number of applications from councils to take children into care earlier this week the guardian revealed a crisis in the childrens residential care sector which looks after about one in of children in care an investigation found vulnerable children were being treated like cattle and moved around care homes across england and wales the most common reason for children being taken into care was abuse or neglect accounting for of the total the latest statistics show other categories were family dysfunction families in acute stress absent parenting and other reasons most lookedafter children were fostered with an increasing number placed with relatives or friends under guardianship arrangements about were placed in secure units and childrens homes four out of children were placed outside their local authority with one in five moving more than miles away the minister for children and families nadhim zahawi said the government was working hard to improve social care support for children who through no fault of their own had been dealt a difficult hand in life he said we recently announced an additional m for adult and childrens social care in and we are also investing m over the next five years to build on our existing programmes which are developing innovative approaches to help children stay in a stable family home where it is best for them however childrens services leaders warned this week that the governments piecemeal approach was not good enough and fell woefully short of the sustainable funding needed for childrens services which face an estimated m annual budget shortfall stuart gallimore the president of the association of directors of childrens services said in a speech on wednesday that poverty was behind rising care numbers what our research has found quite clearly is that poverty as a result of the cumulative impacts of years of austerity and welfare reform is a primary cause of increased demand for early help and childrens social care the credit on the graph was amended on march because the data it was based on came from the department for education not the ons as an earlier version said,2018-11,number child care removed parent risk abuse

headteacher ian read recalls when children ran riot in the corridors of his primary school and told anyone reckless enough to intervene where to go but watercliffe meadow reads school in the deprived north sheffield community of shirecliffe has fought its way up the performance rankings by engaging with families so that new arrivals are better equipped to learn if you came here now you wouldnt think it was the same school because theyre just nice kids who want to learn and who value what we do for them read says clearly having more positive experiences at home is having an impact on their behaviour when they come here much of this success has come from projects such as families and schools together fast a partnership with save the children that helps local parents support their childs learning and development at home and deepens parental relationships with the school now the partnership plans to start even earlier when the child is just two if the standard health visitor check finds the family in difficulty some children arrive at school and they cant hold a pencil or they cant speak or theyre still in nappies says read adding that the social cost of failing to intervene early is enormous far too much money is spent on picking up the pieces later on he says in her vulnerability report pdf published in july englands childrens commissioner anne longfield estimated the cost of late intervention to acute and statutory services alone at bn a year while pointing out that the wider social and economic costs were far greater yet public spending on early intervention and youth services had fallen by since and million potentially highly vulnerable children had no professional support as the number of children in care reaches record levels councils face unprecedented pressure to divert their dwindling budgets into statutory services you cant lose almost of funding for childrens services nationally without making cuts says alison michalska director for children and adults at nottingham council pointing to the closure of youth services and childrens centres across england pdf p a recent guardian exclusive on the use of computer algorithms to identify families at risk of child abuse is just one example of the methods some councils are adopting to target scarce resources michalska has begun to turn the tide by investing in prevention to keep children out of the care system largely through intensive therapeutic work with families whose children would otherwise go into care and with teenagers vulnerable to knife crime or sexual exploitation nottinghams incare population has fallen by it is an investtosave approach predicated on what she describes as nottingham councils strong commercial outlook by making these changes were delivering m in savings every year and weve reinvested a lot of that into more prevention services that push down on our costs she says but i suspect that were coming to the end of investtosave unless the government starts to listen to those of us who are telling them there will be a bn funding gap by i just hope that somewhere a lightbulb switches on about investing in the future of our children critics claim that councils struggling to balance budgets are too narrowly focused on quick wins and need to take a longerterm view that looks beyond the balance sheet to determine success or failure the benefits of investing in prevention are wideranging accrue to multiple public services and agencies and often emerge some years down the line says donna molloy director of policy and practice at the early intervention foundation eif an independent charity and part of the governments what works network it is important we are clear about why these savings may not materialise otherwise early intervention will be seen as having failed to deliver teaching children social and emotional skills before and during their school years is a case in point and is one of more than wellevidenced and targeted interventions that the eif believes should be routine to access instead schools trimmed away more than of the time spent on these skills from to according to a study by the sutton trust foundation pdf which promotes social mobility if you track the longterm results these skills correlate with how well you do at school better mental health and less involvement in violent crime molloy says thats why the sutton trust findings are so depressing if you want to set children up for life and close the socioeconomic gap between disadvantaged and betteroff children social and emotional skills are core and fundamental in the absence of better financial incentives for more public services to get involved independent initiatives from the big lottery fund and the voluntary sector are staking a claim

at the last count there were children in england being cared for in a childrens home a secure unit or semiindependent accommodation with a further in settings such as residential special schools the childrens homes that care for the majority of these young people probably bear only a passing resemblance to popular stereotypes which range from sentimental to dystopian around threequarters of

children of all those in care lived in childrens homes residential care has fallen out of favour foster and kinship care is now seen as preferable in most circumstances but the remaining childrens homes provide an important service and many continue to do this difficult work well the system as a whole however is in the midst of a crisis produced by marketisation and the local authoritys

more than half of private nurseries have increased their fees in the past year and experts predict further rises are on the way as nursery owners struggle to make up the shortfall caused by insufficient funding for a flagship government policy official figures published by the department for education dfe and analysed by labour show of private nurseries in england have put up their fees in the past months along with around a quarter of school nurseries and childminders the widespread fee increases follow the implementation in september of a conservative manifesto pledge allowing working parents of three and fouryearolds to claim hours of childcare a week during term time weeks a year for free even if each parent earns up to nurseries and childminders repeatedly warned that the level of government funding allocated was insufficient and would force many childcare providers to raise fees charge parents for extras they didnt previously charge for or go bust the dfe research suggests at least half of the parents who took up the offer believing they would receive free childcare are now being asked by their provider to pay additional charges such as for lunches snacks special activities and outings even excluding these charges of parents eligible for the funding are still having to pay at least some fees each term per week on average among these parents one in seven are actually spending more on childcare now than they did before their child started receiving socalled free hours while are no better off at all neil leitch chief executive of the preschool learning alliance which represents nurseries said he was not surprised childcare providers were putting up their fees which labour predicts will impact over children systemic underfunding has left many providers struggling to break even forcing them to choose between increasing fees and risking closure and with the national living and minimum wages set to rise next april this financial pressure is only going to get worse only when ministers commit to increasing funding will providers be able to stop asking parents to pick up the governments tab the research reveals it is predominantly betteroff families who are benefiting from the extra bn a year set aside by the government to fund free childcare while the majority of families who earn or more have taken up the offer just a quarter of those earning under have done so suggesting childcare remains unaffordable for many lowincome parents the government originally promised the offer would save working parents up to a year per child commenting on the figures the labour mp and shadow early years minister tracy brabin said the tories flagship offer simply isnt living up the promises they made in the election and the consequences are being felt by parents across the country fees are rising free places come with hidden costs and too many families arent eligible for the support they need while nurseries and other providers are being pushed to the brink of bankruptcy shazia begum owner of the brighter futures nursery and preschool in malvern worcestershire is one of those providers she stopped paying herself a salary when the hours offer was introduced it was either that or go bust she said if i had refused to offer parents free hours they would have taken their children to another provider but the cost of providing those hours is higher than the government pays me she says she used to pay her staff more than the minimum wage but can no longer afford to i feel worried about the future of the sector to provide a good setting you need to recruit goodquality experienced staff due to rising costs she is planning to increase her fees in january but still does not expect to make enough to pay herself a salary nurseries are being forced out of business by the government i cant afford to make any more sacrifices if the government offers parents free childcare why dont they fund it correctly instead of making nurseries ask parents to pay minister for children and families nadhim zahawi said this government is doing more than any before to support parents with the cost of childcare we are investing record

labour has accused the government of failing to support hardpressed families after it emerged that a m underspend on its taxfree childcare tfc scheme is to be returned to the treasury the underspend on the troubled programme was uncovered by labour analysis of data from the office for budget responsibility obr which showed that spending on tfc is projected to be m lower than expected over the next four years the tfc scheme has been struggling to improve levels of uptake among families earlier warnings from the obr said the programme had helped less than of the families originally predicted and spending in the first year was just of initial forecasts instead of reallocating the m to support other childcare policies however the conservatives said the leftover funds would go back to government prompting fury from those working in the early years sector childcare providers say they are struggling to try to deliver the conservatives hour free childcare promise to working parents they say the tories flagship policy is underfunded and poses a risk to the financial sustainability of early years providers neil leitch chief executive of the preschool learning alliance called on the government to reinvest the leftover funds given that childcare providers across the country have long been crying out for additional funding the suggestion that government underspend on the taxfree childcare scheme is to be returned to the treasury rather than used to support a sector in crisis beggars belief he said such a decision suggests that preschools nurseries and childminders are being left to struggle not because the government simply doesnt have the money for additional investment but rather because it doesnt believe that there is a true need for it in the childcare sector the underspend confirms that uptake of taxfree childcare remains way below government projections either because parents dont understand their entitlement or theyre choosing not to take it up the shadow education secretary angela rayner said the fact that projected spending has fallen by hundreds of millions of pounds yet again means thousands of parents will not be getting the support they need with the cost of childcare the next labour government will guarantee hours of free childcare each week for all two to fouryearolds tom pursglove the conservative party vice chair for youth said with our balanced approach to the economy we are able to increase spending on childcare in real terms since to around bn a year by this includes delivering our commitment to provide working parents of

the rising tide of famous men named in the postweinstein era of the metoo movement has exposed what many of us have long understood to be true that powerful male genius is regarded not just as a law unto itself but as so essential to the world that it must be allowed to unfurl itself where and how it pleases were seeing this view expressed once again as geoffrey rushs defamation case against the daily telegraph continues rush is suing the sydney tabloid for publishing claims he behaved inappropriately towards a fellow performer while appearing in king lear for the sydney theatre company in april an affidavit filed to the federal court described rush as a virtually housebound figure who wakes up every morning with a terrible sense of dread about his future career rush denies the allegations and since they first appeared he has been predictably surrounded by a chorus of support from people who cannot help but worry about what irrevocable damage will be done to the world if one less man is heralded within it the same fears announced themselves during the confirmation hearings for brett kavanaugh will no one think of the mens prestigious careers but this collective angst is misplaced and not just because the protection offered to privileged men grossly overestimates their general importance to the world geoffrey rush is a fine enough actor but the world would quite easily survive not seeing him in another film or on stage he at least has had decades of opportunity you want to talk about ruined careers look at what happens to the women who dare to speak out against or refuse the advances of powerful men listen to whats been said about eryn jean norvill during the course of rushs defamation suit if the daily telegraph is guilty of anything it isnt the defamation of rush but the anxiety and tangible damage theyve invited upon a woman who did not consent to speaking publicly now viewed by many as orchestrating his apparent demise norvill isnt the only victim of this backlash harvey weinstein saw to it that the women who scorned him were blacklisted in hollywood the already finite window of time allowed to female actors slammed shut in their face because they refused to pay the toll of entry mira sorvino annabella sciorra rose mcgowan these are just some of the names we know whose careers were thwarted by a man who only now after decades of impunity has to face the possible consequences of this and what of the women whose work well never see at all because abuse trauma and exploitation derailed their carts before they even made it on to the tracks the artists the writers the orators the politicians the thinkers the musicians all the genius undoubtedly lost because the rights of powerful men to continuing making mistakes are still held as sacrosanct to integrity of culture how many women have been either forced out of their industries or chose to leave because the manmade obstacles being placed in their path became too mammoth to scale well might rush fret that his career is over but history shows the likelihood of that is slim to none it is infinitely more likely that norvill will suffer an impact just as christie whelan browne and erika heynatz feared would happen after they both spoke out against craig mclachlan there are other names of course men and at least one woman accused of using their fame as a cloak for their peccadillos there are even famous men who have admitted their behaviour although far fewer whove made genuine apologies for it why would they need to there are scores of onlookers willing to excuse them some of them driven by fandom and others simply by the belief that men in possession of power privilege and station should also be granted an extremely long leash but still people whine about how the collective shriek of womens anger and outrage will impact mens careers what will we do without louis ck some people cry are we just expected to throw out the works of picasso now to never watch the movies of woody allen again are you seriously expecting us to give up on generic white male writer who routinely screws young women cant we separate the aaaaaaart from the aaaaaaartist

the chair of the womens budget group has criticised the treasury for not publishing a comprehensive analysis of the gender equality impact of the budget arguing that men would benefit far more from the income tax giveaway professor diane elson wbg chair and emeritus professor at the university of essex told the treasury committee that of the gains from changes in income tax would go to men and to women between the tax years and thats not really surprising because we know that men have higher incomes than women and a lot of women are already below the tax threshold and wont benefit at all she said she noted that the treasury had worked out the impact by gender of all tax measures concluding that million people would benefit men and women but the failure to produce a full gender equality analysis of the budget including changes to benefits and spending pledges meant the uk government was not really fulfilling the public sector equality duty she said theyve done a little bit of analysis but they didnt publicise that and that didnt make them rethink the measures elson said she also noted that the bn spending boost for the national health service would mainly benefit women as they use the nhs more than men and largely staff the nhs paul johnson director of the institute for fiscal studies said he agreed with elsons comments adding that in households where men are the only earner it looks as though the benefit goes to the man but it might be shared between the couple he pointed out that the increase in the work allowance for universal credit would go partly to single parents who are largely women and that the big increases in the national living wage in recent years had mainly benefited women,2018-11,chair womens budget group ha criticised treasury publishing comprehensive analysis gender equality impact budget arguing men would benefit far income tax giveaway professor diane elson wbg chair emeritus professor university essex told treasury committee gain change income tax would go men woman tax year thats really surprising know men higher income woman lot woman already tax threshold wont benefit said noted treasury worked impact gender tax measure concluding million people would benefit men woman failure produce full gender equality analysis budget including change benefit spending pledge meant uk government wa really fulfilling public sector equality duty said theyve done little bit analysis didnt publicise didnt make rethink measure elson said also noted bn spending boost national health service would mainly benefit woman use nh men largely staff nh paul johnson director institute fiscal study said agreed elsons comment adding household men earner look though benefit go man might shared couple pointed increase work allowance universal credit would go partly single parent largely woman big increase national living wage recent year mainly benefited woman,"['chair', 'womens', 'budget', 'group', 'ha', 'criticised', 'treasury', 'publishing', 'comprehensive', 'analysis', 'gender', 'equality', 'impact', 'budget', 'arguing', 'men', 'would', 'benefit', 'far', 'income', 'tax', 'giveaway', 'professor', 'diane', 'elson', 'wbg', 'chair', 'emeritus', 'professor', 'university', 'essex', 'told', 'treasury', 'committee', 'gain', 'change', 'income', 'tax', 'would', 'go', 'men', 'woman', 'tax', 'year', 'thats', 'really', 'surprising', 'know', 'men', 'higher', 'income', 'woman', 'lot', 'woman', 'already', 'tax', 'threshold', 'wont', 'benefit', 'said', 'noted', 'treasury', 'worked', 'impact', 'gender', 'tax', 'measure', 'concluding', 'million', 'people', 'would', 'benefit', 'men', 'woman', 'failure', 'produce', 'full', 'gender', 'equality', 'analysis', 'budget', 'including', 'change', 'benefit', 'spending', 'pledge', 'meant', 'uk', 'government', 'wa', 'really', 'fulfilling', 'public', 'sector', 'equality', 'duty', 'said', 'theyve', 'done', 'little', 'bit', 'analysis', 'didnt', 'publicise', 'didnt', 'make', 'rethink', 'measure', 'elson', 'said', 'also', 'noted', 'bn', 'spending', 'boost', 'national', 'health', 'service', 'would', 'mainly', 'benefit', 'woman', 'use', 'nh', 'men', 'largely', 'staff', 'nh', 'paul', 'johnson', 'director', 'institute', 'fiscal', 'study', 'said', 'agreed', 'elsons', 'comment', 'adding', 'household', 'men', 'earner', 'look', 'though', 'benefit', 'go', 'man', 'might', 'shared', 'couple', 'pointed', 'increase', 'work', 'allowance', 'universal', 'credit', 'would', 'go', 'partly', 'single', 'parent', 'largely', 'woman', 'big', 'increase', 'national', 'living', 'wage', 'recent', 'year', 'mainly', 'benefited', 'woman']",43
the requirement that childcare costs must be paid in advance by those on universal credit directly conflicts with the aim of the new benefit system which is to get more people into work a new allparty report by mps says the work and pensions select committee argues that the way some of the poorest in society are having to pay childcare costs upfront then face weeks before they are reimbursed is a significant disincentive to moving into work the committee says that ministers should instead introduce direct payments of universal credit childcare costs to childcare providers which they say would lift the burden from parents while giving providers greater certainty over their incomes the committee says that the childcare payment arrangements are part of an inherently unfair system which benefits those on far higher incomes who receive help with their childcare through the tax system it is unacceptable that households claiming universal credit among them the poorest in society are struggling with childcare costs while the government is funding support for households earning up to a year via the taxfree childcare and freehours schemes the mps say the government should divert funding from those schemes towards improving universal credit childcare support the report is the latest to call into question a system that ministers say will help move back into work while also benefiting the economy and government finances earlier this year the national audit office said the bn universal credit system could end up costing more to administer than the system it replaces the nao said the system has been introduced too slowly was causing hardship and was not delivering value for money the committee chair frank field said if the government had set out to design a system to make it harder for parents to get into work it could hardly have done better its not just driving parents into despair and debt and creating problems for childcare providers its also actively working to prevent the government achieving its aim of getting more people into work and it is simply irresponsible of government to suggest that the way around this policys inherent problems is for

despite much recent loud insistence to the contrary the ancient order of male power in fact remains intact its grip on our western moment unrelenting the endofyear roundup season obliges a reckoning with the strange paradox of feminist time which passes both with shocking speed and seemingly not at all recent events suggest saddeningly maddeningly the more things change the more inventive new ways to reinforce the old disadvantage of women can be found to recap in october women celebrated for lack of an english verb that embraces both achievement and despair a year since allegations against hollywood heavyweight harvey weinstein precipitated the mass revelations of metoo twelve months reflection determined that the initial feminist optimism provoked by the collective acknowledgment of wrongdoing was perhaps misplaced remember when catherine deneuve and a hundred others put their name to a letter insisting as women that metoo had become a witch hunt that happened as early and recently as january metoo movement founder tarana burke explained earlier this month that patriarchal retribution had been swift suddenly a movement to centre survivors of sexual violence is being talked about as a vindictive plot against men said burke victims are heard and then vilified dont believe her ask yourself whats happened to christine blasey ford since airing allegations against us supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh she was humiliated he was appointed that only happened this october in australia a woman accused former opposition leader luke foley of misconduct a mere month and at least one political lifetime ago foley denies the claims but a mooted defamation case is not proceeding defamation cases have however been commenced by craig mclachlan and geoffrey rush against media outlets they claim have falsely accused them of inappropriate sexual conduct whatever their outcome clamours for the magistrate have been audible lending feminisms eternal maverick

february the same month that one of the australian liberalnational governments few female ministers sat down against the sisterhood choosing senate estimates as the appropriate forum to slutshame the female staff of the opposition leader michaelia cashs remarks were speedily retracted yet their cultural context remains note that the reelected government of victoria may have delivered gender parity to its newly minted ministerial cabinet but it is only australias one state government after queensland to do manage it the federal government not all all federally the current conservative government retains so few female mps now that cabinet parity is barely possible numerically all year weve been discussing how the liberal leadership of this country resists a quota system to represent the female of the population while reserving cabinet spots for the national party even though their representation of contemporary australian values remains somewhat in the niche of ones estranged uncle who went a bit funny after he went to live out on that farm there have been some victories for women the repeal of irelands coercive and cruel forced birth policy a policy that infamously killed a miscarrying indian national was delivered with the resounding majority that only a true paradigm shift in values towards recognising womens humanity can achieve touching solidarity between labor and would you believe it the national party also instituted safe access zones for women around termination clinics in new south wales even if abortion itself remains technically a criminal act in that state it is some miracle no longer so in queensland after a successful exhausting campaign of feminists and allies to change the law there yet remember the women of america in your prayers the appointment of

dor for womens football and being asked by a male dj to twerk on descending the stage theres the phenomenon of cloudlighting where youtube pranksters douse their girlfriends tampons with chilli tell them their pets have died and insult them on camera for public casual lulz the twitch video game streamer whose alleged physical attacks on his crying girlfriend were made in audio range of his audience the oecd report insisting that a comparatively low labour force participation of australian single mothers isnt due to lack of affordable accessible childcare but welfare incentives that support womens care of their children after the kids reach independence at um the reports of men refusing to meet or work alongside women colleagues for fear of being metooed progress at this point looks like a process of small consolations at least the dj apologised for his twerking remarks at least the youtuber who humiliated his girlfriend has admitted his error and took the video down at least a horrified audience called the cops on the streamer at least the graphs on the oecd report betray the truth its countries with comprehensive early childhood care that most help women back into the workforce and at least the men who fear theyll be accused of misconduct or rape are taking themselves out of the situations to do it dudes we dont want to have dinner with you really the events

the morning before i was presenting a paper at a beat generation studies conference in paris the babysitter id arranged to watch my daughter texted to say she couldnt make it worried id have to cancel the presentation i asked the organizers two men if they knew of any lastminute babysitters bring her they said were fathers of six kids between us well watch her so with trepidation i did while i presented my work in an auditorium the director and my moderator entertained my daughter by letting her draw on the whiteboard and then to my horror the walls during the qampa my daughter demanded to nurse as she did her diaper leaked on to my pants afterward several people came up to me to laud my bringing her a middleaged woman reminisced that one of her favorite memories was bringing her daughter to her thesis defense unfortunately my experience is not the norm for most working women bringing their children to work or having a flexible schedule is not an option when flexibility is offered like in the case of this londonbased investment banker it comes with a huge caveat advancement is less likely for parents usually mothers who request flexibility this can hit single parents currently of us children live in singleparent households particularly hard while one solution may be for companies to offer new parents the ability to bring their babies to their workplace or offer onsite childcare as of only companies had official policies allowing children to be present at a workplace during working hours and of course there are many industries construction factory work and medicine for example where allowing children at the workplace would be dangerous moreover it is often those parents who are in most need of flexibility single parents or those in lowwage jobs who are least likely to have it i have been deeply privileged to have a partner who works a more traditional job so i could take time to build a career with more flexibility for child rearing i cofounded a remotework startup published a novel and went on a book tour all while a new mother yet my partner regularly scoffs when i ask him to bring our daughter to work with him what would his clients think company culture and industry standards obviously play a huge role in the bring a kid to work idea when an industry like my partners real estate finance is made up almost entirely of men it becomes even more difficult to shift the culture though i was pleased to overhear him recently on a call from home say im working from home today so you may hear my toddler screaming which precipitated a longer parenting conversation with his client also a father while not common bringing children to work is a rising phenomenon and seemingly most visible in governance take new zealands prime minister jacinda ardern for example ardern made news for bringing her threemonthold to the un general assembly in september recognizing her circumstances are different from the general publics she said if i can do one thing and that is change the way we think about these things then i will be pleased we have achieved something likewise australian senator larissa waters was lauded last year for breastfeeding her baby while voting on a resolution in parliament closer to home illinois senator tammy duckworth successfully spearheaded a groundbreaking resolution to allow children under the age of one on to the us senate floor in a less deliberate case of workplacefamily intersection theres the viral video of professor robert kellys children bursting on to the scene of his bbc interview the incident raised a variety of questions about why he didnt address the presence of his children as well as arguments about how his wife retrieved the children interestingly kelly said he thought the intrusion of his children meant hed blown it in front of the whole world kellys assumption that the visibility of his children during the interview would somehow tarnish his credibility as an academic speaks to the fact that we still harbor assumptions that our children arent welcome and that its unprofessional to take an interview or a work call while home yet in a survey of working adults said they spent some time working remotely like the widespread support for kellys mishap his older child even became an internet meme i am fortunate i never felt my childs presence was offensive to my audience not even when she ran on to the stage at a beijing literary festival crawled on my lap and started nursing to the contrary many students in the audience especially women noted it was inspiring and empowering that i wasnt ashamed of my intersecting role of mother and professional and why should i be the reality is that most americans can no longer rely on the traditional nuclear family to raise the next generation our villages have dissolved and while we often call on family friends or as is usually the case paid childcare to fill in the gaps the idea that our work identities are somehow fully separate from our home selves clearly has damaging consequences for all women often feel like theyre failing as mothers and in their careers doing it all has really just meant the bulk of the emotional labor in a household falls to women i wonder what the world would look like if children were more integrated into the workplace what if more parents and given the gender pay gap especially women had access to resources that allowed them the ability to balance family and career what if and heres a big wish caring for another human being was considered valuable work even something worthy of mentioning on a rsum one of my earliest fondest memories of my mother is the click of her heels on our hardwood floors on the mornings she readied for work although she only worked parttime at a small insurance agency she inherited from her parents i knew the office well the smell of burnt coffee the typewriter id play with while my mother worked as a child i didnt realize how lasting that influence would be how i respected both my mothers independence at work and also her introduction of me to her working self in bringing this generation of children to working events or offices were teaching them a valuable lesson about worklife balance as well as the intersecting identities we inhabit on a daily basis my hope is that when these children become our worlds leaders theyll remember we didnt shut them out of work spaces as a result they will build the policies and support systems for a more equitable and enjoyable workplace kaitlin solimine is an awardwinning

before they sit down in a conference room in a new york hotel tarana burke and steve mcqueen have never met but they share an interest in social justice sexual violence in particular how the trauma of assault plays down the generations and questions of how victim representation is policed in pop culture burke is the bronxborn senior director of girls for gender equality a lifelong educator and activist and most recognisably the founder of the metoo movement which years before the alleged victims of harvey weinstein came forward was set up to work with survivors of sexual trauma mcqueen is the english director of years a slave which won best picture at the oscars and most recently directed widows starring viola davis the heist movie was in production in chicago when the metoo story broke and says mcqueen cast and crew talked and talked and talked and listened and listened more importantly for me stupid to say but i was shocked together they discuss the astonishing testimonies unleashed by metoo as well as the backlash and how burke and mcqueen would like to see the movement better served by the media particularly the racial and class implications of who gets to be a good victim they talk about their families roots in the west indies and disagree very mildly on the place held by women within black lives matter burke is passionate ferocious often very humorous about the contradictions and frailties of the metoo movement and the vision developed over decades of unglamorous and largely unrecognised work underpinning it mcqueen meanwhile is curious softspoken and deferential to the expertise of the woman before him it is a fascinating conversation steve mcqueen lets just start i think that what youve done has been extraordinarily influential youve shifted everything and people are thinking about things that happened to them in the past and unearthing things that have been suppressed its incredible tarana burke yes and on both sides i think survivors have suppressed things and so have perpetrators who now have a different understanding of consent sm i knew there would be a backlash misogyny is like a vampire youve got to wake him up at dawn put silver pennies on his eyes shoot him with silver bullets and put a stake through his heart as a black person i cant be anything other than who i am or be looked upon in other peoples gaze as who they think i am but white women who come into this conversation theres an easy way out tb ok and youre saying that versus sm i dont want to mansplain but as far as i see things with my mother and my sister or my siblings theres a double tb whammy sm yes to being a black woman tb oh absolutely i was talking the other day about a book called all the women are white all the blacks are men but some of us are brave sm great title tb right and one of the things it deals with is the erasure not just from the movement but in general of black women for whom theres a choice do i choose to be black first or do i choose to be a woman sm wait do you have to make a choice is there a choice tb there is often a pull to make a choice when black lives matter took off i was involved in say her name which is a movement about saying the names of the black women who were also subjected to police brutality and i was told youre trying to distract from these black men being killed these black men are losing their lives number one black women also get killed although largely sexually assaulted by police a lot of people when they say black lives matter they mean black mens lives matter sm do you think that i dont know if i agree tb i think that what the men will say is absolutely not were talking about all black people but when you see the difference in the rallying around for example the sister who was killed by the police in baltimore yearold korryn gaines who was shot in there was nowhere near the groundswell of support there was around trayvon martin or eric garner you cannot get black men to come out in force in the ways that we do for them or the ways they do for black men sm so to go back to my convoluted question about white women coming into the debate tb you mean how committed are they one of the backlashes that ive seen this year is a contingent of conservative white women who are saying things like these women are responsible for what happened to them and youre trying to attack my son my husband my brother like around supreme court justice brett kavanaugh there are tons of white women who supported him which i think is a case of them being invested in the white men in their lives interests more than their own then there are the white women on the other side who are more liberal and who centre womens experience but when they say women they mean white women sm the irony is that the thing that made metoo visible throughout the world was white women tb and i have said publicly that i dont have an issue with that sm whatever works tb right ive been at this work along with so many other women of colour for years and nothing that we couldve done wouldve elevated this issue into the international spotlight im a yearold black woman from the bronx who the media tries to ignore in some ways who will acknowledge me as the person who coined the phrase metoo or as the founder but not the leader they are constantly looking for other leadership sm yes ive heard journalists say that in metoo and times up there are no black leaders and ive thought what why is that tb because they cant see us let me say that alyssa milano who put out the first tweet in october has spent this whole year passing the mic she was corrected by black women largely changed the tweet immediately to recognise burke and from that time on when people call her she passes it on to me sm thats good tb but regardless they still will erase me due diligence in the media is to say alyssa milano the leader of the metoo movement and then in parentheses original phrase coined by tarana burke in and i dont know how to say this without it sounding like i should be the king im not saying that im saying that because of the investment in the work there should at least be a conversation that says theres a bigger vision sm thats why racism is so huge its ginormous thats the thing thats deafening tb its the thread that runs through your narrative is being erased by these public perceptions set up by the media theres this real conundrum of people who celebrate me as an individual but still wont buy into what im saying because theyre inundated with headlines about who the metoo movements going to take down next sm when metoo hit we were in the middle of making widows in chicago and we just sat down and talked i was shocked about certain things i was like really oh wow tb whats interesting is that if we woke up tomorrow and million people had a disease because thats what these people said me too ive got it too the whole world would stop there would be three questions how did we get here how do we stop it and how do we make sure it never happens again those three questions havent been answered in a year its so commonplace that most of us dont even think about it sm thats what shocked me the normalisation of someone touching you inappropriately it freaked me out a bit tb youre married right sm yes well ive had a partner for years and we have two children tb did you talk to your wife about it sm yes i did and she said some things i dont want to talk about that were very tb eyeopening sm yes again its heavy i wish i could articulate it better but i was also ashamed of myself in a way that i wasnt sensitive enough to know about this and maybe id normalised a certain behaviour not that id participated but i never thought of it i think what you did is wake a lot of people up to a certain pain that they had tb in widows which i watched last night theres a scene where one of the women is regularly abused by her husband and you see her with a black eye and theyre sitting at breakfast and he kind of plays around with her face and says put some makeup on that makes me uncomfortable and youd think when he died shed be like yay and thats not how it happens she still has this loyalty to him its nuanced i thought that was a really interesting scene sm i think theres a kind of recklessness that comes after someone close to you has died you realise your mortality theres a sort of liberation that character alice her mother hits her too and thats conditioning tb my daughter mentioned that sm interestingly enough im from a west indian family tb where are your family from sm from grenada and trinidad tb indicating herself st kitts sm whats interesting is that violence i was beaten as a child tb nodding vigorously oh yeah sm its interesting how that violence is normalised tb i think theres something about how in marginalised communities in our fervour to make sure our kids dont get into trouble we overdo some stuff theres a way that black parents inundate our children with rules and girls get it more so than anything sm absolutely tb things like you dont let anybody touch your private parts you dont sit on a grown mans lap theres a list i could run through we all got that and its an effort to keep your children safe what happened in my case i was six the first time was that you have the rules and the number one thing kids want to accomplish is not getting into trouble we will do anything not to get in trouble sm right you dont want to get licked tb right part of the grooming in our community is you did something wrong you have to protect this secret if soandso finds out youre going to get in trouble there are these narratives we have to undo in our community that come from you know bursts out laughing years a slave sm laughing precisely to state the obvious violence selfperpetuates down the generations a lot of healing needs to be done tb so i have a question for you one of the things im interested in is pop culture narratives around sexual violence and the depiction of who gets to be a victim and who doesnt do you feel a sense of responsibility do you feel a pushpull around wanting to be a part of shifting the narrative and wanting to be superauthentic does that make sense sm i think one wants to be part of shifting the narrative absolutely somehow theres got to be a way of imagining a situation where sex and the pleasures of sex are much more in balance and much more enjoyable where both people have equal engagement i think thats way more sexy tb yes theres ways to make consent sexy sm the whole idea of men showing vulnerability is an issue that has to be addressed where its not a weakness its a huge advantage the dumbness about how this interaction has been popularised is absolutely crazy tb to make male vulnerability sexy would be amazing i have a friend in the bdsm world and we had this really wonderful conversation once about what the world can learn from bdsm because its all based on consent sm yup tb it may be distasteful to people because of our puritanical whatever but its not about engaging in the acts its about taking lessons from that although when this person told me about it i said i dont think the worlds ready for the metoo movement to start pushing ideas about bdsm both laugh were still trying to get folks to get comfortable with the idea that sexual assault is wrong sm youve gone to the seed of the question i think once people have an idea about how to talk about it or popularise it thats when things will be dealt with but its healing first we cant jump the gun tb healing is also something that has to be popularised i think that folks engage from a place of pity even the narratives you see in the media about victimhood are about the brokendown person we need to see more than that there are so many survivors who dont understand that healing is possible because they have been conditioned to think of someone in a hot bubble bath with candles or meditating these commercialised ideas that healing has a beginning a middle and an end this was what i realised about dr christine blasey ford that many people dont understand the lifecycle of a survivor those millions of people who came forward and said metoo were not talking about things that happened the day before this is years of stuff and responses to it are highly gendered when men come forward to say they were molested by priests when they were children you dont hear people push back and say why did you wait so long why didnt you go to the police but when women come forward its oh what were you wearing did you entice that person same thing with race often ive said that while sexual violence does not discriminate our response is highly racial around who gets to be a victim and who gets sympathy we are all socialised to respond to the vulnerability of white women first so you have the biggest names in hollywood theyre thin beautiful wealthy glamorous white women top of the food chain we want to know everything about them what they eat who theyre married to so its no surprise that wed want to know about this part of their lives that was broken too i definitely dont blame them they are also survivors its not their fault the world responds to them that way but they can also use that spotlight to amplify other folks who get less visibility sm i just wish that could also be done racially tb you mean around sexual violence within race yes thats another layer to peel back when bill cosby happened there was an incredible backlash within the community these women are lying hes americas dad all that every possible reason it wasnt true that was painful sm very painful tb it brought up this complicated conversation because we know theres a very real history of black men being falsely accused of sexual assault by white women thats not a debatable fact we know it from emmett till the other thing we know is that when any violence happens in a community its at the hands mostly of the people in that community so that means asian men are raping asian women white men are raping white women black men are raping black women when it comes to black folks because of that complicated history around false accusations it becomes a shield not to deal with sexual violence at all sm its also to do with the fact that bill cosby or mike tyson we dont want them taken down by a largely white media tb you hear people say oh cosby has to go to jail but harvey weinstein and matt lauer didnt and my response is so we should not hold any black men accountable till all the white men go to jail thats what were waiting for but what you said is right we dont want to take down our icons were invested in their success in a way that is detrimental to our own sm i understand it in a way but in order for us to grow we have to deal with it tb i dont know what the solution is if a group of black women actresses or singers came forward together like with weinstein and said this thing happened that would shift things so dramatically they would still catch a hell of a backlash more than white women but i have based my work on the black women who did talk about their experiences i would go into the classroom and say mary j blige queen latifah oprah are all survivors of sexual violence and they could connect to that sm when there are black men facing sexual harassment allegations the media just goes to town goes to town tb like ray rice the nfl player caught on video beating his wife he knocked her out and dragged her out of the elevator it was horrific but then this thing happened where he became sm a monster tb a monster so your point about it coming back to race it creates these dynamics where were conflicted sm it comes back to the metoo movement and how theres a situation where some people dont even know you exist it does my head in it all comes back to perception to stereotypes tb ive talked about my personal struggle around this if you erase me then you erase the vision for this work and thats problematic if you keep saying she coined the phrase laughs it erases even my credibility to talk about it sm i think the only way of doing it is to say you need more black journalists people who have independence in the media a bigger reach because right now even making this picture widows is dependent on some white persons

childrens social services have been bitten hard by governmentimposed financial cuts since politicallychosen austerity has led to poor children and families moving from deprivation to destitution and the help they might have received has been stripped away the consequence is more concerns about the safety and welfare of children leading to a increase in child protection investigations since and the number of children in council care rising from to more than the local government association predicts that by there will be a bn funding gap just to maintain childrens services at what is already a threadbare patchwork quilt shredded by years of cuts central government grants to local government have halved over the past eight years the government intends this trend to continue despite childrens services budgets already overspending by m a year services are shrinking but still overspending while the funding pot is being repeatedly squeezed but there is another dimension to the childrens social services crisis the pot is not only being squeezed it is leaking what had been a trickle of public funding for childrens services taken as profits by private companies is now a steady stream the private sector has substantially infiltrated and colonised childrens social services and social work with big money being made by the owners and senior managers of commercial companies just look at what has already happened in england almost threequarters of childrens homes in england are privately owned and managed and almost half of all local authorities do not provide and manage any childrens homes almost a third of all children in foster care in england live with foster carers provided through private agencies in corporate watch reported that eight private foster care agencies there are many more made profits of more than m while also making big payments to senior managers one of the biggest agencies recently sold itself on to a hedge fund with its two previous owners likely to have received a substantial financial windfall private employment agencies are also making big money out of providing interim agency social workers managers and even whole teams to local authority childrens social services almost of childrens social workers in english local authorities are agency staff two private employment agencies made millions of pounds in profit in from providing social workers to local councils and their senior managers were each paid more than the extent to which companies have dug into and captured childrens social work is not only deep but also wide it includes companies being funded by central government to shape the future education and accreditation of childrens social workers and managing the shortterm money the government is making available for innovation in childrens social services trumpeted as additional funding but minuscule when set alongside the real reduction in government grant why should any of this be of much concern first money that should be helping children and families in difficulty is instead ending up in the pockets of those who are already rich this is particularly awful at a time when budgets are being decimated second it is undermining quality creating fragmentation and lack of continuity and the turnover of agency staff means the history of the children and their families is largely unknown to social workers who have little chance of building relationships of trust and care third accountability and transparency have been blown away private companies can hide behind commercial confidentiality the concept of local authorities as a caring corporate parent is challenged when they depend on shortterm agency social workers themselves largely unknown to the council arranging and overseeing childrens placements amid poorer services costing more money it surely would be timely to turn off the tap pouring profits to private companies the government and senior civil servants may favour the private sector but stopping public funds being taken as private profit is a sensible step to take and to start to take quickly ray jones new book in whose interest the privatisation of child protection and

insurance giant aviva revealed last month that its innovative scheme offering new dads six months paid parental leave has proved a big hit with staff and shows men are eager to share childcare duties the scheme offers equal parental leave to male and female employees up to one year in the uk including six months at full pay aviva says there has been strong takeup since it was introduced months ago while lots of employers would doubtless say there is no way they could afford to offer that sort of benefit to staff many people would probably argue that something needs to be done bearing in mind that the latest data shows that the number of uk fathers taking paternity leave has fallen on top of that the governments shared parental leave scheme introduced three years ago has seen very poor takeup as low as when i was pregnant with my daughter in my husband and i had a discussion about parental leave at the time i was the higher earner working as a copywriter for a tech startup and we decided he would go down to a threeday week so that i could return to work parttime soon after the birth of course the ideas you have during pregnancy are often wildly unaligned with the realities of new parenthood i hadnt considered the physical implications of pregnancy and childbirth i could barely walk initially and took a year to fully heal also i was breastfeeding our daughter which made her very reliant on me we never mentioned shared leave again my husband returned to fulltime work after just less than two weeks off and i looked after the baby living off the savings i had accumulated he helped in the mornings and evenings but i was the primary care giver then in new legislation was passed entitling parents to request shared parental leave during their babys first year the mother would be obliged to take two weeks leave but following that it would be up to the couple as to how they split the remaining weeks with statutory pay of up to a week see below but earlier this year the government disclosed that while about couples are eligible for the leave each year takeup could be as low as it admitted that about half of the public are unaware that the option even exists meanwhile according to research by law firm emw there was a drop in the number of fathers who took any paternity leave in the months to march to down from the year before there is the possibility that some fathers might not know shared parental leave is even an option or be able to afford to take the leave if they are the higher earner jon taylor at emw cites a rise in gig economy workers as another barrier if you are juggling several jobs it will be harder to take time out to look after a baby and yet there are certainly couples who make it work sara tateno founder of parentchild activity website happity was keen to split parental leave with her husband she took the first six months of leave then handed over to her husband for the next three months she says i was worried about how my husband would cope and i was still breastfeeding so i had to sit in a cupboard to pump at lunchtime but i was much more comfortable leaving my baby with his dad than with a stranger and while i was sad to miss some of my sons milestones i was glad my husband got to have that experience with him because id had months off with our eldest i was really absorbed by my work so i knew it was worth it there will be other mothers who have a supportive employer and willing partner but feel similarly conflicted about shared parental leave women who understand the importance of fathers bonding with their babies and who would like to continue developing their own careers but are then faced with for instance limited options for expressing breast milk in the workplace having to overcome hurdles such as this at an already sensitive time may put new mothers off sharing parental leave at all especially when coupled with the fact that many mothers are still experiencing high levels of exhaustion back pain urinary incontinence and perineal pain several months after giving birth edinburghbased charity researcher rosie tylergreig agreed to split parental leave with her partner but is dreading the twomonth period when she will return to work im meant to be returning when our baby is four months old and then going back on leave from six to nine months she says but i cant tell you how much sadness i feel when i think about months four to six i rather forgot how emotional breastfeeding is when we requested shared parental leave samantha lilleytoon a mindfulness teacher from leeds felt similarly i definitely wanted to be with my baby and i think women need as much time as possible to recover physically after birth before returning to work she says i didnt feel right six months after birth more like months if you continue breastfeeding you maintain all those hormones like relaxin that affect mobility and strength ultimately like all parenting decisions this one needs to be made between the two adults involved they might conclude that the higher earner returns to work or perhaps one parent feels keen to advance their career rather than look after the baby but the issue here is that men generally earn more and women are expected to take the time out of their career however this wasnt the case with boma jaja and his wife malvina benitezcastillo they have two sons aged nine and seven and jaja is the primary caregiver benitezcastillo took six months maternity leave with both boys before returning to her nhs nursing job at which point jaja took over shed worked hard for her degree and to build a career theres no way i was going to make her give it up he says jaja who runs a vintage furniture shop in walthamstow northeast london says the government almost needs to force men to take the shared leave that is now on offer because the kids need them and they need that time though he acknowledges that as a business owner he is in a position to fit his paid work around family life its not so easy for every dad to do it a dummys guide to qualify for shared parental leave spl the parent who wishes to take it must have been continuously employed by the same employer for at least weeks up to the end of the th week before the expected week of childbirth they must have a partner who has been employed or selfemployed for at least weeks not necessarily continuously in the period of weeks leading up to the expected week of childbirth and must have earned at least a week on average in of those weeks a mother must take the two weeks after birth as compulsory leave four weeks for factory workers so the maximum leave and pay that is available to share is weeks spl weeks statutory shared parental pay statutory maternity pay is paid for up to weeks at of the mothers average earnings for the first six weeks and a flat rate of per week for weeks or of the mothers average earnings if this is less than statutory paternity pay is or of your average earnings whichever is lower it felt a huge privilege standing in my living room on a weekday morning three years ago trying to contort my body into a baby bjorn papoose i wondered if i was out of my depth the youtube video i was watching said the buckle system was easy but it felt like id dislocated my shoulder this was three days into a fourmonth stint of shared parental leave id signed up for this well before any actual baby was on the scene four months off work hell yeah stay at home with my son rather than face the daily commute definitely im in foolishly i thought i might get some reading done id seen my partner get into the swing of it sure there had been complaints of tiredness and some grumpiness but she was probably exaggerating right wrong it was an introduction to a whole new kind of exhaustion the exhaustion of the hypervigilant parent from monitoring every sharp object near the fearless crawler to preventing unidentified filth from entering his gummy mouth this was exactly what my partner had been talking about suddenly i appreciated the real value of shared parental leave its not just doing a block of childcare to help out its sharing the pain guilt uncertainty fear shock and utter joy of being the primary carer it eases the pressure on the relationship during a crazy time if youve both been in that role then you both know what its like to be stuck indoors with a teething postimmunised infant i found too that it strengthened the bond between my son and me he became less crazysleepysuitofmadness and more of a little buddy and when i came to be the one who was there when he was hungry or tired or had bonked his head the more he understood i was a source of comfort too that effort has lasted into his toddler years and i hope long beyond that the financial burden can be tricky at one point i felt i had returned to student days only with a small sleepy friend with no money rather than stoner friends with no money however if its within the realm of possibility to do it the rewards can be enormous i was awestruck watching my son trying to figure out how to do things it felt a huge privilege to have the opportunity to give him my full attention in those early moments i never regretted taking that time and who knows maybe one day he can help me figure out the papoose adam dewar,2018-12,insurance giant aviva revealed last month innovative
