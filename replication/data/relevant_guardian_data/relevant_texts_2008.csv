why is there still public silence about violence against women and children because tackling the question of violence against women and children means addressing the very roots of patriarchy reported cases are increasing so why are fewer aggressors being convicted one explanation is that as the courage of the victims increases and they report violence more often the backlash organised by the aggressors increases are there any issues particular to britain compared with other countries you looked at in many industrialised countries including britain central issues are child contact with an abusive parent and what to do about men who have been violent what provisions could change the situation of women and children in britain stop blaming mothers for their own victimisation and give positive support to nonabusive parents mostly mothers how do british antiviolence policies work compared with other countries in the uk there is a coherent and coordinated effort to reduce violence against women and children involving social activists researchers and stakeholders is there a cultural impact or background that increases violence in social contexts or cultures where women have fewer rights there is generally more violence what policies would reduce the sexual violence that exists against women and children first we must dismantle a culture in which men think they have a right to possess women and children and then the widespread prejudice that victims of sexual violence are usually lying does poverty cause sexual violence or child abuse certainly not but poverty may play a part in entrapping a woman in a violent relationship and can make it more difficult for her to protect her children why did you write a book on this subject as a researcher a university professor and an activist i was outraged by the extent of the coverup of violence against women and children i felt a scientific and a moral duty to contribute to opposing this trend a deafening

the police are pressing for a domestic violence register similar to the sex offenders list to enable them to track those who repeatedly attack others the association of chief police officers said yesterday they wanted the list to help keep tabs on the violent people who moved from one abusive relationship to another brian moore the wiltshire chief constable and acpo spokesman also told mps yesterday that the murders sparked by domestic abuse could be halved if a statutory duty was placed on schools housing and social services departments and the police to share information about domestic violence incidents the commons home affairs select committee was told that the scale of domestic violence remained hugely underreported to the police a survey estimated there could be as many as m incidents a year victim support said last year it helped domestic violence victims yet only cases ended in a conviction moore told the mps those who go from relationship to relationship across boundaries should be subject to some form of proportionate tracking he said that despite repeated home office guidance there was inadequate sharing of information each agency may have part of the picture but it is only when all these pieces of information come together that we can have the clearest picture of those who are at risk moore said that some places used the data protection act and claims of client confidentiality as reasons for not sharing information but it was time to set obligations on the availability of information when people were at risk of attacks we have to act now because year on year other people are losing their lives because of this gap in the law there are thousands of protocols about sharing information thousands of protocols must tell you that there is no clear system moore later said that the number of murders each year arising from domestic incidents including of men could be halved if the law was changed a domestic violence register would hold a database based on the or so successful convictions a year the mps also heard evidence from judges that the new nonmolestation orders implemented in july had already run into trouble because of failure

one night tasneen ahmeds husband finally went too far she was used to him hitting her but this time he didnt stop while their small children looked on he punched her repeatedly pulled her about by her hair and when she fell to the floor started kicking her in the stomach in hospital the doctors said they would have to wait for the bruising on her face to go down before they could treat her injuries a broken nose a shattered cheekbone ahmed not her real name avoids eye contact her smile is a rare fleeting thing speaking through an interpreter she says i was a happy woman when i left pakistan i came with great hopes into this country she starts quietly crying after it all started i thought is this what my life is going to be like from now on am i never going to be happy her decision to leave her husband and bring charges against him has put her in danger it is not uncommon for women in her position to be threatened with violence yet despite these risks she is not in a safe house or womens refuge no organisation in her adopted town of rochdale greater manchester will take her in ahmed is one of a littleknown group of people classed as nrpf no recourse to public funds in britain on a twoyear probationary visa these women primarily but not solely from the asian subcontinent have no right to public aid even if a marriage breaks down because of violent abuse with no money often speaking little english and with little knowledge of britains laws they are confronted with a brutal choice stay in an abusive relationship in fear of their lives or leave and face destitution paul rowen liberal democrat mp for rochdale has taken up the issue in the house of commons after a trainee social worker compiled a report in september last year revealing that at that time women were facing destitution in rochdale alone its appalling that this is happening in the st century he says if there are a significant number of women in a small town like rochdale then it is happening to other women throughout the country the immigration system in this country is so rulebound that it fails to take into account situations like this we are missing the human dimension councils throughout the country are struggling to meet the demands of destitute migrants such as ahmed a report by the specialist nrpf team at islington council in north london found that local authorities across england and wales had been put under financial strain after caring for sick and destitute migrants left unsupported by the state it accused the government of using destitution to force people to leave caught between legislation that obliges them to act as a safety net including the children act and the european convention on human rights and no funding to pay for that support they are increasingly finding themselves unable to provide help for women with no recourse this squeeze on local authority budgets means that it is becoming increasingly difficult to place vulnerable women says nisha shabeen not her real name a project worker at a community centre in rochdale it has been getting harder to find somewhere for them to go she says before refuges would take them but recently they wont even tell us if there are spaces if the woman is nrpf the reason for that is simple refuges depend for their survival on housing benefit which women with no recourse cannot receive so while refuges may want to help the options are limited deportation the number of people affected is small but significant according to nonprofit organisation southall black sisters sbs which estimates that about women a year who arrive in the uk as dependants become victims of domestic violence preliminary findings from a report by imkaan an organisation that supports black minority ethnic and refugee refuges suggest that in a twoyear period in london alone there were applications from women of whom had children who were refused access to emergency housing and support but the number may be much higher women may be threatened with deportation by their new families if the marriage breaks down the woman is expected to return to her country of origin so many stay silent if a woman can prove her marriage broke down because of domestic violence she can apply for permanent leave to remain under the domestic violence rule introduced in after a campaign led by sbs but she still has no recourse to public funds undoubtedly the domestic violence rule has saved lives says hannana siddique joint coordinator at sbs but its effectiveness is undermined by the no recourse requirement on the one hand the government is saying it wants to protect women from domestic violence or forced marriage but in reality these women are forced to stay in abusive situations the government must do something to protect all victims of domestic violence including those groups with insecure immigration status applications for residency under the domestic violence rule can take up to two years to process and because of cuts to legal aid applicants must find to have their case considered these are women who havent got enough money to buy milk for their child shabeen says just how are they meant to find domestic violence can be difficult to prove and not all women suffer physical abuse such as one woman who was abandoned by her husband after her three children died from the same birth defect if someone is abandoned with nothing then that is abuse says rowen these women left destitute through no fault of their own deserve our compassion and support ahmed is one of the lucky ones a family member has temporarily taken her in but with people crammed into a threebedroom house she cannot hope to stay there for long if my cousin had not been here for me i cant even think about what would have happened she says other women face bleaker choices in london some travel through the long dark hours on night buses to stay warm many return to abusive relationships others become victims of predatory men according to shabeen the dire lack of secure housing leaves these women exposed to economic and sexual exploitation as soon as the men find out a woman is on her own she is very vulnerable she says they will go out and hunt her sadia ashiq who dealt with nine women with no recourse over a period of five months while she was working at rochdales homelessness unit says the system is creating an underground sex industry she cites a case where a woman with no recourse had taken the offer of shelter from a family friend a year later she had had four terminations and attempted to take her own life these women find it difficult to get jobs they just dont have the skills or speak english she says they are employed by asian relatives or socalled wellwishers they will house them and a few months later the women are pregnant she says many people are reluctant to talk about this aspect of the issue for fear of being labelled racist its on the increase and if anyone is making out its not there theyre crazy she insists the issue must be dealt with sensitively but head on according to rowen he says this has nothing to do with religion it is not an attack on islam its a cultural problem and it is about respect for human dignity to confront the issue the community must first recognise its existence he says there is a feeling that it is shameful for the community to admit there is a problem he says first we have to start a dialogue and second talk honestly without apportioning blame about how we are going to help these women they are stuck between a rock and a hard place they cant go home because of the shame surrounding the failure of a marriage but they are abandoned by their surrogate family here the response of ahmeds family in pakistan is typical they knew the abuse was wrong but said my husbands family were my family now and if i went back to pakistan my children would be taken away from me she says the sense of shame and secrecy surrounding the topic is tangible the stigma is such that shabeen is reluctant to give the name of her organisation if the men knew we gave advice about domestic violence they would stop their women coming here she says she says her organisation has to be wary of bounty hunters women who pretend to be victims of domestic abuse to find the addresses of refuges which they then pass on to families for financial reward the centre will only use a trusted taxi firm as some drivers will happily divulge the whereabouts of runaway wives when rowen questioned vernon coaker the home office minister about the issue he responded that the government was aware of the problem coaker says the government have asked local authorities to be mindful that some victims of domestic violence could have specific needs for care and attention andor have dependent children these factors may make them eligible for assistance under a range of other relevant legislation on a casebycase basis frustration ashiq can barely contain her frustration we are all mindful its hard not to be when these people are knocking at your door she says but because there is no legal obligation these women are just being left there things are starting to progress at a local level islington is the only council to have a specialist nrpf service that gives advice and provides accommodation and financial support in limited circumstances rochdales domestic violence forum will this year consider ringfencing funding for women with no recourse and rowen plans to hold talks with community elders and the council to open up the debate but unless the issue is addressed on a national scale the situation of hundreds of these women will remain the same no recourse no voice no hope,2008-01,one night tasneen ahmeds husband finally went far wa used hitting time didnt stop

men and women who abuse their partners should be identified on a domestic violence register the association of chief police officers said today chief constable brian moore acpos spokesman on domestic violence said dozens of lives could be saved if the perpetrators of domestic violence were tracked in the same way as sex offenders he told mps that while the charity victim support helped more than victims of domestic violence a year research indicated that the true level of abuse amounted to a huge m incidents a year in people were killed in domestic violence attacks including men giving evidence to the commons home affairs committee which is carrying out an inquiry into domestic violence moore said there is no domestic violence abuse register on which perpetrators should be placed i think it should be given considerable extra thought by virtue of the marked correlation between domestic violence and homicide or serious violence those who go from relationship to relationship across boundaries should be subject to amenable and proportionate tracking moore said that without a register sharing between agencies was inadequate each agency may have part of the picture but it is only when all these pieces of information come together from police education social services and from housing authorities that we have the clearest picture of those at risk the law in this regard is inadequate the law on information sharing is passive there is no obligation to share when someone is at risk we have to act now because year on year other people are losing their lives because of this gap in the law moore said the home office was adopting a waitandsee policy and that ministers did not seem to want to change the law i wish i could share their optimism he said there are thousands of protocols about sharing information thousands of protocols must tell you that there is no clear system we are not optimistic that given the number of people who die each year as a result of domestic abuse we can wait for some undefined period after the hearing moore told journalists he believed the number of deaths from domestic violence each year could be halved by adopting better datasharing

a new battle of the sexes dubbed the daddy wars is raging in the home rather than the workplace according to new research an increasing number of men deprived of their role as a breadwinner are competing with their partners over childcare as they try to reassert their lost authority fathers are challenging mothers sphere of influence in the home because they feel it is the one area left in which they can assert themselves exercise their power and define themselves in the home said dr caroline gattrell author of hard labour the sociology of parenthood toby byrne a doctor in hammersmith married to susan a barrister said when our son was born last year i consciously made the decision that being a hugely involved father was a role i could make my own susan found it a bit difficult at

anyway the negotiation of paternal entitlements within marriage will be published next month in the peerreviewed sociological review she found that men develop strategies to secure their position at the centre of the home i saw fathers in dualcareer couples consciously mobilising their socalled paternal rights as a reaction to the shift in the traditional patriarchal culture of power and authority she said they asserted their paternal rights in a way that suggested that children have become the focus for power and negotiation struggles the daddy wars are in full swing in the us where a growing group of men are passionate about why fathers should be as fully involved in raising their children as any mother last months us mens vogue featured a polemic from pulitzer prizewinning journalist charlie leduff about how he had given up the rat race to stay home and raise his daughter in britain however fathers still work the longest hours in europe a year study by the economic and

the making of the modern father said she was exasperated by gattrells conclusions men cant win she said women say they want men to fully share responsibility at home but when that happens they complain what we want is a world where men and women feel just as powerful and in control as each other in both the public and private sphere burgesss report inspired harriet harman the minister for

amid stories of children being glued to tvs and computers there has been plenty of concern about what they are actually looking at but a far more worrying aspect of this is not being fully recognised the dramatic increase in multitasking social networking online flicking their eyes from laptop to tv screen and back again or flipping between channels to keep up with two simultaneous shows at once adults often assume that because they can do something without any obvious harm then its probably acceptable for children to do it too and if children enjoy something modern few parents want to be anachronistic killjoys many adults assume that learning to multitask while youre young prepares todays children for the modern world those adults working in the media thrive on chopping and changing their attention between fastchanging news or trends media multitasking is the modern way of being aware and open to the world around you after all diversity is the concept of the moment lots of variety in experiences is obviously a good thing no its not this naive presumptuous zeitgeist flies in the face of respectable new research and common sense for example studying with a television on makes learning less efficient and makes what a child does learn less useful homework can take longer to complete performing two or more related tasks either at the same time or alternating rapidly between them produces many more errors and it takes far longer often double the time or more to get the jobs done than if you did them one at a time the neuroscientists behind this research are describing the benefits of modern multitasking as a myth the toll in terms of slowdown is extremely large amazingly so you will never ever be able to overcome the inherent limitations in the brain for processing information during multitasking and multitasking activates a different brain region to the one used when you learn one thing at a time which is a significant hindrance to learning even without multitasking a growing number of studies are finding a link between hours of childhood television viewing and later attention damage part of the explanation may lie in the rapid increase in the sheer speed of zooms pans and edits in recent years new screen media are being described by researchers as eliciting conditioning of short attentional span we are living through a disturbing change in concentration an era when the child comes to recognise that concentration is not ones friend but is another word for monotony until their brains are fully formed childrens attention needs protection attention is the prerequisite to what we consider being alive you have to be able to pay attention to things in order to experience them once your attention is damaged then everything that comes from it is compromised learning language reading schoolwork exams job performance relationships and even ones sense of identity can all suffer its like damaging the focus control on the lens that looks out on life in damaging a developing childs attentional system you have damaged the prerequisite to experience their hard drive media multitasking is placing unhealthy demands on our

i am generally not in the habit of reaching for charles dickens when i want to make the case for equality most people would think wed long ago left the crushing injustices of victorian times behind and most people would be right unless that is youre talking about the appalling inequality facing the hundreds of thousands of lowpaid women care workers who look after your ageing mum or dad or the dinner ladies who feed your children or the cleaners who do their level best to keep antiquated hospitals from infecting their own patients if you watched the bbcs bleak house last year youll recognise all the ingredients a longrunning legal dispute menacing lawyers and most important a slow arcane legal system a system that has failed the most important people in all of this the victims of injustice its jarndyce and jarndyce for the st century that is why we yesterday called for a new approach that will deliver some measure of justice for women now hundreds of thousands of those working for local councils have been underpaid for decades the unions blame local government for dragging its heels nowin nofee lawyers accuse the unions of betraying female members in the interest of protecting mens pay local councils highlight the huge cost to the public purse this situation already described as a crisis is in danger of reaching a meltdown in the next few months the number of claims currently clogging up the tribunal system is estimated at around its predicted that this could spiral to a unmanageable this year the equal pay laws were never meant to provide combat weapons for ambitious lawyers its time to cut through the legal and political knots and deliver some results that above all is what the equality and human rights commission is here to do first we want to get these cases out of the gummedup legal system and find a negotiated compromise second where they are being dealt with by the courts we must grease the wheels of justice and clear the incredible backlog and move things through quickly today the court of appeal will hear the potentially precedentsetting case of redcar amp cleveland borough council v bainbridge and others at stake is the vexed question of transitional arrangements this is the extent to which employers can protect mens pay while they try to put their house in order the commission has decided not to provide financial support for the individual claimants in the case but we arent bowing out of proceedings we will send a representative to the court to intervene on our behalf as an independent authority in the case we will offer a solution which we believe will get money into the claimants pockets faster the commission will argue that an employer may lawfully introduce temporary arrangements to protect the pay of existing employees most often men in these circumstances but and its a crucial caveat the employer will have to show that their aim is to eliminate unequal pay as soon as possible and they will disadvantage the women as little as possible its not possible to deliver equal pay in local government overnight the total bill to councils will it is thought come to bn in some circumstances transitional arrangements and we really are talking about finite periods of time here may be a necessary step to stamp out inequality without this the ability of unions and employers to find practical sensible settlements could be limited just as dickens classic is an assault on the british judiciary surely the equal pay crisis exposes the flaws of the antiquated equal pay act it has certainly reached its sellby date if were really serious about a longterm solution we should scrap it in favour of modern legislation to get women a fair deal quickly a key change would be the introduction of representative actions where hundreds of cases could be heard at the same time we believe representative actions could reduce the number of equal pay claims by from to a much more manageable its time to dump the bureaucracy scrap the paperwork and free the lawyers to fight over something else lets move things along today the commission is calling on employers unions and all those who have a stake in this issue to join us for a highlevel summit to debate solutions i hope together we will write a different ending to this story than the benighted residents of bleak house trevor phillips is chair

what price equality its apparently always too high for those who mistakenly believe they have the most to lose one in four norwegian businesses allegedly face the threat of closure because they have failed to ensure that of directors are female abiding by a law passed in business heads have had five years to meet the quota and a great deal of change has resulted in only of directors were female now they make up of directors just short of the target will companies who fail to meet the quota actually be closed unlikely although they may face alternative punishments are quotas a good idea absolutely in the uk of directors of boards are male what does that reflect bad business sense poor understanding of the market anachronistic recruitment procedures and a pathetic fear of the unknown and of course it demonstrates rampant inequality and dont spout all that stuff about this being a middleclass womans thing the young women powering through and crashing their heads up against the glass ceiling are white working class and black and ethnic minorities too and they are more hungry ironically the middleclass women are more likely to give up on their careers when children come as linda grant says the time is not ripe and yet it always is the time is ripe in the uk for equality legislation that has real muscle bring in quotas and class actions in which an individual who wins a case brings improvements for a whole group of employees of whom that individual is representative critics many of them female say that quotas result in the least talented being promoted to positions in which they are ineffectual not only becoming a management liability but also making it more difficult for other women who do have the right attributes to make their own mark a counter argument says that first an allmale board lacks balance and fails to reflect a substantial part of the market that it is trying to reach second talent is rare enough to exclude half the population simply on the grounds that they are alien to your own comfortable culture shows rotten logic third the slow crawl to equality isnt working in the uk and quotas have worked well elsewhere a government can create laws and use incentives and penalties like norway to batter away at traditional conditioning and prejudices in the us in the early s and s for instance quotas and class actions spurred change at least until legislation was overturned by a conservative supreme court in for instance of general motors students of engineering were female seven years later they had risen to in the uk some major companies have changed their policies motivated by maximising profit and reducing the cost of recruitment training and retention they have seen the need for change ibm and hsbc to name a couple in a team of british managers visited new orleans and new york to exchange information on management practice the trip was organised by the internationally recognised ashridge management college now ashridge business school the teams report records the key to success seems to be to learn to manipulate the system to ones advantage within a very narrow band of accepted female behaviour overall a woman has to accept male values systems and cultures if she is to succeed and having accepted these many women then demonstrate little interest in or sympathy with other women rising through the same organisation many women deny that they manage in any way differently from their male colleagues twenty years on in some uk companies in theory at least change is afoot some management is now thinking

the company a very large company and on the board she went to an ordinary comprehensive and did an ordinary degree but someone recognised her ability even though initially she lacked the confidence to see it herself now she is encouraging a working life that is very different for her employees male and female more flexible and less workaholic because thats what she wants for herself a study by the fawcett society published last week says only two of newspaper editors are female one in comment editors is female and there is only one female newspaper deputy editor while in television and radio only of tv and radio editors are female does that matter of course it does feminism was never about women competing in a male world it was about changing the system women need an income and some also need a career thats paramount in their lives just like men but at the same time if capitalism isnt going to thoroughly destroy all that matters feminism has also argued that its important to fight to make the workplace more humane the work ethic less allpervasive the rewards fairer and the personal sacrifices less damaging to children and relationships if morgan stanley who reported a further bn of subprime related losses in december had a board that consisted of women its a strong possibility that it would have been advised not to be so greedy that its a ridiculous idea to expect families

the unlikely new face of radical womens activism in the us meet kiki peppard a yearold switchboard operator and grandmother from pennsylvania who claims she is one of millions of victims of maternal profiling defined as employment discrimination against a woman who has or will have children feminist groups say that maternal profiling has reached epidemic proportions and is getting worse in essence it involves employers building up information on a womans age marital status and family commitments to determine whether to hire her how much to pay her and how much responsibility to give her is she likely to have children and need maternity pay will she want to work shorter hours all these factors push women up against a maternal wall which has been described as the new glass ceiling potentially stopping them from landing a job for which they are specifically even uniquely well qualified peppard has spent the past years campaigning unsuccessfully for a law to ban the practice in pennsylvania she experienced maternal profiling firsthand in when her husband left her and she moved from long island new york to effort pennsylvania the name is appropriate she sighs over the phone she was rejected from job interviews in a row because she was a single mother to james then and carissa then the first question was always are you married the second was do you have children after that they stopped the interview after a year on welfare she finally got a job as a secretary at a high school where they asked no questions about her childcare responsibilities unbelievably then as now it was perfectly legal in states including pennsylvania for interviewers to ask questions about a job applicants marital status family plans and caring responsibilities at the end of the new york times called maternal profiling one of the political buzzwords of the coming year moms rising the increasingly highprofile us campaigning group which promotes mothers rights and has doubled its membership to in the past year has championed peppards case and maternal profiling is edging its way on to the election agenda hillary clinton pledged her interest when campaigning in new hampshire in october last year in the uk asking questions in a job interview about a womans maternal status would leave an employer open to a sex discrimination case yet there is a great deal of evidence that such profiling goes on unspoken and it is a practice that affects not just mothers but all women of childbearing age whether or not you intend to have children the possibility that you might could well be enough to put off a potential employer last year a survey by the new equality and human rights commission headed by trevor phillips found that of recruitment agencies had been asked to avoid hiring women who were pregnant or likely to get pregnant the commission also found that mothers face more discrimination in the workplace than any other group those with children under were less likely to be employed than men with that figure rising to among single mothers a yougov poll of uk directors also conducted in revealed that knew of instances where their company had avoided hiring women of childbearing age admitted to making this decision themselves in the same poll more than twothirds of senior executives said that the bureaucracy surrounding parental leave posed a serious threat to their companies and in an extraordinary survey by hr information provider cromer found that eight in human resources managers would think twice before hiring a newly married woman in her s they had fewer reservations about hiring mothers with older children they said as they would be less likely to take maternity leave all of which reflects the fact that women of childbearing age increasingly seem to be seen as difficult employees so much so that earlier this month alan sugar commented that the laws preventing employers asking women about their family plans and childcare arrangements have resulted in him throwing some candidates cvs in the bin everything has gone too far said sugar we have maternity laws where people are entitled to too much if someone comes into an interview and you think to yourself there is a possibility that this woman might have a child and therefore take time off it is a bit of a psychological negative thought if they are applying for a position which is very important he continued then i should imagine that some employers might think this is a bit risky they would like to ask the question are you planning to get married and to have any children in the last series of the apprentice of course sugar caused heated debate by quizzing candidate katie hopkins on her childcare arrangements during the final interview process in the weeks since sugar made these extraordinary comments cyberspace has been full of mostly anonymous owners of small businesses cheering him on one blogger writes it is high time someone of high profile said what every employer is scared to say i would not employ women the reason i do not employ women is that i run a small business and there is no way that i could fund maternity benefits another replied i know where you are coming from as we too are the same if we do look for a female staff member we would want somebody in her late s or early s and this last comment reflects an observation made by moms rising which estimates that women are only safe from maternal profiling after the age of when they are considered to be past childbearing age as one of the groups activists writes on a maternal profiling blog my life and career path have not made it possible for me to settle down and have children however this does not keep people from discriminating against me by assuming that i either have children or plan to have them soon as if they can hear my biological clock ticking this discriminatory behaviour has always taken place of course but it is hoped that by giving it an emotive name with its connotations of racial profiling and offender profiling the problem might gain new recognition and an organised campaign of opposition as kristin rowefinkbeiner president of moms rising points out sexual harassment is a phrase that helped to spark major legislative and cultural changes widespread use of the phrase maternal profiling can similarly help to spark major changes she describes the incidence of discrimination as jawdropping quoting a recent us study which showed that mothers are less likely to be hired than nonmothers with equal employment experience if youre a mother in america maternal profiling is likely to have happened to you for her part peppard says she has never forgotten the humiliation of having to present her food stamps at the supermarket all those years ago when she was being turned down for job after job her most recent attempt to pass the law stalled before it reached the state senate in november initially i kept up the momentum in the hope that i would get this law passed before my daughter was ready to enter the workforce she says now im doing it for my granddaughter miamibased lawyer michael casey who specialises in employment law says that socalled family responsibility discrimination claims are probably going to constitute the next wave of major litigation directed at employers in the us some us companies are already voluntarily showing support to parents regardless of their state laws because they fear future litigation but there is a knockon effect even to these preemptive moves giving preferential treatment to people who have familial responsibilities has created a backlash involving employees who lack such responsibilities says casey and in future these childless employees could bring reverse discrimination suits over the injustice of always being the ones asked to work late and at weekends lawyers will be happy with that result at least he adds wryly meanwhile in pennsylvania peppard is happy to fight on as long as it takes i have written to oprah winfrey twice a year for the past years and i contacted her again last week i think if she knew about this personally shed call me peppard is dismissive of the mostly male legislature who wont pass her bill i wonder if their own mothers know about what theyre doing to punish women she says maybe they think mothers dont vote and dont matter but we do perhaps she

the government stands accused of failing in its pledges to tackle domestic abuse after it emerged that fewer than half of all men ordered to attend specialist programmes aimed at curbing their violent behaviour complete them it has also been forced to admit that it has yet to implement a highprofile plan to place men who beat their partners under restraint orders despite announcing the scheme more than three years ago opposition politicians were quick to accuse the government of failing to live up to its promises as probation teams across britain highlighted problems with the integrated domestic abuse programme in one case a man from south wales found guilty of choking his wife repeated the offence after more than a year waiting to go on the programme probation officers in the region say they now have more than men waiting for courses a picture their union napo say is reflected across the uk west midlands probation officers say their backlog is now so serious they are placing only the most highrisk abusers on the programmes in avon and somerset waiting lists are between eight and months and in yorkshire some offenders have been waiting for up to two years the programmes run for up to weeks and cost between and each extremely popular with the courts police and the crown prosecution service they were introduced in and widely promoted by the government in as part of its national domestic violence plan but the ministry of justice confirmed that only out of more than handed down by the courts in were completed in the then home secretary david blunkett promised the domestic violence crime and victims bill which introduced specialist domestic violence courts to expand the use of domestic abuse programmes was the biggest shakeup of domestic violence legislation for years and in home office minister vernon coaker pledged that the government would place domestic abuse victims at the heart of the criminal justice system while bringing perpetrators to account for their offences harry fletcher napos assistant directorgeneral said the government has widely flagged dealing with domestic violence as a central plank of its policy there are now disturbingly cases of further offences of domestic violence being perpetrated by men awaiting the course a ministry of justice spokeswoman confirmed that in some areas demand for the domestic abuse programmes was outstripping places but that the government was tackling the problem we are refining the process of assessing offenders to ensure that only those who will benefit from an intensive programme are recommended for it the government has also yet to implement measures introduced in that would allow courts to impose restraint orders against men suspected of beating their partners even if they have not been convicted they were introduced with great fanfare as an urgent measure to better control domestic violence said edward garnier mp the conservatives justice spokesman and a crown court

when i was my grandmother nearing the end of her life and hoping to impart a few last gems of wisdom before she left this world for the next gave me two pieces of advice men who get the milk for free will never buy the cow alas it was far too late for that and i should take a good long look at my thenboyfriend if he wasnt the man for me she said i should bow out of the relationship immediately you wont be a cute young thing forever she said you should select your man and marry him immediately before you start to sag and cant snag a man at all was the unspoken but totally audible extra clause lori gottlieb writing in this months atlantic magazine adds a wouldbe controversial twist on my grandmothers wisdom dont quibble over details just stay with the boyfriend gottlieb would have advised my yearold self settle settle early and easily while youre young and pretty enough to take advantage of such things because waiting for romance means ending up like gottlieb something and taking care of a child if youre lucky you created all on your very own that gottlieb is also a successful author and radio personality is entirely secondary its not the dream at all she says striking a match and reigniting a fight as old as feminism itself it is a story that has the potential to piss off just as many people as that infamous newsweek story that claimed it was more likely for a yearold woman to be killed by a terrorist and that was pre than marry newsweeks article was a frightfest repackaging of the sad spinster debate spiked with a kind of backhanded slap at those nasty feminists who want it all professionally which begged the question whether all yearold women were waiting for marriage it was the sort of thing sex and the city claimed to address and never fully did the question of whether being alone could ever be as happy or as fulfilling as being coupled at least carrie and friends got to have great friends and great sex while they waited for the best man to emerge that television series did a lot to sex up the image of the single woman but even that cast has been whispered about of late with the movie coming out this may commentators have wondered will the women be as sexy as they face and pass shouldnt they have settled down by now gottlieb pushes all the anxieties further any unmarried year old she says who isnt panicked is either in denial or lying every woman i know no matter how successful and ambitious how financially and emotionally secure feels panic occasionally coupled with desperation if she hits and finds herself unmarried gottlieb poopoos the fabulous men the sex and the city gals encountered youre more likely to have sex with a dud sporting a bald pate and halitosis than any adonis once youve left those halcyon s she says i know plenty of women who would disagree about the centrality and answersolving ability of vows lesbians most obviously as well as many other women who dont see heterosexual marriage as the pinnacle of their existence women who believe that they like their male counterparts neednt be pinned by biological imperative to marrying the first eligible inhouse sperm donor they meet it doesnt mean they arent concerned about kids per say and in fact i wrote a piece two years ago for new york magazine about women trying to game the system by freezing their eggs and the us edition of marie claire this month is promoting the exact opposite story baby panic says the cover of the womens mag what to do when theres no mr right inside are three firstperson tales of women who went it alone and survived women of certain means and thats far from everyone are able to buy their way around the biological imperatives that entice women to settle for partners earlier than their male counterparts reminds me of a man i know who has long planned to wait for kids breaking up with girlfriend after girlfriend who wanted them earlier just cause he could and a good friend from college who wants to aim young he always tells me because anyone our age early s would be too focused on having kids gottlieb is rightly concerned by all the women who arent financially comfortable enough to be able to juggle the worklife balance on their own but thats her larger point loneliness is overlooked what it means to share your life with someone should be higher up there but the true nature of partnership is entirely secondary to her advice gottliebs story is peppered with gems like if you rarely see your husband but hes a decent guy who takes out the trash sets up baby gear and provides a second income how much does it matter if hes the one gottlieb sees marriage not as a passionfest but more like a partnership formed to run a very small mundane and often boring nonprofit business but ultimately as funny as she is and the piece is juicy and wry and mean it doesnt address the central paradox to her gospel of settling which is that settling is no guarantee of stability that there is a difference between flexibility and settling just because you settle now doesnt mean you wont divorce later or worry forever that you sold yourself short and thus wind up unhappy gottlieb inherently knows this but tries to push it aside she blithely says divorce would be better than never marrying because then at least theres child support and someone who picks up the kid now and again pretty damn depressing even now when she dates she thinks she could do better should do better and deserves more so she doesnt choose to commit is she wrong no because the entire polemic is misconceived the question isnt really about settling its that weve just created an ideal of perfection that no man or woman could ever fully realise gottliebs own waiting belies this to base a marriage on nothing other than taking out the trash occasionally in the coming years or haggling over chequebooks misses the essential point of partnership marriage just like being single has downsides but those downsides are immensely ameliorated by real attraction sexual and intellectual joy at spending time together and appreciation for each other otherwise you might as well just join a socialist living experiment then someone would be there to care for the kids take out the garbage and pick up the groceries you just wouldnt have to screw them that is unless you really wanted to,2008-02,wa grandmother nearing end life

two books and a select committee report pdf in six weeks maybe its the spring sunshine thats suddenly put the quest for an explanation of the absence of women from the worlds boardrooms not to mention the pay gap back in the shop windows and the sunday supplements there are two positions on this perennial question women dont want to be in the boardroom and men dont want the women to be in the boardroom once almost all men subscribed to and most women subscribed to but now more women are admitting they really have more valuable things to be doing with their lives than charging around trying to be a top executive while in places like norway where legal quotas are now in place far from men conspiring to keep women out there is a desperate search for them to step up as nonexecutive directors maybe the two positions are different sides of the same coin the advance publicity for the sexual paradox by the canadian psychologist susan pinker treads the seemingly wearisomely familiar path of biological hardwiring that is millennia of evolutionary development have put the nurturing urge in women comfortably ahead of the coming first instinct much more than fathers mothers mind leaving their families moreover when left to themselves rather than bossed about by people anxious to break down stereotypes they choose work like medicine or teaching because it appeals in a way that engineering or computing dont even to the most gifted engineer etc etc its not discrimination pinker concludes its our hormones meanwhile in europe former ft journalist alison maitland and avivah wittenbergcox are apparently arguing from the other corner in why women mean business they are adamant that the barrier to womens advancement is not so much selfimposed as draped over us a stifling blanket of cultural difference that they beguilingly brand manonomics the practise of running the working environment in the manner most likely to appeal to the testosteronerich the happy news out of all this is that it seems the two sides are finally if unwittingly approaching common ground there is much much more unstitching of assumptions to be done before either side would recognise it though for example it is fascinating to be reminded as pinker does that many of the really exceptional men the einsteins and the gates missed conventional academic success and useful to ask whether the exam success that girls are now achieving is just not a great predictor of success later in life but it is not quite clear what conclusions to draw from it except maybe that doing well at school is about obeying rules and being diligent not necessarily characteristics of those who succeed later on but dont tell your daughters and certainly dont tell mine where pinker would probably accept that she agrees with maitland and wittenbergcox is that the working environment is too often tailored for a style of worker that is predominantly male just think of all the sexual harassment cases arising from behaviour in city banks plus women tend to have babies in the early to mids just when the process of selecting the future leaders begins men tend to do the choosing and just like selection committees for parliamentary candidates they tend to choose people who look like themselves or at least like the traditional model of the man on the rise women need both sides in this argument we need maitland and wittenbergcox to spell out the persistence of soft barriers and spur the politicians to demand reforms but we need pinker too to put some science into the argument that to meet the demands of the law and get women to the top businesses must examine critically the way their whole culture works,2008-02,two book select committee report pdf six week maybe spring sunshine thats suddenly put quest

culturally specific refuges are lifelines for the many women and children trapped in violent relationships photograph don mcpee honour killings has become a coded reference which instantly demonises

closed off by the governments own policies policies introduced under the supporting people sp housing programme are decommissioning black asian minority ethnic and refugee bamer womens refuges slashing the funds of others and abolishing outreach and advocacy services which are lifelines for the many women and children trapped in violent relationships this is happening against a background of cuts in legal aid reductions in social housing increasing inequality and an acute shortage of services for bamer women facing domestic violence sp officials now frequently ask refuge staff why in this day and age do you need asian womens refuges why dont you merge with generic organisations the answer as refuge workers emphasise is that bamer women choose specialist support for reasons of safety to counter the total isolation from family and community networks and because the generic essentially white womens refuges or other housing associations which local authorities want them to go to do not provide an atmosphere free of racism where deeply traumatised women and children can recover nor do these organisations meet their cultural needs such as the food which is familiar to their children and which their religion permits or counselling in their mother tongue from a counsellor who understands culturally specific domestic violence issues sp and related policies are clearly rooted in new labours adoption of american style neoliberal welfare policies heralding the transformation of a rightsbased funding system into one where a single cashlimited pot is administered by local authorities and controlled by central government this control over funds has little concern for human rights for example under the no recourse to public funds immigration rule women with insecure immigration status who face violence and abuse in the context of marriage domestic work and trafficking are effectively barred from housing or financial support ironically community organisations which serve established community needs are being destroyed in the name of community cohesion at the same time mainstreaming the new buzzword means that specialist areas are being lost and agencies without skilled staff or expertise are being given the impossible task of meeting the very different needs of a large number of diverse groups these are steps backwards which endanger the lives of women and are implicitly racist that is why imkaan is demanding an enquiry into sp policy and campaigning to save bamer service provision and ring fence funding to combat violence against

physical contact is everywhere in cuba as in any tropical country the air feels electric its impossible not to think about your body about sex and sexuality cubans are very flirtatious very intense jealousy is a big issue i first fell properly in love with a girl when i was i was a bit of a delinquent id been thrown out of ballet school in havana for skipping classes i preferred breakdancing on street corners so my father had enrolled me in a boarding school for the performing arts in pinar del ro province i was far away from home and lonely then i met olga she had slanting eyes loved poetry and after i wrote her a poem and gave it to her with a rose taught me how to kiss slowly romantically running my tongue across her lips but she taught me about betrayal too when i caught her kissing a dancer named eduardo i realised that love can be painful and complex as well as beautiful it was a useful early lesson i learned a lot about women as a teenager sexually and mentally that flowers and presents dont mean anything to a woman who doesnt want to be with you any more that being funny is an aphrodisiac in itself that some women like their lovemaking to be wild and adventurous while others are more conservative there are cultural differences of course in cuba its customary to kiss female colleagues on the cheek as a way of saying good morning after i joined the houston ballet as principal dancer in i noticed that many of the girls would do their best to avoid me when they saw me arrive it was all very confusing i grew up with two older sisters so ive always felt comfortable around women i got a lot of unconditional love from my mother whereas my fathers love felt like it was based on whether i made him proud my parents marriage wasnt good they separated soon after i was born but shared the house out of convenience my father a lorry driver slept on mats in our tiny living room so i dont really know what marriage means im a little bit wary of it a bit cautious i proposed to my previous girlfriend american ballerina tiekka schofield on top of the eiffel tower but for various reasons the relationship broke down after four years i had this real sense of failure i had spent four years of my life trying to make it work i didnt even want to think about having another relationship my response was to have a lot of onenight stands im comfortable with the idea that a man and a woman can just have sex and nothing else like many men i find it easy to compartmentalise but now i want to have my own family im living with my current girlfriend but im taking it easy she is very openminded very easygoing shes not fazed when im mentioned in sexiestman polls or reads all this stuff about my female fanbase whatever that means some relationships are all fire i know men and women who argue and beat each other and they thrive on that people tend to grow out of those sort of relationships i know i have though i still dance them sometimes onstage these days i just want a quiet life i spend the whole day creating and dancing so the last thing i want is drama at home i want intimacy and companionship and love isnt that what everyone deserves carlos acosta will be

three brothers a husband and two sons im surrounded by maleness and i couldnt possibly summarise them into a type the only men are from mars thing i do have is when my father would drag me to old trafford every weekend and i would hide under the benches i always remember looking at my brother and my dad and the transformation they underwent their faces would go purple and theyd start chanting and stamping there was something primal about the whole experience i would wonder why they cared so much about what happened to the ball my biological father is an addict and a depressive very kind but very egocentric and very ill my stepfather is much more interested in the greater good than his own hes political he is full of curiosity and was a fantastic figure in my life one gave me my biology and the other gave me my conscience i grew up with my stepfather in brighton but i did spend a lot of time with my natural father and i was loved by both so i suppose the advantage of this was that i wasnt bound by one set of experiences i always had an alternative my husband craniofacial plastic surgeon martin kelly is completely different from both of them very alpha male as a teenager i was always drawn to the confused poet in the corner but hes very positive and upbeat growing up i wasnt allowed dolls and my brothers werent allowed guns i inherited my brothers clothes i was never dressed in pink and they were never dressed in blue there were none of those rules that people still bizarrely subscribe to since spawning two sons i can honestly say im gobsmacked by the similarities between boys and their peer groups boys start to do gun shapes with their hands from the age of months maybe its biological maybe its because one day they will squirt or fire bullets daniel daylewis was my first crush if you wanted to be an actor which i did from a really young age he was the ultimate pinup but my first love was when i was the relationship was all very sophisticated he came down to stay for the weekend and that was that we went out for about two years thank god my first time was with him and not some sordid interlude in the back of the alley im sure your first experience determines which way your rudder points from there on and now im godmother to his son so it all worked out well i first met my husband when i was he was very cool in a band all that kind of thing but he took a long time to grow up our paths crossed again years later and after about two weeks i knew that was it im glad i met him when i did even though i was fairly young because i think sometimes you can crystallise into singledom the only danger for me now would be if i wasnt working and if i was only a wife and didnt have much form of expression out of the house i would find that very difficult im lucky i have a lot of home time and i see work as freedom there is a dh lawrence poem titled wild things in captivity and the last verse is something along the lines of how sex cannot be

government contracts worth bn a year should be withheld from companies that pay women less than the men a crossparty committee of mps declares today it found that years of equal pay legislation have done little to erode the earnings gap fulltime women workers who are clustered into lowerpaid occupations earned less than men last year and parttime female employees earned less than their male counterparts the committee that scrutinises the department for business enterprise and regulatory reform said the worst discrimination was in the private sector it urged the government and public authorities to use the leverage of their bn purchasing power to make companies show active commitment to equality the committee found the greater london authority and olympic delivery authority had equality requirements in their contracts the foreign office required suppliers to provide evidence of diversity policies but some departments appeared to be less concerned about equality the cbi said companies might be asked about diversity policies when tendering for public contracts but this information was usually disregarded it does nothing for this whole issue of diversity if having put in your bid you know the contract has just gone to the lowest bidder harriet harman the equality secretary told the committee that she was considering the reasons why ken livingstone the london mayor could promote equality clauses in contracts this might be because the legislation setting up his office included powers to promote equality the committee said public bodies failing to require suppliers to show an active commitment to equality might be open to legal challenge for the sake of certainty the government could give them a statutory duty by inserting a clause in the proposed equality bill the committees other recommendations included better careers advice in schools to achieve more equality of aspiration among girls and boys and improved adult education to help older women wanting to change occupation judy mallaber labour mp for amber valley who led the inquiry said the gender pay gap persists despite years of equal pay legislation largely due to occupational segregation we need a determined effort on all fronts if we are to crack the worryingly stubborn pay gap and inequality in employment katherine rake director of the fawcett society said progress on pay is glacially slow and it has been a huge disappointment that the government hasnt done enough to speed up change in this area a mori poll commissioned by the society found of women felt the

once upon a time women born in the ss believed that with effort life would be better for their daughters and granddaughters and therefore for their men too instead in the st century the glass is stuck at half empty and there doesnt seem much hope of change as long as society places such a high value on making money while the value of care comes at rock bottom rates new research pdf by kate purcell and peter elias of the university of warwick uses data from a longitudinal study of more than graduates who gained their first degree in they found that young women in their first full time job are already earning less than their male peers three years later its and then by thats one hell of a chasm purcell and elias looked at the factors that might be causing this gap including the sector of the labour market for which women opt hours of work and degree subject studied the most important factor they discovered is whether graduates work in the private or public sector seven years after graduation over half of the females were employed in the public or notforprofit sector but only a third of males in interviews men were more likely to discuss the importance of high financial rewards is that the ghost of the traditional breadwinner speaking or the st centurys very conspicuous male consumer women were more likely to put a high value on socially useful work these responses the two researchers say are eerily reminiscent of findings from studies carried out in the s in the way they reveal womens greater concern with social values human contact and being able to help people are women inherently nicer people i doubt it do centuries of conditioning and genetic makeup play a part obviously is that any reason why women should pay a salary penalty for all their working lives absolutely not local government trade unions have just asked for a oneyear increase in pay of or pence an hour whichever is the greatest gordon brown can bang on about inflation triggers all he likes but such an increase barely delivers a living wage for thousands mainly women who are the working poor and definitely not among those collecting mega salaries for monitoring and measuring yet another round of efficiencies and reorganisations the claim brings the bottom rate of pay in local government to an hour below the considered by poverty experts to provide the minimum living wage well below median earnings of per annum if local government unions accept that will mean a cut in real terms and put local government workers even further behind equivalent employees in the nhs probation police support and higher education and it will widen the pay gap what do women employed to care earn for a care assistant for a residential care assistant for a nursery nurse among graduates a senior social worker with years on the job earns starting salary in the city how do pay increases for in the private sector compare with on offer to local government workers barclays bank received rollsroyce nationwide building society adding yet more substance to the findings of purcell and elias is the glass really half empty men at the very bottom of the pyramid definitely have it tough but todays young women across the classes continue to face discrimination and injustice although many may not have reached the realisation yet that thats the way it is according to new research by shirley dex and others at the institute of education all a young woman has to do to get ahead is to act like a stereotypical male dont have children that you expect to see dont take time out of a career to care

derby day emily davidson throws herself under the kings horse amner at epsom photo arthur barretthulton for a gallery of archive pictures marking the th anniversary of the suffragettes campaign go here a couple of years ago the toilet of venus the rokeby venus was the centrepiece of a national gallery exhibition of many of velzquezs finest works the picture showing the sinuous back view of a naked woman admiring herself in a mirror was almost universally accepted as the embodiment of womanly beauty when it had come on the market in it was bought for the gallery by public subscription for the vast sum of so its savaging by the militant suffragist mary richardson in she slashed it seven times with a meat cleaver was an offence against the public perception of womanhood richardson declared i have tried to destroy the picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest against the government for its role in the destruction of beautiful living women richardsons particular concern was the suffragette leader emmeline pankhurst newly rearrested under the terms of the notorious cat and mouse legislation that allowed women out of prison to recover from the hunger strikes they were using in their campaign to be treated as political prisoners and then rearrested them once they were well richardsons attack on the picture caused more outrage than almost any other act in the suffragettes long and bitter campaign except perhaps the inflammatory combination of what the popular press derided as shrieking women with royalty in emily davidsons suicide under the kings horse in the derby that same year the small courageous band of women who fought for the vote and the thousands who believed as fervently but behaved more decorously need remembering today the th anniversary of the passing of the representation of the people act for it has turned out to be a very rare triumph in the intervening years the moments when women achieved those sunlit uplands so confidently anticipated have been rarer than hens teeth women won the beginnings of justice in but that wasnt what changed britain grit your teeth dear sisters and acknowledge that the universality of voting rights the ending of property restrictions and the granting of the vote to all men of or over was what began the slow transformation of society for in the election in december labour became the second largest party in parliament a position it clung to for another decade until women finally gained equal voting rights then in the election the following year for the first time labour finally won the most seats why the history lesson just look at the fawcett societys list of outstanding inequalities ninety years on they are still campaigning for fair pay and treatment for women at work for an equal voice in decisionmaking for freedom from violence and harassment it was a simple matter of justice that demanded that women had the right to vote the argument about what it was used for divided the suffragettes then and probably delayed their victory and its still unresolved today until the s many women on the left believed gender equality could only be won in the kind of fair society that social democracy could create in the meantime they would fight like men in a mens world for the postwar generation of women in parliament believed the only way to be taken seriously was to deny the gender gap as a result women shared in the prosperity of the second half of the th century and we relished the new social freedoms but we still trailed in a long way behind men the triumph of the secondwave feminists was to render the ostrich position on the gender gap about as fashionable as laceup shoes yet a generation on and change still comes when it comes at all on crutches in the wake of their victory the most passionate of the militant feminists women like sylvia pankhurst or richardson resolved their frustration at the continued male dominance of a

what should we do about the kids families are minicivilisations experience and research show they are the best means of rearing our young into fulfilled adulthood but families are the prisons that can deform individuals for life and whose private arrangements generate fantastic inequality for society beyond parenting offers endless dilemmas navigating your way between throwing a protective mantle around your children and knowing that it is only by withdrawing the mantle that they can achieve the independence necessary to you and them there are also pernicious social consequences from your family choices should you care in conservative times we hear much about the benefits of family too little about the degree family can be bad both for children and for our wider society one of the consequences of tory mp derek conway losing his job for giving his sons our money for doing nothing is that a spotlight has been shone on the dubious practice of mps employing family members and the culture that justifies it in conservative lore nothing should prevent certainly no obligation to society parents being able to give everything to the children they love the tearjerker argument that shadow chancellor george osborne used to justify his proposed lifting of the threshold for inheritance tax to a m conway the boneheaded tory was merely stretching that philosophy to the limits but has found that there are obligations such as accountability and propriety that get in the way it was public money he had been spending the case was open and shut but parallel arguments extend to the private sphere as nigella lawson showed in a widely publicised interview in my weekly she differed from her husband charles saatchi she said about how much of their estimated m fortune they should leave their children echoing american billionaires warren buffett and bill gates she believed that too much inherited money corrupts children they need to work her husband took the premodern dynastic and conservative view that every penny should be passed on with the dna on her website ms lawson subsequently revealed that this shouldnt be understood as a desire to leave her children destitute it is about choosing between leaving nothing and everything a debate about degree that extends well beyond the lawsonsaatchi family in an era of skyhigh house prices how much of the equity in your home should you give to your children to buy theirs how much inheritance should you leave them how much should you be the helicopter parent hovering obsessively over your offspring and fighting for the best across the board plainly you can and must enable your children to prohibit them from accessing what you have and who you are is impossible and would be counter to our deepest instincts but at what point does such enablement become destructive for them and for society a generation ago there would have been very many more who took nigella lawsons view that the bias must be to help children stand on their own two feet now the doctrine is that the family must rule todays parents have become obsessive about their children relentlessly buying them every advantage they can which they cap with the promise of the maximum inheritance it is not just the growth of tutoring and private schools it extends to university dr paul redmond liverpool universitys head of careers and employability

universities now have parent packs as redmond says this hyperactivity beyond a certain age actively harms children employers want rounded selfstarting adults not overgrown children used to their parents constantly bailing them out when called upon the mobile phone is an often disastrous kind of umbilical cord too much parental involvement infantilises children whether driving them a few hundred yards to school when they are teenagers or joining them for interviews with potential employers when they are young adults expectations of future inheritance tends to remove a key spur to selfimprovement and selfcontrol fewer and fewer of the very rich consider bequesting their assets to charity a university or a great cause the volume of giving has remained static over the last decade despite the upsurge in private wealth they would rather spend it on themselves and leave the rest to their children a recent london school of economics report shows that britain has the highest number of family firms managed by children of the founder it is a managerial disaster a potent explanation of our poor productivity few think to challenge the practice or endorse the call for higher inheritance tax to check it part of the explanation is the privatisation of the public sphere the more the realm of the private grows the less accountability and fairness can be expected that old injunction that its not what you know its who you know seems truer than ever the only network you can rely on is family this is reinforced by a mawkish conservatism that celebrates blood tribe and nation we are not a society trying to advance together but a network of concentric blood rings radiating out from family in which case we had better look out for our own jeanpaul sartre wrote that the existential freedom to make and remake ones life could only be achieved by rounded adults and that adulthood required rupturing the bonds with ones parents to reconstruct them later parents setting

i used to cringe when my university peers claimed to be feminists they were usually privately educated annoying brash and had spent a gap year breastfeeding endangered turtles in the galapagos before coming up to a highly privileged educational establishment which qualified them for life as a posh bitch feminism was asserted perhaps as a way playing down a certain amount of privilege in life they may have not been black muslim disabled short obese comprehensive school educated and from the north but by god they were women and hence soldiers in a war against discrimination i of course had the added benefit of a comprehensive school background that added to my cachet i was doubly discriminated against which was a great thing to be in the white rich hallowed halls of cambridge i often wished for a calliper a harelip and ginger hair as well but it was not to be we were and attended an allgirls college new hall in cambridge university it was allgirls because the college was attempting to redress the inequality in an educational establishment that was biased towards men we were given a pep talk by the president of the college when we matriculated the wonderful anne lonsdale we were women of the future or something we had the chance to change the next generation that kind of thing i cant remember the exact words though they were enough to make me feel pretty good that id given up the opportunity to go to manchester and sample the cheapest beer in this splendid land for a concrete building shaped like a breast it went by default and not examination that we were all feminists merely by virtue of finding ourselves in this boobshaped place our maternal mammary in a sea of skinnyjeanclad rah boys whod been educated at st pauls or eton or haberdashers there were what i like to call real feminists in university some did not practise necessary depilation and wore black some looked just like you or me they read gloria steinem and bell hooks simone de beauvoir and irigaray they chose feminism as their cause as opposed to palestine or tibet or zapatistas or whathaveyou when really you couldnt help thinking it could have been any one of these things im not sure what their cause was specifically gender inequality phallocentrism female circumcision abortion rights im sure it was worthy if remote from our unique experience as for the most part white educated middleclass women one of my tutors was a lesbian who wore mansuits and had a posh accent she accused me once of discriminating against feminism why do you see it as ridiculous she asked with a hint of hostility i dunno i said i read that woman rebecca west go on about how ophelia was a real slut and manipulated by all the men around her and it pissed me off i think feminism is about finding things that arent there my tutor bristled slightly and the conversation ended it was only months later that one of my other tutors quietly took me aside and showed me a steaming character dissection that she had written about me and placed on file i was young conservative reductive stubborn arrogant and prejudiced i was the antichrist for feminists my father a rightwing scouser was very proud of me after this and all these years hed been despairing over his liberal leftwing daughter cambridge had shown me where my loyalties lay when i myself did not know or care too much my attitude being that i was a woman thanks suffragettes now ill go and enjoy my life i came to epitomise working as opposed to intellectualised feminism in a sense claiming it as a label because to assert otherwise was a little crass but not really thinking about it too much because the battle was over and what was left to reclaim was remote historical women in literature women in strip clubs or brothels our deprived sisters clad in burqa or genitallymutilated in africa working feminism became distorted by lipstick lesbianism got tangled up with sexual liberation became only a little about the right to vote educational equality nondiscrimination in the workplace it became marred by the numbers of women in the westerneducated world who didnt choose to become doctors and scientists and engineers and lawyers so then we had to find a way to make the stayathome mum a feminist too as well as the page girl and the high class prostitute and the crack addict on the corner we claimed to have earned the right to spawn kids or remain barren and channel maternal energies into our careers we could write about our promiscuous behaviour as evidence of our liberation or declare were sick of men and strap on the chastity belt for the foreseeable future if someone denigrated our choices we could play the gender inequality card because we didnt really have a cause as women we struggled to define one holding up katie price as a shining light of female empowerment one day exposing jordan as a brainless slut the next rebecca west said i myself have never been able to find out what feminism is i only know that people call me a feminist whenever i express sentiments that differentiate me from a doormat or a prostitute i guess what we started trying to do in the st century is make all those choices equally valid so the doormat and the prostitute are asserting their rights as women too to the derision of the purists the lesbian privately educated suitwearing tutors teaching gender theory to cocky little whippersnappers from comprehensive schools who didnt give a shit i started to think of feminism more when what i was doing in life became unconditionally antifeminist i was grinding cock for a living in a strip club getting my tits out cmon theres no way around it i was even more the antichrist for feminists and suddenly i was heralded as a messiah for modern women women it seemed felt oppressed and desexualised and what i was doing was unleashing my sexuality and expressing myself as a female there i was thinking what i was doing was making a quick buck and garnering some interesting stories along the way and all the time i was illustrating that the cause of feminism had actually been about choice all along and if you as a woman wanted to be an objectified commodity you could go and do it ive read the books studied feminisms history seen the glossy pics of mutilated vaginas in marie claire magazine the problem is it just doesnt affect me like most women my age ill tell you im a feminist but really i dont know what that means any more despite the allgirls college despite the paper in gender theorists in my third year despite the lesbian tutor despite the years working in the sex industry despite the fact ive been held up as its paragon or derided as its destructor i dont know what feminism means in britain in the st century aside from finding things that arent there like liberation in a strip club and prejudice against a interpretation of hamlet and so im tempted to say that nowadays it doesnt mean very much at all,2008-03,used cringe university peer claimed feminist

i went to another international womens day celebration last week although this one was a somewhat bittersweet affair the womens resource centre in conjunction with rape crisis england and wales recently published its report into the crisis in rape crisis the launch event was both a celebration of the work of rape crisis centres over the past years and an appeal against the funding catastrophe that has contributed to a reduction in these centres from in to only today while the solicitor general vera baird has been quick to praise the work of the new sexual assault referral centres sarcs and to advocate steps for improving the pitiful rape conviction rates rape crisis centres have been left to languish with no sustainable longterm funding the future of the remaining centres has been continually dependent on a series of ad hoc shortterm grants as the report shows this constant insecurity along with a reduction in the grant monies obtained has led to many of the centres operating with a reduced workforce and unable to provide the full range of services but why do we even need rape crisis centres when weve got sarcs springing up across the country and why do we need specialist womens rape services when sexual offence liaison officer solo units and independent sexual violence advisors isva are there to support victims from the moment they report through to the conclusion of any court process quite simply because the vast majority of sexcrime victims do not report the abuses perpetrated against them either straight away or in many cases ever ninety per cent of women using rape crisis centres do not report rape or sexual assault and therefore dont need the services offered by sarcs and other statutory providers sarcs and isvas deal with victims in the immediate aftermath of an assault whereas rape crisis centres also provide a service to women with historic experiences of sexual violence many of them victims of childhood sexual abuse sixty one per cent of rape crisis clients have been raped or sexually assaulted three or more years prior to accessing their services there are myriad reasons for this reluctance to report some women like constance mccullagh who spoke at the event i attended bury the abuse and get on with their lives only for memories to resurface many years later for other women the stigma of sexual violence and the fear of having to relive the assault in court are too much for them to deal with and for many women the historic and widespread failure of the police to take rape victims seriously and to treat them with dignity and respect means that the criminal justice system is the last place theyll think of going for help while rape myths still abound and while it is still the victims being put on trial for the clothes they wear the amount they drink or for failing to live wholly chaste and innocent lives few women have the confidence to seek the justice they deserve the day after the launch of the report the minister for women harriet harman announced m in emergency funding for rape crisis the following day in the house of commons the minister for equality barbara follett confirmed that this is new money in addition to the m announced two weeks previously by the home secretary jacqui smith to tackle sexual and domestic violence this is a welcome move by the government and helps to allay fears of further rape crisis centre closures this year but it should never have come to this and it still isnt enough essential womens sector organisations such as rape crisis and southall black sisters need longterm sustainable funding while the threat of closure still hangs over many specialist by women for women services and while access to any kind of violenceagainstwomen support service remains a postcode lottery shortterm emergency solutions just wont suffice if the government really is committed to gender equality and an end to endemic discrimination then funding for these services needs to be prioritised its about time its alleged commitment to women had more than empty words behind it and not just when things reach crisis point,2008-03,went another international womens day

the disappearance of womens studies at undergraduate level from british universities to be marked in july by the graduation of the final batch of students from london metropolitan university is symbolic of the changes that have been taking place in the landscape of gender sexuality and feminism during the last decade young women in many universities including my own flow through the doors of academy from across the world in britain the success of girls in education has in itself been a key factor in the expansion of higher education more and more young women expect to gain a degree qualification as a requirement for an interesting and rewarding career which in many ways has replaced marriage and motherhood this in itself when considered as a global trend is the mark of a quite epochal change such that the need for womens studies to understand its consequences might be obvious but alas as this graph of participation rises so does the popularity of womens studies decline opinion is divided among the academic feminist community some point to the vilification of feminism within popular culture as a deterrent if womens studies is only associated in the popular imagination with s radical feminism then it is not surprising it is no longer deemed worthy of study many feminists work hard to counter this view but it is an uphill struggle others point to the way in which womens studies has been mainstreamed it has transmogrified into gender and sexuality studies which when offered as options within humanities social science law business studies and management degrees are among the most popular subjects given the more careeroriented outlook of students today this is not so surprising there are also those who see the passing away of womens studies as a sign that gender equality has been won this postfeminist position is almost always reluctant to acknowledge the energy and massive commitment that was required to make a case for a curriculum which brought gender issues to the forefront across what we might call epistemic communities the feminist academy i inhabit might not have womens studies on offer but it is nevertheless a place of intensity enthusiasm and experimentation i observe a number of patterns that merit further sociological analysis in my undergraduate classroom of up to about students of whom about are female and come from around the world there is a high degree of interest in womens issues including questions of gender and sexuality this is also the case for young british muslim women tackling questions of reconciling faith with the secular values of the university outside the classroom i am frequently asked questions like what can you recommend as reading for our muslim womens study group on prostitution or what did feminists in the s have to say about the family and housework often it seems feminism has become a kind of private passion a way of working through the intractable issues of the day in regard to sexuality and the requirement to fulfil so many normative expectations there is also a genuine interest in feminism from the late s onwards but so denigrated and devalued is the womens movement that it is often hard to dislodge the assumptions that it routinely required hostility to men in fact it is as though the thing young women most fear is being seen as critical of men tired of trying to counter this feminist image i often find myself persuading them that actually most reasonable men had respect for female grievance and found diminishing as they might also do today the endless need to be pleasing to men the aftermath of feminism by angela mcrobbie will be published in july angelamcrobbiegoldacuk,2008-03,disappearance womens study undergraduate level british university marked july

the news of southall black sisters threatened closure has spread like wildfire in the last fortnight the issue has also been raised on cif by sunny hundal founded in sbs shot into national prominence with a campaign against virginity testing the shocking policy of the british government to verify the authenticity of asian marriages by checking the state of womens hymens since then sbs has notched up a number of remarkable firsts the first case of establishing rape in marriage in an asian context of contributing through the celebrated case of kiranjit ahluwalia to the legal redefinition of provocation so that battered women who killed their violent partners could more easily access that defence of winning concessions to an immigration rule which trapped nonbritish women in violent marriages of campaigning against the dangers posed to women by the growth of religious fundamentalism in our communities from the early s long before anyone else was talking about it and developing a feminist critique of multiculturalism while it was still the governments preferred ideology in dealing with its minorities these are just some of the highlights it is appalling that an organisation that has served the most vulnerable section of society must fight for its life when there is no evidence that black women have vacated the position at the bottom of the pile to anyone else the fawcett report powerless poor and passed over confirmed the massive inequalities in health education employment and political representation among other issues faced by black women it is disingenuous of ealing council to justify its decision on the grounds that it wants to provide services to all women in the borough an extremely worthwhile proposition which we fully support if the council was serious about this would it not increase the total amount of money available rather than take away from sbs and ask organisations to provide services for all women for the same amount another organisation will have to include black women in its clientele but without the same track record as sbs it will simply reinvent the wheel in ways that will be dangerous the tories at the council have stolen labours clothes to dress up its cost cutting exercise they have interpreted labours cohesion agenda to mean that single group funding must come to an end because it promotes segregation without recognising that secular groups like sbs actually build bridges across ethnicities religions and cultures we refuse to collude with a strategy which will result in a shoddy service to all women this has left the path wide open to predators ever ready to hoover up the minnows in their path organisations such as refuge with a turnover of million in have bid for the sum of that represented one third of the total income of sbs a sum which probably does not even cover their petty cash we have come to the conclusion that we need to take on these battles not just because the survival of sbs is at stake but because racial gender and class equality are becoming distant dreams on the funding front we also feel that the only way forward is to lobby for donations to build an endowment fund large enough to provide the kind of returns which will eliminate dependence on the vagaries of government funding and divert the huge amount of time wasted on fundraising to our primary function that of

harriet harmans consultation on enabling employers to give preference to ethnic minority or female candidates put me in mind of a couple of my own past experiences i was once the head of a television programme department as a typically white middleclass oxbridgeeducated male i might well have been inclined to recruit others of my kind however more pressing considerations applied like most other highprofile institutions tv companies were desperate to demonstrate their commitment to diversity for the likes of me brownie points were to be acquired by appointing and promoting as many ethnic minority or female candidates as possible hence experience number one i arranged to meet some talented young asians how would they fancy getting into the glamorous world of tv their answer was unexpected the media you must be joking the moneys rubbish we want to be lawyers or accountants experience number two concerned one of my star female programmemakers i was eager to make her a team leader not because she was a woman but because she was the best person for the job she laughed why on earth would she choose hassle long hours arguments and stress she wanted an agreeable and companionable working life and as much time as possible with her children i dont think these experiences are altogether untypical in contemporary britain posh boys dont gravitate into top jobs simply because of discrimination against other groups other factors are more important bangladeshi people in tower hamlets wanting to be industrial chemists or bristol somalis seeking to become firefighters might indeed encounter a measure of discrimination nonetheless the real roots of their exclusion or aversion from these occupations lie elsewhere as for women isnt it time to face up to the blindingly obvious of course theres a glass ceiling but nowadays surely its largely selfimposed in the sexual paradox susan pinker tells the story of elaine who turned down a promotion that would have made her third from the top in a company with employees the firm offered her a networked home office flexihours an inhouse drycleaner and gym an income supplement for a nanny and onsite care for sick children yet what elaine cared about was her family and the promotion would have disrupted it pinker reports research showing that of gifted women turn down promotions for social reasons or take positions with lower pay research in showed that one in three american women with mbas chose not to work fulltime compared with one in male mbas in the face of such realities the only way that employers will be able to construct ethnically and gender balanced workforces is by compromising on substandard candidates willing to accept such offers as those employers able to make should they try to do this however harmans proposal wont help them its designed to protect employers from complaints against discrimination by rejected white males yet this protection would be available only where the successful ethnic minority or female candidate was equally qualified clearly even harman appreciates the problems that would arise if things were otherwise its not just that businesses effectiveness would be impaired

scheme would probably give rise to both of these effects even if they were unjustified doing considerable damage in the process after all the notion that two candidates are ever of exactly equal merit

its centres are the only source of support for the thousands of victims who experience sexual violence in the uk every year however rape crisis is in the middle of its very own crisis due to a severe shortage of funding according to a new survey by the organisation in a country where the conviction rate for rape stands at a woeful as many as half the centres which provide a crucial support service for women with recent and historic experience of rape and sexual assault are facing closure in there were rape crisis centres in england and wales but now there are just that are affiliated members of rape crisis they cover vast geographical areas across england and north wales recent research by the charity end violence against women and the equalities watchdog the equality and human rights commission found that london which has two centres covering london boroughs southwest england wales and west midlands are particularly underserved counties including suffolk and bedfordshire do not have a rape crisis centre at all the main reason for the funding shortage is because until recently there have been no local targets set by central government on sexual violence also decisionmakers and funders have not always been clear about the relationship between sexual violence and domestic violence which does have local targets sexual violence is also a standalone issue and survivors require specialist and tailored support which is different from domestic violence services but local authorities and related partnerships such as crime and disorder reduction partnerships cdrps and local strategic partnerships lsps have tended not to address sexual violence or fund services even when lobbied by local organisations securing funding is a constant struggle for the centres often resulting in low staff morale and the freezing of services until suitable sources can be identified and secured despite sending out numerous applications and often costing salaries well below market value in order to improve their chances of success the survey found that eight centres have still not secured funding for this may also be due to the governments focus in recent years on developing a network of sexual assault referral centres sarcs which are onestop locations where victims of sexual assault can receive medical care counselling and have the opportunity to assist police investigations however rape crisis says that while sarcs play a valuable role in helping women recover they only manage to reach a small group of victims only of rape crisis service users ever report a rape so sarcs are only helping a very small percentage of women says angie conroy policy officer for rape crisis a lot of statutory funding is being diverted to sarcs meanwhile the of victims who dont go to the police are the ones we are working with and struggling to support under current conditions of course there is only so much funding to go around and with many organisations competing for the same pot of grants there are bound to be those who fall short however with the combined annual income of the rape crisis centres that responded to the survey less than half what the government spent on advertising and public relations in it is perhaps understandable that frustration about the situation at rape crisis is growing one area where the picture doesnt look quite so bleak is in scotland which is the only part of the uk where rape crisis centres are actually expanding over the past three years the scottish executive have taken a strategic approach to sexual violence support services and has even ringfenced funding in a rapecrisis pot we would love to see the same model in england and wales that has been implemented in scotland and then we could end this postcode lottery receiving support services after youve been raped is a right not a privilege and at the moment you are lucky if you have a rape crisis centre locally to turn to says conroy even in areas where rape crisis centres do operate there are long waiting lists for services according to the survey the average length of time a victim spent on a waiting list was days meaning that women who are in crisis arent always getting a crisis response so what does the future look like for rape crisis if we continue to lose three centres a year then we wont survive for much longer it is a simple as that says conroy if the funding situation doesnt change more centres will close and thats what we are desperately trying to prevent when we lose a centre we lose staff with years of experience and the only people who are putting sexual violence on the agenda in their area of the country the result is that victims suffer more,2008-03,centre source support thousand victim experience sexual violence uk

they are the shining beacons in the ongoing battle against gender inequality the exemplar employers feted in a government report to be published on monday for introducing femalefriendly policies promoting equal pay flexible working training and development and schemes for women returning to work after having a baby the list includes large organisations such as lloyds tsb and transport for london but also a few small companies and organisations across the uk to prove that the battle is being fought on every front the gender pay gap is rarely out of the headlines almost years after the introduction of the equal pay act successive governments have claimed it is a priority but progress has been slow recent government figures suggested the gap might be narrowing but this week tuc research found the difference between men and womens pay still more than trebles once women reach their s prompting the accusation that bosses enforce a motherhood penalty so whats a government to do more legislation we have been trying to eradicate the pay gap for years its a good illustration of how you can make a law but if you dont provide ways to deal with the underlying problem then you may not be successful says barbara follet parliamentary secretary for equality instead the women and work commission recommended in that the government assemble a team of exemplar employers to act as role models the scheme has attracted both high profile companies and littleknown minnows working creatively to help women often with caring responsibilities at home to push through the glass ceiling of course there are selfserving reasons too getting more women into work is good for business in it was estimated that removing barriers for women at work could be worth between bn and bn to the economy the governments message to laggards is this the only way to stay competitive and keep making profits is to be nicer to your female workers some of the exemplar employers have been selected because they carry out regular equal pay audits using external bodies some draw up individual flexible hours contracts to enable women to work the hours they want and bank extra hours during busy periods a few lay on prematernity leave workshops to allow staff to explore their options and hear the experiences of other working mums and some have introduced a fertility treatment policy that allows employees to take additional leave when going through treatment or supporting a partner at bella di notte a small mailorder lingerie business in north yorkshire women make up of the total workforce and many are mothers with young children a flexible working policy that allows employees to work the hours that best suit them has resulted in a zero staff turnover rate since its introduction consulting firm accenture is proud of its record on maternity returners an increase from to utility giant centrica says it saves m a year since it launched a flexible working policy but does bigging up the best employers constitute a strategy i welcome this report because anything that encourages companies to move in the right direction has to be welcomed but there needs to be a stick along with the carrot says katherine rake director of the fawcett society for example we know the government has been encouraging a voluntary approach to equal pay checks but they dont require businesses to do it so it isnt getting the uptake that it needs this needs to be made mandatory in february a crossparty committee of mps that scrutinises the department for business enterprise and regulatory reform recommended that government and public sector bodies use their purchasing power and restrict the award of contracts worth bn a year to companies that show an active commitment to equality tougher measures on inequality could prove to be a vote winner at the next election according to a recent fawcett society poll in which of women said the government should do more to tackle the pay gap and more than half said they would be more likely to vote for politicians committed to ensuring equal pay follet admits that introducing mandatory equal pay audits is a measure the government have considered but would prefer not to introduce as it increases the burden on business the governments report is only the latest in a long line of guides to good employers from great place to work to

a stayathome dad looks after his child photograph david sillitoe david cameron announced today that the tories are planning to offerparents more flexibility on maternity and paternity leave meaning that they could take time off together rather than be restricted to having to choose who works and who stays home the party says that this would help fathers become more involved in caring for their children in sweden stayathome dads are a common sight since they can take up to seven months paternal leave and it appears swedish women have come a bit further in the debate for them its not a question about who does the chores but how they are done when the man is in charge of family logistics says jenny sundelin many fathers do the cooking the dishes the laundry and the shopping as well as going to regular daddybaby groups the scandinavian outlook is that gender equality should be a basic right both in the home and at work a swedish author gunilla bergensten has recently published a book about this called the resignation of a family project manager swedish the critics call it an angry but liberating humorous book about gender role division in the home on the other hand fathers in the uk have more often been in the shadows men arent part of the picture as much as they should be the media usually highlights the issue from a womans perspective consequently pushing the male standpoint further to the sidelines still there has been plenty of coverage of the likes of fathers justice while other networks such as the fatherhood institute also aim to highlight fathers issues last october the fatherhood institute published a study called the cost and benefits of active fatherhood the report says that fathers of twoparent families where both parents work fulltime only carry out an average of of childcarerelated activities during the week and onethird at weekends however the pattern has been changing the study says that between the time new fathers in the uk worked flexible hours to spend time with their child rose from to more importantly the same study says that up to of british men would like to spend more time with their family equally the national centre for social research in the uk natcen has found that views on gender equality have changed only of men think its a mans job to earn money according to a report from january of this year however the survey also states that british behaviour has not changed as much as its attitude up to of couples said that when it comes to laundry it is still the woman who sorts the socks,2008-03,stayathome dad

imagine being trapped in your own house physically mentally and sexually abused frequently told you were going to be killed and then on one occasion actually doused with petrol and threatened to be burnt alive and throughout all of this knowing the state cannot offer you any protection or support it sounds like the storyline of a film but sadly this is not fiction and this is not some faroff country this is a reallife story from the united kingdom and is included in a report no recourse no safety pdf published by amnesty international uk and southall black sisters today it is just one example from hundreds of cases that affect the most vulnerable women in our society each year a vast majority of whom are unable to escape to refuge the problem centres around a piece of legislation called the no recourse to public funds requirement refugees often need housing benefit to cover accommodation costs and income support to cover basic subsistence while women recover this requirement forbids these vulnerable women from getting either the rule was designed to stop certain people taking advantage of our benefit system but instead it affects thousands of people who are here legally people have gap years study abroad travel and work abroad visit abroad and get married abroad these are the women we are talking about here ordinary people doing ordinary things sadly their experience of the uk has become a violent nightmare the only choice they have is to rely on the generosity of others become homeless or remain stuck in a cycle of violence amnesty international believes that that choice simply is not good enough any woman whatever her status who is being abused severely beaten or sexually assaulted needs to have an option to escape it is disgraceful that in this day and age the uk government can allow this to happen on our doorsteps the uk government needs to set up appropriate structures to guarantee accommodation and support to these women it is no more than the us canada denmark and austria all countries with similar immigration concerns have already done and in each of these countries there has been no evidence of an increase in bogus claimants the no recourse to public funds requirement is also proving deeply frustrating for the british police they often have the responsibility for looking after them and they are having to rely on a shrinking pool of

a lot of insecure men find funny women very threatening because a sense of humour implies intelligence and sometimes aggression when i was growing up in wolverhampton if i could come up with a funnier joke than a boy it emasculated him on the spot when i first started writing i was reminded of one of arabella weirs characters in the fast show she comes up with an idea but the men in the room ignore it until one of them repeats it only a few years ago producing and directing were jobs for the boys but now there are a lot more women on all levels although men have changed in the workplace too in this business lots are married to strong creative women they have learned from personal experience men dont want a doormat they want an equal i met my husband sanjeev bhaskar on goodness gracious me in but i saw him first on stage he really stood out because he was so surreal and intelligent i remember feeling quite envious i thought he was good but then i thought he was a little too good he was better than me we knew each other for six years before getting together it was a natural progression from being friends people ask if there was a definite moment but there wasnt really it was about timing i would say that being friends first is the only way to have a great relationship when everything else has got wrinkly and dropped off you still have what attracted you in the first place which is the person who makes you laugh you can talk to and confide in i was married before and i dont regret it we are good friends i only have two exes and i married one of them i was a really late starter im almost embarrassed to say that i was when i met my first boyfriend my dad made it clear that boys were not on the agenda until well after school i was a sheltered girl when i left home at university i was a slightly bolshie feminist i wore what my husband fondly calls my feminazi war look of leggings doc martens and long jumpers it was the vogue to not like men i had friends who turned gay on principle though very rapidly after leaving they hooked up with men and had babies but at university men were bastards that was a home for a while and then i realised i was cutting off half my community i was not going to solve anything by being separatist it lasted as long as university but i will have that political awareness all my life of course i tempered it with experience especially when i ended up sleeping with the enemy when the bahji on the beach film came out it was quite radical for its time dealing with domestic abuse it was perceived by some of the more conservative male members of the community as washing dirty linen in public older men picketed the cinemas but to be honest i think those elements have really died down there is a lot more acknowledgement and acceptance about what we can talk about certainly old men dont throw tomatoes at me in tesco any more i like the way that men on the whole if they have an issue with each other just say it they shout and punch a wall but five minutes later it is forgotten i dont like psychological vindictive tactics which women are really good at why cant they just have a punch up and forget it i have to admit to an innate prudish admiration for mens ability to fix things i do get a really big thrill whenever i see a man putting something up it is almost magical to me,2008-03,lot insecure men find funny woman

photograph spencer plattgetty hellen odwor chats and laughs with friends as her children play nearby women in the ogur and omoro subcounties in the lira district of northern uganda have a lot more to smile about nowadays and there is a strong sense of community that ladies in the community have rarely experienced actionaid has been working there to increase access to justice for victims of violence our plan was to initiate awarenessraising activities engage with sections of the community to overcome the obstacles to access to justice and improve womens rights overall odwor a yearold mother of eight was beaten regularly by her businessman husband but she never spoke of her troubled home life with women in the neighbourhood even though the bruises were there to be seen she was also aware that she was not the only one suffering at the hands of violent husbands or families my husband would get quite violent with me if he was ever angry or if he didnt have a good day at the market she says i would get very upset but there was no option to leave him or to explain that he was hurting me women from my neighbourhood knew what was going on but it was so regular that it was kind of accepted another woman we have encountered is helen apio who says my husband was suspicious of a yearold boy who i had sent to buy charcoal my husband asked to know why the boy had given me money i explained the circumstances to him but he did not believe it i saw him entering the hut and the next thing was a cut on my mouth and head i do not know what happened to me after that it was against this backdrop that in january we launched our three month programme focusing on violence against women empowering them by providing information on access to justice after gathering baseline statistics we began discussion groups for the community to assess what factors they thought hindered womens access to justice a radio listeners club for the women was set up providing information on where to go for help on issues ranging from land rights to sexual violence two hundred radios were distributed in the area so that women could listen to the show together we also engaged with the police force equipping them with training manuals and sexual assault collection kits to help when women came to them with claims of abuse six police kiosks were constructed designed to give women a private area in which to talk and report cases of violence we faced a few challenges along the way though the number of women who showed interest in the project was quite high and the radios we had initially budgeted for were insufficient which is why we doubled it to evidence collection kits needed to be sent from south africa and that caused unnecessary delays but overall we felt the programme had been a success there may be no hard evidence to support a reduction or increase in the number of incidents but this is mainly because women hadnt reported incidents before so there were no figures to compare it to but in the three months after the programme there was a dramatic increase in the number of cases reported to the police from cases to this indicates that more women were not only accessing services but using them also the work also helped bring communities together apio was one of the many women who has seen results from the program quicker than others she said my husband cut me on the neck with a machete but when i was in hospital i wrote to the police and ordered them to release him because i needed someone to look after me before he was released however he was cautioned and we underwent counselling together this would never have happened before the programme apios estranged husband is currently on remand at erute government prison hellen odwor adds it is very different here now my husband doesnt raise his hand to me anymore and instead we talk about our problems amrefs ultimate objective is to empower communities to hold their governments to account to deliver the services that are rightly theirs gender empowerment is a key part of that rightsbased approach but what else can be done to improve the lives of women in uganda is anyone involved in work that aims to educate people from an early age to help prevent violence against women happening to what extent is alcohol the problem,2008-03,photograph spencer plattgetty hellen odwor chat laugh friend child play nearby

mothers who separate from their partners are recovering faster from the collapse in income that many women experience after a marital split research reveals today the institute for social and economic research at essex university found the financial effects of separation used to be catastrophic for mothers and children between and the average decline in a mothers income was after splitting from a partner comparing spending power in the years before and after the breakup but between and the figure was the researchers measured the income of the mothers household after adjusting for the number of adults and children living in it prof stephen jenkins the institutes director and the studys author said separating mothers and their children are still experiencing far worse financial circumstances than their departing partners between and the separating fathers enjoyed a rise in net income in the year after the split between and this declined slightly to but the mothers are recovering faster from financial meltdown as they are more likely to get a job and are more likely to qualify for support from the state to make the job worth doing separating mothers were helped by rising rates of employment for women during the s and early s said jenkins these were given a particular stimulus by the introduction of the working families tax credit in which both increased the incentives for those in workless families to find a job and helped to make work pay the study based on annual interviews with households found most women with children never totally recovered from the financial effects of the split five years on their incomes were on average still below presplit levels those who had a job in the year after the split and kept it for the next five years came close to restoring their income to presplit levels those who did not have a job and did not find a new partner remained much worse off jenkins said the mothers financial recovery might be regarded as good news but added there remain large gaps on average between the shortterm income losses of separating husbands and of separating women this is despite the improvement in the circumstances of women with children the average shortterm income loss for childless separating women has remained fairly constant over the last years gender remains a good predictor of whether an adults income rises or falls after experiencing a marital split dr paul dornan the head of policy and research for the child poverty action group said some have argued the tax credit system somehow incentivises parents to live apart

it strikes me after reading about the survey of womens working patterns before and after childbirth the baby blues study finds a third of mothers slip down the career ladder february that none of the writers has addressed a key problem the attitudes of many women themselves i am the mother of a fourmonthold baby and a professional researcher i am going back to fulltime work in a month with my son going to nursery onsite i have encountered shock from women of all ages they generally assume i am only going back parttime and ask why i want to return fulltime i can go through several reasons such as i want to i love my job i like being financially independent but the only one that washes is when i say im the breadwinner my choice is only accepted when its perceived to be a nochoice situation until these entrenched social attitudes are changed women will be forced off the career ladder without any help from government or men dr jane mooretaylor chesham buckinghamshire until the age of i enjoyed in many ways sexual and economic equality with men i had my own house a decent job and a fairly autonomous life by i was broody desperate even to have a baby and acquired four males a son husband and twins in that order keeping my brain cells intact and a foothold in the outside world has proved very tricky i have been plunged into social and psychological conditions of mothering that are actually worse than my mother encountered in the s social mobility has meant no grandparents to call on and no extended family networks for support lack of funding for nannies the tyranny of the pm school gate and the isolation of the modern nuclear family means that in this socalled postfeminist era i have little more choice than my own mother my marriage my sense of self and my career have all had to take place in the narrow margins that motherhood permit bev gold cambridge rosie boycott the world is still organised to meet the wishes of men february is right to remind us that universal childcare is key to closing the gender gap but shes painting a toobleak picture daycare trust the national campaign for universal childcare believes that this government has done a lot with free early

day staring at a computer screen this afternoon i took my kids to a coffee shop for a chat after school sorted out a fight over toys and helped my son prepare for a test i also heard my sevenyearold tell her first dirty joke i could find more challenging work but i know that the hours would be longer and the stress would be greater and then when the kids fight i might not keep my cool there seems

the most shocking aspect of this weeks figures showing how far women slip down the career ladder after having a baby is that they come as a shock to anybody since any parent realises immediately after the birth of their first child that they have just taken part in a job creation exercise that will provide fulltime work for at least the next years it is still astonishing that children are completely ignored in career planning and this is at a time when we are all too eager for these same children to become career minded as early as possible with increasing emphasis on links between education and work after the recent work week in my fouryearolds reception class in which parents put themselves up for probing questions about their careers such as do you have a cat in the office my daughter announced that she wanted to be two things when she grows up on tuesdays and wednesdays she would be a doctor the rest of the week she would be a cowgirl i so admired her early desire for worklife balance that i felt i couldnt really sit her down and go into the practical difficulties of flexible working but maybe i should have done because i wish someone had done it to me at my girls secondary school highflying doctors designers or engineers would come in from time to time to give talks i remember being particularly inspired by an international lawyer who talked about lots of foreign travel status intellectual stimulation and general glamour she didnt once mention what happened if the nanny was off sick good feminists that we then were we probably wouldnt have listened anyway why on earth should womens career ambitions and decisions be made on any basis different from mens well i now have two very good reasons why the fouryearold has an older sister and i am still confused about why when they feature so centrally in my career decisions now they were never taken into consideration when it came to careers advice in january ed balls was telling schools to offer impartial careers guidance to pupils rather than promoting hairdressing courses to girls and construction apprenticeships to boys he wanted more young women being encouraged and supported to have a career in engineering and more young men being encouraged to have a career in childcare he said of course girls have just as much right to information about engineering courses as boys and of course you shouldnt make assumptions about their future life plans nearly a fifth of women never have children after all but that still leaves the vast majority who do and the vast majority of men too and yet this fact has somehow become unmentionable often right up until a new mum returns to work and has to scrabble around with personnel officers trying to cobble together a parttime career until school hours mean she has to give up altogether encouraging young women to aspire to be engineers is admirable and important but it is also only fair to address the fact that project managing a north sea oilrig is tricky with toddlers and that goes for fathers of young children too i can see why it might stick in the craw of businesses or professions when recruiting to think that their future employees may occasionally have other things on their minds than devotion to their employers but they are deluded equally deluded are those who think worklife balance means a few beanbags scattered around the office in my experience most women and many men do at some point make career decisions based on their domestic circumstances wouldnt it be a lot easier for everyone nonparents included if their workplace acknowledged this then women and men could openly plan careers that recognised that they might want to see their kids occasionally and advice on childcare options could become as important a part of a personnel officers job as advice on the pension package until then ill be advising the fouryearold to be a cowgirl full time and that could mean we all miss out on a particularly

woman is a biological distinction femininity is that group of personality traits women are traditionally expected to exhibit feminism is a movement which challenges these gender stereotypes and combats discrimination against women if youre a man obviously you cannot be a woman at least not without major and quite painful surgical intervention as a man you can be feminine or like most people exhibit a mix of feminine and masculine characteristics likewise progressive men should be allowed to regard themselves as feminists despite my aversion to the limiting effects of labels i would certainly define my views on gender issues as being feminist cath elliotts article last week highlighted the controversy about whether men can be classed as feminists although she expressed her personal indifference to labels some activists both women and men are not so accommodating in fact some claim that men cannot be regarded as feminists a view which strikes me as paradoxical since feminism strives to end sexism yet this exclusion strikes me as sexist the main rationale seems to revolve around the notion that only women can truly understand the female plight and truly know what it is like to face gender discrimination but humans are equipped with a remarkable imagination and sense of empathy if they choose to exercise it history is replete with examples of outsiders who become the iconic embodiment of certain struggles such as the privileged young doctor turned poor mans revolutionary after all you dont need to be working class to be a socialist nor a member of a minority to appreciate the suffering caused by racism people didnt need to be black to struggle against apartheid nor spanish to fight francos totalitarianism besides if the lack of direct experience disqualifies one from being a full member of the cause should we bar western feminists from showing solidarity with their sisters in less enlightened societies because they have not experienced the same magnitude of discrimination in their relatively egalitarian corner of the world moreover men do have direct experience of sexism and a major stake in combating it first of all there are the women in their lives if your wife girlfriend mother or sister experiences gender discrimination it also has an impact on you because it makes you angry and frustrated on her behalf moreover men who discriminate against women are not acting in the name of the rest of their gender and the best way to express that would be to describe ourselves as feminists in addition the macho culture which sidelines women can also belittle and ridicule the men who question it and so fighting shoulder to shoulder for the cause of gender equality is as much a progressive mans prerogative as it is a womans under the banner of feminism as elliott rightly points out centuries of patriarchal hegemony has harmed men too amusingly one post in the debate under the article asked if men can be feminists can women be male chauvinists i believe they most certainly can some of the loudest advocates of the patriarchal order both in the past and today have been women and this highlights perfectly the fact that just because you have a vagina it does not automatically make you more sympathetic to the cause there seems to be a fear that men would try to dominate the movement elliott says that i really dont need men telling me how to be a better feminist or that my kind of feminism is wrong i find such a description of lets call it male feminist pigs rather unflattering relating obnoxiousness and bossiness to gender in this way is quite frankly rather sexist after all men do not have a monopoly on being domineering or is elliott suggesting shes never come across obnoxious female feminists would elliott appreciate a woman feminist lecturing her on how to become a better feminist or trying to dictate to her the terms on which she should act as a feminist elliott stresses that you cant call yourself a feminist and then go home and beat your partner and in the next breath deny your daughter the right to decide her own future i agree in fact that is precisely where i would regard myself as a fullyfledged feminist i dont go to rallies nor shout slogans from the rooftops but i strive to apply the principles of equality in everything i do to my mind feminism is about gender equality and the freedom of choice to enable girls to be boys and boys to be girls and girls to be girls and boys to be boys and all the shades in between,2008-04,woman biological distinction

the publics blase acceptance of alan sugars just dont employ them attitude to women of childbearing age shows you can take employers to the hr fountain but you cant easily change the way they think equality in the workplace is a founding tenant of eu law and laws in britain already forbid sugar from grilling a woman about her childcare arrangements as he did on national tv so if legislation isnt fully working how can the pathways to fulfilling and powerful careers be made easier for women is it even possible and is it worth fighting for well in an aberration to her feminist roots as editor of womens rights magazine spare rib rosie boycott thinks not in a book review last week she said that women and mens brains are wired differently and most of us women simply dont want that toplevel career kind of success i presume she was not including herself in this most of us as she spent most of her childbearing years racing to become editor of the independent and daily express but far from liberating women from the stresses and strains of reaching out for recognition in the daily news meeting boardroom or political chamber fatalist reductions of gender roles in the workplace such as boycotts only serve to let sexist and unsupportive bosses off the hook what better reason than to deny a childless woman in her thirties a job opportunity or an ambitious young mother a promotion or training than the old adage that maybe they would better satisfied setting their career sights lower to free them up to find more inherent meaning in childrearing such a statement appears historic but frighteningly this set of beliefs is becoming increasingly mainstream just last week it was spoken by boycott a women who previously fought for womens equality in the workplace and advocated by the popcultures favourite business brain sugar who shockingly is also a government advisor on such issues it makes sound and absolute economic and democratic sense for boards businesses and parliaments to reflect the demographics of their population how can a marketing firm manufacturer or political party target of its audience if their board and workforce represents just of that demographic whatever skills people have typecast women with better at multitasking more even headed and better communicators one certain thing is that at school girls are outperforming their male counterparts in historic proportions on average more girls than boys achieve five cgrade gcse passes each year but three years after graduating female graduates still earn on average less than their male counterparts in a country that appears to have legislated against such inequality and has a strong feminist tradition how has this happened and how has it come to be that the uk has the largest gender pay gap in the european union an antifeminist media and public feminist malaise could be said to blame todays uk teenager or young twentysomething isnt burning her bra or i doubt even aware of what that stood for surveys have shown that of to yearold girls consider being a glamour model their ideal profession and in a separate survey of women wags coleen mcloughlin and victoria beckham not jacqui smith or even jk rowling were voted the most admirable women this month the womens committee is putting forward a paper in the european parliament on how marketing and advertising affect equality between women and men i am pushing forward an amendment which will include extreme concern about the reinforcing of stereotypes of women as objects in publications that are readily visible and available to children but pushing nuts and loaded onto the top shelves and banning page wont solve the already endemic problem of low female aspiration and acceptance of misogynist diatribes that seek to exclude women from the boardroom and leave them ensconced in the bedroom what it takes is for women who are ambitious women who have achieved women who seek to make their mark to spread the word and pull other women up with them women talk to your coworkers friends daughters sisters and nieces about ambition about the satisfaction of running a project writing a groundbreaking report and leading others dont get to the top and denounce is it as unworthy as boycott has done this is the capitalist world as built up mainly by men but we women have to get involved in it in order to make the differences needed and wanted by

in the book feminism is for everybody bell hooks defines feminism as a movement to end sexism sexist exploitation and oppression while the oxford english dictionary defines it as the advocacy of womens rights on the grounds of sexual equality youll get no argument from me on either of these interpretations theyre straightforward noncontroversial and best of all inclusive ignore all the confusing subdivisions like marxist feminism radical feminism and anarchafeminism and the arguments about whether were experiencing the thirdwave or whether were in a state of post feminism and feminism really can be summed up this concisely whats even more exciting is that if we went by either one of these definitions wed probably be hard pushed to find someone who wasnt prepared to declare themselves a feminist but is it really as straightforward as this can everyone who supports the idea of womens rights call themselves a feminist or are there other criteria that have to be met before people are allowed to sport the label like having a vagina for example or having experience of life as a female and all the attendant discriminations that that brings can men ever really be feminists or should profeminist men be consigned to the sidelines welcome allies in the struggle for gender equality but disqualified from full membership by dint of their unasked for but nonetheless privileged position as fully paid up members of the male fraternity any movement for social justice would be doing itself no favours if it deliberately excluded its own supporters from the ranks but while many feminists welcome mens championship of the cause theres still a great deal of debate over their entitlement to call themselves feminists the argument rages even amongst profeminist men with some arguing that gender should be no barrier to full and active participation and others arguing that as feminism is rooted in the womens liberation movement a movement founded by women for the advancement of women men have no right to lay claim to the tag brian klocke of the national organisation for men against sexism has argued although i believe that men can be profeminist and antisexist i do not believe we can be feminists in the strictest sense of the word in todays society men in this patriarchal system cannot remove themselves from their power and privilege in relation to women to be a feminist one must be a member of the targeted group ie a woman not only as a matter of classification but as having ones directlylived experience inform ones theory and praxis women feminists have also voiced misgivings about mens involvement in the movement some men they argue automatically assume a dominant role when they become activists claiming to be better feminists than feminist women and failing to recognise and challenge their own sexist behaviour these socalled fellow travellers merely reinforce the tired gender stereotyping that feminism seeks to subvert and by their domineering behaviour they silence womens voices and perpetuate existing male power and oppression they jockey for control and appoint themselves as spokespeople in a diverse nonhierarchical movement that neither needs nor seeks figureheads or leaders personally i have some sympathy with this position having had my own runins with socalled male feminists to be perfectly frank i really dont need men telling me how to be a better feminist or that my kind of feminism is wrong by all means debate the issues with me but define my feminism for me no i dont think so these annoying entryists aside men are welcome allies in the struggle for womens equality the current crisis in masculinity and the search for a male identity bear testimony to how centuries of patriarchal hegemony has harmed men too profeminist men have been active in challenging male behaviour and attitudes founding organisations like the white ribbon campaign which raises awareness of male violence against women and working with young men pdf in schools as both role models and mentors at the end of the day any men prepared to stand up against sexism sexual and domestic violence socially constructed gender roles and womens oppression are all right by me i dont care what they call themselves either allies fellow travellers feminist sympathisers profeminists or even just plain feminists it doesnt matter whats on the label its how feminism is translated into everyday life that matters you cant call yourself a feminist and then go home and beat your partner you cant call yourself a feminist and in the next breath deny your daughter the right to decide her own future you cant call yourself a feminist while at the same time youre patting women on the head and telling them how to think but treat us as

more than half of bosses consider the chances of a new recruit falling pregnant before employing them research showed today more than threequarters of employers said they would not take on a woman if they knew she was going to become pregnant within six months of starting a job and said they would feel cheated if a new recruit announced within weeks that she was expecting a child the research by the employment law advisory services elas was carried out after the firm found an increase in the number of cases it was handling involving pregnancy and new employees these included cases where candidates were asked in interview if they had plans for a family a practice banned under sex discrimination law and where job offers were withdrawn between the time of the interview and a candidate taking up a post because of pregnancy elass survey of company bosses and personnel managers found admitted that during the recruitment process they weighed up the chances of candidates getting pregnant taking into account their age and if they had recently got married almost seven in said they would like to be able to ask people about their plans to start a family during the interview process and only said they had recruited someone in the past who they knew was pregnant peter mooney head of consultancy at elas said despite legislation to outlaw discrimination companies were still shying away from recruiting pregnant women for many bosses it is down to the bottom line a pregnant member of staff will cost money however a visit to a tribunal can be even more costly he said the fact that almost eight in of those we surveyed would not employ someone if they knew they were going to fall pregnant within six months shows that discrimination is bound to happen if it is obvious a candidate is expecting a baby mooney said employers should bear in mind that the best candidate would still be the best even if they had to take time off on maternity leave he added there is always a chance that a male employee could be off because of illness so it is best to base decisions on other things rather than the threat of maternity leave since last april new mothers have been entitled to weeks of maternity leave of which are paid to qualify for leave motherstobe must tell the employer at least weeks before the baby is due during pregnancy and maternity leave it is unlawful for

cashpoint and are greeted by sirens flashing red lights and a depressing clunk as the machine contemptuously spits your card back at you without any of the money you asked it for with your partners maternity pay drying up you need to get used to living on one salary and that isnt always easy when people get a pay cut which is what living on one salary effectively is they are incredibly bad at

steps can you take to soften the blow plan ahead time can fly by in the months before a baby arrives but nicholas haseman a financial adviser with prominent financial services in hounslow says you should start saving as soon as possible one of my clients knew she was going to take time off to have a baby and somehow she managed to save up an entire years salary in advance haseman says thats an extreme example but she wasnt in a particularly wellpaid job and it shows that with a bit of determination you can do it make a budget i would urge anybody to do a proper genuine budget says lewis if it shows youre spending more than you earn you need to look at what you cant do any more lewis suggests a technique he calls piggy bank budgeting to help plan for the big outlays the day your money goes into your bank account immediately siphon it off into a number of other accounts for example a bills account a holidays account a clothing account and a christmas account that way when the time comes you wont be caught out claim childcare vouchers if you have kids in childcare find out if your employer operates a childcare voucher scheme normally when you get paid for every you earn as a basic rate taxpayer youll get after tax and insurance with this scheme you can convert of your salary into vouchers to spend on childcare be tax efficient investigate whether you are eligible for working tax or child tax credits and if you are married check you are not paying tax unnecessarily on your savings transfer any joint savings or investments into your spouses name while he or she is not working as they will usually be liable to pay less income tax than you says haseman you could also consider registering the nonworking partner as a non taxpayer cut your spending from taking your

mike and albertine davies with their children alex aged one and linus three mike and albertine davies both work part time so they can share responsibility for looking after their sons linus and alex here they outline the pros and cons of their choice its the beginning of the summer term and next years school timetables will soon start to take shape for us that means lots of head scratching about how we can make shared childcare work for another year as a teacher and a probation officer we are incredibly lucky in that the teachers hours are fairly family friendly and probation hours can be pretty much worked around them we also have an obliging grandmother to our boys for the last couple of years she has provided one days childcare a fortnight which makes the whole thing viable although the dual parttime routine had been the great childcare plan for as long as we can remember we had no faith that things were going to work until suddenly it was all arranged to complicate things the school runs a fortnightly timetable which leads to some funny hours for both of us but it seems to work another downside is money although if you are considering giving up work altogether and living on one salary our way is a slightly better financial option two halfsalaries add up to slightly more than one whole one once you add in taxation career progression or lack of is also a problem parttime status should not by law be a barrier to advancement that would be discrimination but there are some jobs where it is not viable to be part time more legitimately it takes you twice as long to notch up the necessary experience for promotion we may also be imagining things but it seems harder for a parttime man to be taken seriously in his career than a woman people are used to women looking after babies but are often surprised if a man wants to do it thats the bad news and it is outweighed by the good spending half our time with the children helps to keep job stress in perspective and just as were beginning to get weary of the highcriticism lowthanks atmosphere of home we get to go back to work where people ask for things nicely and no one weeps if you cut their toast into the wrong shape the boys are lovely but work can seem easy by comparison the other really big upside of sharing childcare is that the other person knows really really knows exactly what its like we both know how tiring it is and how joyful it can be we both have good bonds with the children since we spend a lot of time with them and it has also had a positive effect on our own relationship since it feels very equal to be dividing both types of work between us last and best is the reduction of guilt associated with going back to work and actually enjoying having a career and some time for yourself when were at work we dont worry about what the children are doing and we dont feel bad for not being there since one of us is always around sharing childcare seems to offer pretty big emotional benefits both for them and us,2008-04,mike albertine davy child alex aged one linus three mike albertine davy work part time share responsibility looking son linus alex outline

the most honest part of the man is the penis you cant lie to it but what do men want they want immortality i think a woman wants somebody who hears their heart speak i think like a man but have the emotions of a woman and thats really dangerous a man doesnt stand a chance the one big difference between the sexes is that i think women are always looking for love we want more security and to be heard men dont care if you hear them or not they just say what they have to say and leave it to you if you want to listen but i want to be understood not just to be heard i want to be respected and i want to be loved i was living in detroit when i first fell in love he was married i fell hook line and sinker i was gone he signed up my band to our first record deal and he also broke my heart it taught me never to give so much again i collapsed into the love and you shouldnt do that anyone who has had their heart broken learns to keep a little safety area even now in my relationship i have something i can call my own in case something goes wrong you need a place to retreat to i was with my first husband who was my guitar player for years we grew up together we had success together we had kids together he kept me safe and we are really good friends now we will always be i love the guy im really lucky ive had two really good marriages even though one broke up but the important men in my life are all arrogant they all are controlling they all have a great sense of humour and they are all intelligent my present husband is not my type at all hes too pretty too sure of himself almost too nice and he doesnt need me all the things i used to require in a man but he taught me how i could let the woman out and still be suzi quatro the rock chick he let me blossom i have always been a rocker always the tomboy ive found i have a natural inbuilt invisible line where i could be one of the guys and swear and drink and then im a woman and woe betide anyone who crossed that line like backstage somebody might say the cword which to me is the ugliest word in the human language and ill never look at them again im told im an incredible flirt because i dont know im doing it i dont want to even analyse it but i seduce people apparently i suck them in i like to make you drop your guard so you can just talk to me our eyes speaking and i say whats on my mind i guess that can be seductive i have to control my moods i do have a mean side when i get angry but nothing lasts very long with me the one time in my life i didnt let go of my anger my present husband and i had a silly argument and he was slamming the door and i thought i am not going to get mad and eventually it went away normally i would have screamed at him and i sat down to write my bills and then my heart contracted and i had to go to the hospital now it doesnt matter how mad i get he lets me scream hes learned his lesson at my peak i was offered a smorgasbord of sex if i wanted it men and women but i try to live by my standards and just enjoy the fact that you found somebody attractive maybe you could use it as some night time fantasy you know woman are great at fantasising they have a very big dream capacity much bigger than men i mean i can play a million dirty movies in my head unzipped by suzi quatro hodder amp stoughton is out now,2008-04,honest part man penis cant lie men want want

the true cost of violence as more than three million women in the united kingdom discover each year is far too high these women are the victims behind the headline stories of rape domestic violence trafficking and forced marriage that our media reports almost every day their physical injuries range from bruises black eyes and broken bones to permanent disability and occasionally death remember the case of banaz mahmod who was killed by her family for falling in love with the wrong man other physical manifestations of violence like sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies take longer to appear but they can deepen the other less immediately visible consequence of violence psychological damage but let us be clear the effects of this violence is not confined to its three million annual victims one way or another it touches us all we may have been attacked ourselves we may know people in violent relationships we may have friends who have been raped or stalked we may have seen the effect that an attack has had on those close to a victim and almost all women will have experienced the fear of sexual violence which plays such a large part in the in womens fear of crime but the cost of violence is not confined to the physical and psychological trauma of it its victims and their families violence costs taxpayers billions of pounds a year in health care policing and criminal justice and rape crisis centres refuges social workers and health workers have to mop up its aftermath on a daily basis for these and many other reasons tackling violence against women is one of the governments key priorities and i am proud what we have done over the past decade to address this scourge like the introduction of specialist domestic violence courts the rolling out of sexual assault referral centres the establishment of a united kingdom human trafficking centre and increased funding for rape crisis centres we have published a new report tackling violence against women a crossgovernment narrative which shows how government the police local authorities and other agencies are working more closely than ever to tackle domestic violence sexual offences and human trafficking the narrative shows that the number of convictions and successful prosecutions have risen significantly in recent years the number of rape convictions is higher today than in the reporting of rape is more than double today what it was in thanks to improvements in the criminal justice system and support systems which have made victims increasingly confident about coming forward successful prosecutions for domestic violence have increased by half from in to by december some m has been provided by government in the last four years to support victims of sexual violence in addition the new equality duties we have placed on the public sector put this country ahead of most of the world in the area of protection against discrimination the gender equality duty requires public bodies to promote equality between women and men this is a powerful tool in efforts to make sure that local authorities health and police services address issues like violence against women that perpetuate inequality the newly established equality and human rights commission has made it clear that gender equality is a priority for it too but much more needs to be done and the ministers for women are determined to lead a crossgovernment strategy to deal with the root causes of this violence we support the end violence against women coalitions efforts to raise awareness of this scourge by publishing an analysis of how each government department is tackling it i am delighted that the crown prosecution service has for the second year running had the highest score of all departments its violence against women strategy which makes the connections between specific forms of violence is a beacon in whitehall violence against women is an international as well as a national problem and we welcome the recently launched united nations campaign to tackle violence their secretary general ban kimoon says that it is for the women and girls who have the right to live free of violence today and in the future the government wants the united kingdom to be at the forefront of global action to tackle violence against women and we are committed to developing a more strategic approach that allows us to end it meanwhile in the uk rape crisis centres domestic violence refuges and support organisations for women fleeing from violence are quite literally lifesavers they help women to get the safety they need they support them through the justice system and enable them to move on with their lives they also play a critical role in raising awareness about violence against women providing expertise to the government and driving this agenda forward we will continue to work with these organisations and across government to free women from the scourge of violence that is costing them and our country so dear,2008-04,true cost violence three million woman united kingdom discover year far high woman victim behind headline story rape domestic violence trafficking forced

we hope that the failure of police officers to listen to the repeated cries for help from banaz mahmod will not happen to another woman or girl met let down victim killed by her family april the fact that this deadly failure has received such widespread attention and is hopefully being addressed by the police is entirely due to the campaigning efforts of a number of specialist black and minority ethnic womens organisations it is just such organisations which have over the years effected change leading to better protection for women and girls why is it then that minority ethnic womens organisations are under threat of closure due to the hostile environment created by the community cohesion agenda what kind of community cohesion is this creating one where the lives and safety of women and girls counts for nothing vivienne hayes chief executive womens resource centre aisha gill chair newham asian womens project,2008-04,hope failure police officer listen repeated cry help banaz mahmod happen another woman girl met let victim killed family april fact deadly failure ha received widespread attention hopefully addressed police entirely due campaigning effort number specialist black minority ethnic womens organisation organisation year effected change leading better protection woman girl minority ethnic womens organisation threat closure due hostile environment created community cohesion agenda kind community cohesion creating one life safety woman girl count nothing vivienne hayes chief executive womens resource centre aisha gill chair newham asian womens project,"['hope', 'failure', 'police', 'officer', 'listen', 'repeated', 'cry', 'help', 'banaz', 'mahmod', 'happen', 'another', 'woman', 'girl', 'met', 'let', 'victim', 'killed', 'family', 'april', 'fact', 'deadly', 'failure', 'ha', 'received', 'widespread', 'attention', 'hopefully', 'addressed', 'police', 'entirely', 'due', 'campaigning', 'effort', 'number', 'specialist', 'black', 'minority', 'ethnic', 'womens', 'organisation', 'organisation', 'year', 'effected', 'change', 'leading', 'better', 'protection', 'woman', 'girl', 'minority', 'ethnic', 'womens', 'organisation', 'threat', 'closure', 'due', 'hostile', 'environment', 'created', 'community', 'cohesion', 'agenda', 'kind', 'community', 'cohesion', 'creating', 'one', 'life', 'safety', 'woman', 'girl', 'count', 'nothing', 'vivienne', 'hayes', 'chief', 'executive', 'womens', 'resource', 'centre', 'aisha', 'gill', 'chair', 'newham', 'asian', 'womens', 'project']",120
the united states and australia are the only two countries in the industrialised world that dont have paid statutory maternity leave there are exceptions in some us states at least in australia though your job is protected for a year in america even the leave protection only lasts for weeks its an astonishingly backward state of affairs like discovering that france doesnt have a postal service a harvard study of countries measuring how different governments meet the needs of working families found the us to be in the bottom five but rather than do anything so tedious as campaign for reasonable terms american lobbyists have instead thought more laterally with a softly softly lookyafterbaby approach bring your baby to work with you until it can crawl it can think of your workplace as liberty hall there are supposedly at least companies doing this in the us according to the parenting in the workplace institute it is a viable inexpensive tool for helping employees return to work sooner lowering turnover improving morale increasing overall productivity enhancing teamwork and collaboration recruiting new employees attracting new customers and making existing customers more loyal wow it sounds like the robot voice at the beginning of that radiohead song but im afraid if you dont know the one i mean i cant look it up because i am using my google hand to prop up this baby in the interests of researching this idea i have brought my baby into the office but first im going to tell you why i disagree with it to my very core for a start it irks nonparents a typical response from a reader of time magazine after it ran a piece on the trend was this i do not go to work every day to listen to the breeders brats scream all day and to smell their baby poo diapers and i certainly dont want to walk past a cubicle to see some woman breastfeeding her baby no now granted this is a fairly feverish response but only in tone parents are annoying we are selfrighteous and a bit frazzled and were never listening properly and we bring with us a whole load of noise and smell pollution that were not prepared to apologise for and really the only people who can put up with us are other parents not even of older children but of babies exactly the same age nonparents would assume not unfairly that a person fussing over her baby was not doing as much work as everyone else in one of these progressive american firms employees are asked to clock off while they tend their infants to offset these feelings of simmering resentment among colleagues but i dont really think of that as a solution so much as an outrage second if youre being asked to do your job and your childcare at the same time the implication is that one of those things is not work multitasking schmultitasking my friend it is just another word for not concentrating properly and while it is possible to put on laundry with half an eye on a baby it isnt possible to undertake anything complex but you know whatever ideological objections i have if it did work then for a lot of people that would be brilliant im just not sure it did well ill just tell you what happened you decide getting in to work with thurston who is six months old was an incredible slog i got on a packed tube with this toohot baby way too heavy for me in his sling and evilstared the top of this guys head to make him give up his seat for me while he resolutely read his paper pretending not to notice until he finally looked up and it transpired that we knew each other so that was embarrassing even if youre not going to factor in the fact that i was sweating and grunting like a farmyard animal with just the sheer effort of it all how i managed to be only minutes late is beyond me though i did sacrifice my makeup and toothcleaning metime and i also didnt smell my cardigan to see if it was clean which saved me all of about four seconds and stored up a wellspring of shame that lasted throughout the day i cant tell you what it smells of exactly something stewed it definitely isnt clean thurston i have to admit here is a very good baby and doesnt scream much but we started the day at one of those giant meetings full of people who are either definitely or probably very important in all the years i have worked in an office i dont any more but it was probably seven altogether i have made it my business to stay silent in things like this i have no fear of public speaking i just have a horror of accidentally commanding the attention of people and then not knowing what to do with it once ive got it thurston hasnt given this kind of dynamic any thought and yodelled freely from about minutes in people stared they meant it in a nice way but i was custodian of the yodeller and as such i felt as if i should interpret for him turn his noise into remarks of meaning which of course i couldnt do so i just kind of scarpered to recap it is am and i am makeupfree and not exactly clean in a smelly cardigan i arrive i definitely havent got any ideas of my own because the full force of my attention is going into this little sound machine and then i just retreat out of a room with all the ceremony of a person whose pants are on fire i mean its a false experiment in a way because theres all this goodwill of colleagues who know its just for one day and never see me anyway with or without a baby because i work from home so i dont feel terribly vulnerable in my position despite my trampy exterior and the fact that i cant concentrate on what anyone is saying and its all going pretty well if however i had to do this every day and it was a more competitive lawyerly environment or similar and there was a dynamic childless person who was after my job i wouldnt even put up a fight i would just roll over and give it to them meetings arent work though checking emails now thats proper work technically you can do this with a baby on your knee but there are flaws in this plan mine likes to thump the keyboard repeatedly or until he has found select all plus delete whichever is the sooner then he likes to stand up and sit down again and wriggle and grunt and all this makes it really hard to think when im at home i have a whole battery of babypleasing techniques i can sing songs and dance about i have an elaborate mime that i can do with a monkey which pleases him so much he almost always needs a snooze afterwards but for some reason call me crazy i feel inhibited in an openplan office so it is a bit of a grey day from his point of view i feel guilty looking at his bored little face it is much better for me when he goes to sleep except that he has dropped off on my arm which means that i can now only use letters on the lefthand side of the keyboard even though ive been working pretty much since he was born albeit not very hard it has always been in the evenings when he was good for at least an hours snooze with him awake i can just about keep my mind on an email of two lines but nothing longer and i cant hold it together to reply sure employ me in this condition if you want to but i would strongly counsel that it would be cheaper to pay me to stay at home my memory of office life was that you could wait a year for lunchtime to roll around but now mornings appear only to last or minutes suddenly it was pm i hadnt done anything well no i had read a bit of the paper and then thurston had helped me tear it up i had spent about an hour and a half chatting to coworkers which is very much what i would have done in my prechild working life and thats why i started working from home in the first place to thwart my insatiable lust for chat i think from the offices point of view im more of a liability than the baby is but from mine he was a nuisance a lovely nuisance but nevertheless by midafternoon the most taxing task id even undertaken never mind completed was trying to mash half a banana with a chopstick because id forgotten my fork what i did write this took three times easily as long as it would normally have done and since im just describing events as they happen in real time i should have been able to do it with a baby in one arm and a zebra in the other im doing that annoying thing parents do when they cant explain why it doesnt work they just shake their heads and say thats not how it works no you cant just make them go to sleep because its night you cant just persuade them to like lentils you cant tell them to choose a cuddly monkey over the ugly synthetic fish you got free in a service station no you cant take them into work and plonk them in the corner i cant say why thats just not the way it works zoe williams i keep breaking off to gaze adoringly at miri one week after returning to work following my maternity leave and the idea of bringing monthold miri into the office rather appeals both of us shed tears as i left her with the childminder last week sitting back at my desk i felt as if i was missing a vital organ so odd and wrong did it seem to be without her but looking after her is a fulltime job in itself and shes got me well trained about four months in i gave up struggling to write emailsread the paperuse the phone even with her around while scheduled daytime naps are still something i fantasise about im not so sure that having her with me at work is going to well work for me im minutes late not a good start because as we arrive at the guardian she looks sleepy and i push her up and down the street hoping shell have her morning nap she doesnt but she perks up and im reminded of how you feel like royalty with a baby everyone smiles indulgently at me and coos at miri at my desk in the arts department miri lights upon a shelf of dvds and cds with enthusiasm and sets about pulling them off one by one my colleague anna swoops her up and takes her on a tour of the floor allowing me to read a few emails and make a start on the days work next to my feet is a pile of the weekends newspapers a couple of minutes later and miri is eating the sunday telegraph magazine with gusto i offer her a rice cake instead on my lap she reaches forward and grabs the mouse several emails disappear from the computer screen and pieces of puffed rice lodge themselves between the space bar and letters x and c anna comes to my aid again and i manage another minutes work but i keep having to break off to gaze adoringly at miri and plant kisses on the side of her head shes perfectly happy and quiet with anna its me whos having trouble concentrating gareth who sits behind me sensibly puts on headphones nappychanging and feeding are a problem there are very few quiet spaces here and when she starts rooting im still breastfeeding i firmly offer her a bottle i manage to make a couple of phone calls but rather spoil what i hope is my usual professional manner by giggling as she makes a particularly sweet noise and then completely lose the thread of what i was saying she has to eat lunch sitting on my lap so my poor keyboard is now covered in sweet potato and yoghurt by pm she still hasnt slept and is getting overtired my boyfriend not at work today comes to the rescue and takes her home he reports shes asleep within two minutes of leaving the building i feel strangely bereft as i walk back to my desk for me the hardest but perhaps also the best thing about returning to work has been beginning the process of refinding myself remembering who i used to be and that i can relate to people not as a mother its been lovely having miri here but i realise ive now got two identities and i need to keep them separate imogen tilden two hours into the day and ive done zilch the brightontobedford rail line is officially the most overcrowded in britain it is also my route to the office from south london and frankly id rather crawl to work naked with sixmonthold baby charlie strapped to my nipples than squeeze a loaded buggy on there at rushhour so copout no we take the car charlie has a kip on the way as seething traffic makes us late and then having cadged a carpark pass from the boss we get stuck for minutes on the way in as the barrier wont open we havent even arrived and its already past the time for his feed and hes getting impatient as the clock speeds towards his mothers voice does marleys ghost in my head any later than quarterto and therell be trouble panicked i dash past my desk to a quiet corner of the office where i shovel a pureed pear and babyrice combo down his starveling gullet like one of those penguin mothers just back from three months fishing i follow that up with a bottle of the mornings freshly pumped breast milk and as he guzzles i have time to reflect that the supreme barrier to bringing baby to work regularly is anatomical charlie has been on solids for barely a fortnight and still needs topping up by his mum shes dead good with that pump but there are limits i throw a rug beside my desk and get about half an hours grace as belly full and smiling he rolls around with toys but its impossible to concentrate on anything as he flings his rattle around and tries to get my chair leg in his mouth i make one decent phone call commissioning someone to write about football and scan headlines of criminally unread newspapers as colleagues take up the slack and do my job for me the sports desk where i work is the most blokeheavy at the guardian and interruption from admirers is not excessive but the lads muck in gamely shaking charlies toys to distract him when he kicks off royally for the photographer babies are used to being the centre of attention and even occasional efforts to get something done are badly received charlie though sweettempered generally is not impressed by the drab surrounds and grunts of tedium become barks for attention hes briefly mollified by sitting on my lap bashing the keyboard with pudgy fists which makes typing tricky two hours into my day and ive done zilch whatsoever but keep him fed and amused colleagues are patient because they know this is a oneoff but it wouldnt last i feel mortified as nap time arrives tempers worsen through tiredness and the options narrow to walk around the office for minutes as he roars himself to sleep and makes everyone smile through grinding teeth or take the buggy outside and walk him off guess which and yet more work shirked this feels impossible not to mention unfair on both of us by midday its copout no call mum hovering in a nearby cafe and admit defeat ian prior,2008-04,united state australia two country industrialised

i may not have read all the major papers cover to cover over the past weekend but if my attempt at a fairly broad sweep is acceptable i saw only one mention of a revolutionary move in a political party as reported in the herald following a decision at its annual conference the scottish socialist party is to have joint male and female leaders its the second time scotland has explored this route the scottish green party also have male and female coconvenors unfortunately no space was given to the thinking behind this move or its implications for elections and candidacy but revolutionary nevertheless it was and is in one bold move this party has swept aside all the arguments about gender neutrality and meritocracy and replaced them with an acceptance maybe promotion even of gender difference it says men and women are different so a polity must be represented by one of each the fact that the ssp is much depleted post tommy sheridan and that it has a very live history of gender battles of its own should not reduce our interest in the move nor should the limited nature of the move only the party leaders are affected so far diminish the impact of the development if nothing else it presents an opportunity for observers to speculate on the effect such a policy might have on the behaviour and treatment of women in politics and the impact on the broadly acknowledged male often macho culture of our parliaments if eventually there were just as many women around as men jackie ashleys recent column decrying the apparent dearth of feisty swaggering women actually complained that women had become too soft if that is so it is only a recent phenomenon in a political field that is always described in masculine warring terms women have had to put on their armour and imitate the behaviour of soldiers those that have made it to the very top condi rice thatcher golda meir have always prided themselves on their ability to be men in the face of difficulties but if we are to change the dominant culture and its outcomes in any significant way is it not necessary for alternative cultures to be fostered once women have equality still very patchy even in this part of the world though it is the question of difference becomes less charged and more promising is there something specific that women can bring to politics that will begin to reshape the political culture not just its policies if there are enough of them while it is often pointed out that women champion family and children in the policy sphere what do they bring that is new to the way politicians behave in the house of commons for example or to how the government reacts and responds to conflict to date despite david milibands championing of the phrase i have never heard a female politician talk about soft power is it because of the fear of appearing too feminine and by implication too weak when in competition with men for a chance to represent a constituency that may be necessary but when women have a truly equal opportunity to serve it may change dramatically until now women have not emphasised the feminine aspect of their thinking in order to appear gender neutral it may be easier however controversial to identify feminine thinking as something that both men and women are capable of but may represent more women than men for example it is more feminine to respond to conflict with empathy than with a system of control specific feminine abilities include using intuition and emotional intelligence making relationships networking mediating all what you might call soft capacities both in business and in conflict these are increasingly recognised as the strongest qualities not the weakest would more women in public life lead to a less ambiguous appreciation of soft power but it would be no easy task to create the physical mental or most crucially the media space to allow a new feminine culture to emerge and flourish not as feisty competition to masculine culture but as a viable partner to it within the pressures of political life too often women themselves censor words like compassion kindness and love and can betray each other in the race to be a better man than their colleagues just as often they simply dont turn out for each other as if they dont believe in their own vision for change how is it for example that so many women find themselves trapped in the fight to be allowed to work often for a pittance at the expense of being able to take care of their children why do so many women accept that the ideal of having both a family and a career can only be pursued by juggling and a selfish greed for having it all why is the feminine call for a more rounded life both for women and men not regarded as completely acceptable to politicians and the media so much so that they would fund it such a change in culture is still far off but it could come into view if there was a huge influx of women into public life in the past year i have begun to visit a number of womens groups not political feminists pursuing rights but women exploring the feminine spirit regular attendees range from psychologists to company directors only some are mothers after a lifetime of denying their differences with men they have begun to dig them out and prize them our conversations cover anything from consciousness to poverty war to spirituality most challenging is the ideal of not setting goals and agendas but just prizing our ability to be together as women and seeing what emerges outside of the usual frameworks and priorities in stark contrast to so many other meetings and salons that i attend these meetings are passionate joyful and hopeful what might be the effect of this kind of input consistently expressed in policy making allowing women to take an equal share of responsibility in public life may sound logical but it is still revolutionary and a long way off but thanks to the scottish greens and socialists it is

truth is often said to be the first casualty in wartime but if the real truth is told it is women who are the first casualties in conflict zones the united nations childrens agency unicef recently observed sexual violence usually spreads like an epidemic whether it is civil war pogroms or other armed conflicts all too often womens bodies become part of the battlefield the victims of largescale sexual atrocities range from baby girls to old women in darfur janjaweed militia kidnapped a yearold girl and gangraped her for a week pulling her legs so far apart that she was crippled for life the biggest fear of rape victims in darfur however is that they will never find a husband under sharia law raped women are prosecuted for adultery or fornication last year at least two young women in sudan were sentenced to death by stoning as refugees international observes the government is more likely to take action against those who report and document rape than those who commit it in the wars now savaging the democratic republic of congo rape victims also take most of the blame after being raped congolese women are banished by their husbands and ostracised by their communities often they are genitally mutilated by a gunshot or tossed on a fire naked in cultures where girls and women are married off and chastity is central to womanhood all is lost for a woman who loses her honour the subsequent stigma often is a heavier burden than the assault itself so it should be no surprise that most of these wounded girls and women keep silent during the balkan wars of the s women were raped for the purpose of bearing the enemys children according to european union estimates women in bosnia alone were victims of rape the women have been largely left to themselves traumatised by their experiences and condemned to a life of poverty in an estimated two million women were victims of the red armys sexual cruelties not only german women but also jewish women in hiding concentration camp survivors and resistance fighters according to the german journalist ruth andreasfriedrich the shame felt about lost honour created an atmosphere of suicide in april there were more than suicides in berlin husbands fathers and teachers pressured women and girls to end their own lives after russian soldiers raped them because their honour was their major concern for many girls and women nonmarital sex remains worse than death so it is all the more striking and painful that for so long this specific war crime has received little attention during the second world war the prohibition on rape by soldiers was well established in international law but the postwar nuremberg and tokyo war crimes tribunals prosecuted only a handful of cases during the genocide in rwanda mass rape was the rule but sexual assault was included only accidentally and secondarily in the rwanda tribunals indictments after a rwandan woman spontaneously declared before the tribunal that she and other women had been raped before the massacre a female judge followed up and revealed the enormous scale of sexual violence against women the rwanda tribunal was the first in history to describe rape as a possible act of genocide in the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia in the hague condemned the systematic rape of women as a crime against humanity in the landmark foca case the icty convicted three bosnian serbs of rape torture and enslavement of muslim women in girls some of them just years old were gangraped for weeks yet the perpetrators of wartime mass rape and other forms of sexual violence usually are not prosecuted recently the congolese militia leader thomas lubanga became the first prisoner to be tried at the international criminal court in the hague for the recruitment of child soldiers yet the indictments failure to mention violence against women is a huge shock to the victims according to congolese human rights organisations in a petition they asked the icc to investigate mass rapes committed by all parties in the conflict the impunity that is characteristic of these heinous crimes must stop rape and other forms of sexual violence against women should be openly discussed by governments members of parliament militia leaders and opinion leaders prosecution must become the rule the icc and other tribunals must give a clear signal to the perpetrators for women who have been victims of rape there are no monetary benefits memorials or mourning rituals that must change as well there should be a monument to the unknown raped woman at the icc maybe then its judges would pay closer attention to sexual violence against women in association with project syndicate,2008-05,truth often said first casualty wartime real truth told woman first casualty conflict

tina downham a former headhunter has been a fulltime mum to holli and daisy four for the past six years and she loves it to be in a situation where you can enjoy your children and not pay somebody else to look after them is great she says looking after children is the biggest job you will ever have if you put them in nursery you get the worst of them at the beginning and the end of the day how do you ever do any bonding but downham has seen things from both sides in her old company she managed a team of people working fulltime while holli was in nursery as a toddler she was so stressed and harried that she remembers trailing an ambulance through rush hour traffic to get to work on time one day she picked her daughter up from nursery at the pm cutoff time and holli then three said mummy do i have to be the last one here she realised it was time to quit it makes me feel sick when i think about what i had to juggle she and husband clive a power tools executive downsized to one salary and moved from buckinghamshire to taunton she blames materialism for the fact that few women want to do what she has done i dont know why there arent a few more mums going without a few things because what you get back is so much more but downhams views are increasingly rare and she is one of a dying breed around seven out of eight mothers now work according to a report published last week by yougov the number of stayathome mothers has dropped by a quarter in the past years in there were million fulltime mothers in the uk the new research estimates that the figure will fall below million by the survey concluded that most parents cannot afford for one of them not to work couples think they need an income of before they can afford for the mother to stay at home and the average male income in the uk is this is proof that a stayathome parent is a logistical impossibility for most households these conclusions are fascinating if slightly questionable as anyone who lives in an affluent middleclass suburb of london will tell you in some areas there is no shortage of fulltime mothers if anything their numbers appear to have increased in recent years part of the yougov research is based on a survey of only people and almost all of it is heavily weighted how do you define stayathome mother what if youre on maternity leave or a shortterm career break the overall picture nationwide however is undeniable there are now fewer stayathome mothers than ever and the credit crunch is only likely to send more mothers back to work interestonly mortgages and fixedterm rates coming to an end are a powerful motivation to return i know of several fulltime mothers who have started job searches in recent weeks this is what is sad for the current generation of mothers says mary aston who left her job in a bank in to be a fulltime mother to to william now libby and kathy in bruton somerset her husband mark is a crops specialist she did not work again for years i feel very sorry for parents nowadays who both feel they have to go out to work she says mothers miss out on a lot if theyre not with their children between nought and five i was lucky that i didnt have to work we didnt have any money i remember having a week for everything but we didnt mind i felt bringing up the children was the best rolei could have nowadays parents feel guilty about not going to work in those days i would have felt guilty if i did go to work until as recently as the s it was assumed that to be anything other than a fulltime mother was damaging to children but the nonworking mother is a purely thcentury construct women have always worked whether they were paid for it or not in what my fouryearold son calls the olden days children were brought up not by one woman but by an extended family it is only in recent history that we have started to worry about things such as whether your parents mess you up by working or not working the stayathome mother was born in the s and s as domestic service died says professor pat thane of the institute of historical research by the end of the second world war mothers had to look after their own children because they couldnt find other women to do it she says this coincided with the growth of a middle class who could afford for a woman to stay at home crucially at the same time news of an exciting new science psychology was reaching a mass audience lots of women listened to childcare experts influenced by modern psychology whose work was available in cheap paperbacks in the s this new thinking most of it under the banner of attachment theory put a new onus on the mother and the mother alone to form an exclusive bond with her child women in this postwar period already suffered from exactly the same double bind that mothers have today in the s many women of childbearing age found themselves welleducated and newly equipped with work skills but they were also living in a culture where it was considered best to stay at home with your children surely it had to be if psychological experts said so this view has persisted to this day many mothers cite financial necessity as the reason they work implying that if they did not need the money they would do the right thing and stay at home at least though we now have the choice in the first wave of feminism many women began to question their roles as wives and mothers some virtually walking out on their families the daughter of the feminist author alice walker has recently spoken of her mother officially resigning from her maternal role in provincial britain however this radicalism passed a lot of women by in the early s joy gower from norwich gave up the job she loved as manager of a hair salon to stay at home for years with her sons gareth and lee now and respectively my husband did not approve of his wife going out to work he thought that if you had children it was your duty to stay at home i did enjoy bringing my sons up but i also wanted to be me i was glad that i could be there for all the sports days but i do look back now and see that i was oppressed there is some sadness and regret i was capable of a lot more despite feminism she says it was everyones expectation in the s that a woman should stay at home i didnt know any women who were working at that time unless they were childminding or starting up a nursery i did as many things as i possibly could to keep my mind occupied including an open university course but a lot of us had husbands who would say well if you are going to work you still have to do all the housework anyway it was easier she says to take the housekeeping money and keep quiet eventually she trained as a manager for avon and later as a hypnotherapist once her boys grew up she divorced and later remarried choice though has brought a pressure to bear on todays stayathome mothers they are made to feel they should justify their existence as erika sales fulltime mother to oscar two and francis four in twickenham southwest london explains you do get this feeling sometimes that youre not good enough any more in that workplace sense that maybe people think youre not as intelligent any more you remind yourself that isnt true but it does knock your confidence there are times when i think i should look for a job but then i have to remind myself that its not what i want to do she left a career in marketing to stay at home her husband adrian is an accountant luckily she says she has a lot of friends who are in the same position a lot of the mums at the school gate are stayathome those who do work work parttime or from home so no i dont feel unusual several of my friends are the same age and in the same situation we feel that weve had our careers and we dont have to go back like many older mothers after two decades of work she feels that she has achieved everything she wanted and now this is her family time i do think i would have a different relationship with the children if i was working i would probably feel that i would have to spoil them more to make up for not being there i just like them knowing i am there for them all the time sales also wanted to replicate the experience she had with her own stayathome mother over the years this has been a common motivation faith quance from sheffield married at in and had a daughter and two sons over the next six years trained as a medical secretary she did not go back to work for years i just wanted to be at home with them and do the things my own mother had done for me she says there were times later when i regretted it on a personal level but not from the familys point of view i didnt resent being at home with my children i enjoyed it although we could have done with more money having watched her children bring up her four grandchildren however she sees now that things can be done differently and she has reevaluated her views on nursery some of my anxieties to do with not being the principle carer have been rebutted by seeing how well nursery children do they gain all sorts of social skills that the child who was at home with mum doesnt seem to have one of my grandchildren was in childcare from six months and he is a very extrovert sociable child and has gained a lot from it i dont condemn people who send their children to nursery but i didnt want it years ago i dont know if i would be different now she does not envy her daughters generation the cost of everything is so enormous and peoples expectations are unrealistic they want to have these beautiful homes and it just isnt possible to do that and have contented children if the financial situation is complex for a lot of families at the moment there is at least one positive development says jill harris mother of tom and olivia seven from warlingham surrey flexible working last year she went back to work after six years at home i didnt intend to become a stayathome mother and certainly not for that long i just didnt believe that there were genuine parttime flexible jobs out there things have changed considerably in the past five years a former communications executive she now works as a schools manager with women like us a london recruitment firm that links up companies looking for highly qualified candidates for parttime positions they explicitly recruit fulltime mums who have dropped out of the job market the rise in flexibility has to be one of the main factors in the decline of fulltime motherhood but the real nail in the coffin has been the housing market i feel quite strongly that this generation was fed a bit of a lie says francesca todd the practicalities of bringing up children and running a house have not changed if anything it has got harder because the price of property has gone through the roof the mother of jemima four and william one she and her musician husband nick moved from southeast london to welwyn garden city herts and downsized so that she could give up her office job in the civil service but they still need two salaries she works from home two days a week fulltime motherhood was not an option she says because she enjoys her work too much and if childcare were less expensive she would work more the yougov survey also found that the cost of childcare has risen by in the past six years and will rise another by what im doing now is the right thing for the children but it has been really hard and at times extremely lonely and dull todd says but when i was both working in an office and looking after the children it was the hardest time of my life i would have to put on this professional mask in the morning and pretend to be cheerful at work when i had been up all night with the children at least if youre a fulltime mother you can hide away be grumpy and not have to pretend that youre having it all and doing it all pippa menzies also embodies this new kind of working stayathome motherhood she and her husband rory do not have any childcare for jake three jamie months and archie five months they look after the children themselves but they also run riverdale house a bampb in alfriston east sussex she left her career running an mps office to spend more time with the children politics and family life do not mix its impossible its a hour job she says then theres the money element as soon as you have two children its not financially worthwhile and work becomes a luxury now the children have fulltime parents but were working as well one thing has been completely lost she says we have got a lot more family time together but there is no time for yourself at all because it is relentless its either the kids or the business or both you have to make a sacrifice though no matter what you do sometimes its money sometimes its career sometimes its the children she has days when she doubts herself yesterday jamie poured a pot of hot tea over himself and i found myself thinking if i was a proper fulltime mum would he have done that but thats the state of modern motherhood i think you feel guilty whatever you do at least to her children she says she has the appearance of being a traditional mother while for herself she still maintains an income and a career perhaps rather than disappearing the stayathome mother has reappeared in a more creative entrepreneurial form even tina downham in taunton a staunch supporter of fulltime motherhood is starting a second career as an artist she has just sold her first painting for meanwhile though mothers now face numerous pressures and difficult decisions there will always be a small army of stayathome mothers who love what they do and dont want to change it for the world and to hell with social trends as long as you can afford it as sales puts it the thing is i do absolutely adore being at home with my children thats what gets you through when youre thinking that maybe you should go back to work or that youre not good enough you are there for every moment when they do every little thing for the first time and i just love that that is the reason you do it this article was amended on wednesday may we inadvertently changed the gender of professor pat thane of

most new fathers like to spend some time at home when their babies are born the introduction of two weeks of paid paternity leave was intended to make this easier but the new rules are not all they were cracked up to be not everyone qualifies for paternity pay and even when they do the benefit is so low that many fathers dont bother to claim paternity leave for employees was introduced five years ago it allows fathers or the partner of a woman having a child including samesex partners to take up to two weeks of paid leave after their baby is born within days after the birth during their leave fathers receive statutory paternity pay which is or per cent of their average weekly earnings if this figure is lower employers can reclaim all or nearly all of the leave from their national insurance contributions claiming paid paternity leave however is not always straightforward as alastair macdonald from armadale in scotland discovered last year macdonald was disappointed to find that he was not eligible for paid paternity leave on the arrival of his third child because he had changed his job within weeks of the expected date of birth even though the job change was not voluntary because he had been made redundant he says that his new employers are only a small firm so they couldnt afford to pay me if they werent able to reclaim the money from the government they offered me unpaid leave instead but i couldnt afford to take time off without my wages he believes it would be fairer if eligibility was based on his national insurance contribution record pointing out that he has been paying contributions continuously since he started work at most men dont have a problem claiming paternity pay says kathy rogan rights adviser at working families the worklife balance campaign organisation but difficulties can arise she warns sometimes employers will refuse because an employee hasnt given them the full weeks written notice required in another case a man was threatened with losing a substantial part of his bonus if he took the time off but we told him his employer could not do this as in law you cannot be subjected to a detriment if you assert a right sometimes small employers will say they havent heard of paternity pay but in this situation the easiest way for an employee to enforce his right is to complain direct to the revenue as they are responsible for administering paternity pay we also get queries from selfemployed men but unfortunately they dont qualify anyway even when fathers are eligible for paternity pay they do not always claim it adrienne burgess research manager at the fatherhood institute says paternity pay is so low that many men cant afford to take paternity leave although around per cent of men take time off around the time of their babys birth many use their ordinary holiday entitlement instead the general feeling is that professional men tend to take paternity leave because they work for the type of companies that will top up the benefit so they get their full salary but they are in the minority the majority of men in lowerpaid jobs are unlikely to get a topup from their employer so they will use their holiday entitlement in order to remain on full pay but this is terrible for families because it means dads ordinary holiday is squeezed the charity working families would like to see paternity pay increased jonathan swan its policy and research officer says we would like it brought into line with the first six weeks of statutory maternity pay when mothers receive per cent of their usual weekly earnings this would give fathers a proper incentive to take paternity leave we would also like it to be extended and made more flexible so it does not have to be taken in one block there are also criticisms of the governments plans for additional paternity leave which it has pledged to introduce before the end of the current parliament this would give employed fathers a right to take an additional weeks off work with pay to care for their child in its first year in place of the mother if she has returned to work and not used all her paid maternity leave adrienne burgess of the fatherhood institute says one of the problems with these plans is that fathers wont be able to take the leave unless their partner is entitled to maternity leave so if the woman is not working or is selfemployed then fathers wont get it also because the government wants to encourage breastfeeding fathers wont be able to take the leave in the first six months of the babys life we see this as social engineering on the part of the government they should grant parental leave and let couples choose how they take it they also need to pay fathers per cent or per cent of their salary during their leave otherwise very few will take it up fortunately for alastair macdonald who wasnt eligible for paid paternity leave his wife mhari had their daughter ceilidh on christmas eve so he had a few days of paid holiday straight after the birth anyway tax help for families on the plus side there are child benefit and child tax credits that can help to boost the familys income child benefit is given automatically and is currently per week for the first child and for other children child tax credits depend on income but according to the government nine out of families qualify most get at least the basic family element worth for the current tax year if their income is no more than a year up to if you have a child under one for lower earners a child element is also available which is worth up to and is payable for each child working tax credits may also be available depending on income and the number of children in the family according to hmrc figures a couple with an income of with two children could qualify for combined child and working tax credits of a year or a week families who are eligible for working tax credit can additionally receive help with per cent of eligible childcare costs up to a maximum of per week for one child or for two or more children eligibility inquiries can be made through a confidential tax credits helpline parents also receive a child trust fund of to invest taxfree on behalf of their new arrival they can add a further per year to the account but there will also be plenty of expenses associated with a new arrival in particular parents should remember to take out extra life insurance says graeme mitchell of independent financial advisers lowland financial to protect their dependents against financial hardship in case of their early death term assurance is the cheapest option,2008-05,new father like spend time home baby born introduction two week paid paternity leave wa intended make easier new rule cracked everyone qualifies

during the un operation in somalia local women who ventured outside the refugee camps to collect firewood were frequently raped by peacekeepers in cambodia the prostitute population of phnom penh increased from to while the un was present elsewhere un soldiers have been known to establish their own prostitution rackets when these problems have been brought to the notice of the un leadership complaints have often been fobbed off with the excuse that boys will be boys clearly putting on a blue helmet does not transform a soldier into a saint the atrocities that one usually associates with war are too often found in operations dedicated to peace dag hammarskjld the nobel peace prize winner and second secretarygeneral of the un once said that peacekeeping is too important to be undertaken by soldiers but he added soldiers are the only ones who can do it unfortunately few soldiers are given the training to transform themselves into effective peacekeepers the solution might lie with a few good women female soldiers can improve the effectiveness of operations for the simple reason that they are not men perception is crucial here in other words the way peacekeepers behave is important but so too is the way they are expected to behave by the local population thus the presence of a man can be provocative even if that man has no intention to provoke on the other hand a woman tends to calm stressful situations because she is expected to be peaceful even a token woman can have an enormous impact in december the dallas morning news reported on the peculiar success of dutch troops in najaf in contrast to american units in baghdad dutch troops according to the newspaper always take a woman along while conducting housetohouse searches she ensures that troops respect local customs regarding malefemale contact as a result local iraqis are comfortable with the dutch even as they resent american soldiers female soldiers have an additional benefit namely in reducing the incidence of genderbased violence a study for the un division for the advancement of women found that the incidence of rape and prostitution falls significantly with just a token female presence stated simply men behave better when in the presence of women from their own culture im not arguing that women make better peacekeepers than men highlytrained male combat soldiers will always be necessary particularly in the early stages of deployment what the evidence does suggest however is that the presence of women improves an operations chances of success a better gender balance means that the operation more closely resembles civilian society its members are therefore more likely to observe social conventions that define civilised behaviour the maledominated un has been resistant to the sort of reforms a more gendersensitive approach implies the reason invariably given is that womens issues must take second place to matters of security but this is not just a case of being nice

since the beginning of the year the boards of norwegian public limited companies have had to be female if they dont comply the state will shut them down sound like a crazy idea well it has worked norwegian company boards now have the highest number of female directors anywhere in the world perhaps britain should consider introducing a similar initiative the law was the brainchild of an unlikely feminist icon former businessman ansgar gabrielsen was a conservative trade and industry minister when he announced the law in i could not see why after years of having an equal ratio of women and men in universities and having so many educated women with experience there were so few of them on boards he told me the law was not about getting equality between the sexes it was about the fact that diversity is a value in itself that it creates wealth from my time in the business world i saw how board members were picked they come from the same small circle of people they go hunting and fishing together they are buddies today many directors ive spoken to say boards have become more competent board recruiters have been forced to look beyond their immediate circles of friends and colleagues the pool of candidates has widened so you have more chances of getting good directors and since you have people with more diverse backgrounds you have a multiplicity of opinions and approaches at board meetings which leads to better decisionmaking the law has focused peoples minds on diversity instead of endless talkingshops about breaking the glass ceiling people have had to think practically about how to have more women in top executive positions it has given rise to other initiatives too the confederation of norwegian enterprise nho which had started a programme called female future to put female board candidates in touch with company owners has now launched another initiative called ethnic future the aim is to promote more men and women from ethnic minorities to executive positions many women who took part in female future were also offered top management positions not just directorships company owners saw their cv in the programmes database thought they would be good for their companies and offered them jobs in the uk only of directors of ftse firms were female in how long do we have to wait until the generations of experienced women that have been working in business for decades get to these positions the debate often focuses on what women should do more to get the seats they should get more experience they should spend more time at work they should cultivate more networks aside from the fact that that women are already doing that this argument is focusing on the wrong group of people the debate should be about board recruiters why do they pick only men change doesnt happen naturally it always needs to be provoked with bold initiatives they are always decried at the beginning and then they are taken for granted gabrielsen did exactly that he announced the quota law without consulting his party leader or the prime minister his party the conservatives at first protested but then fell into line the leftwing parties had not other choice but to follow suit meanwhile the business community which at first was up in arms eventually took the pragmatic approach and complied with the law none of the directors i spoke to thought quotas are a good idea per se however they thought they were necessary to bring about change perhaps its time britain does the same,2008-05,since beginning year board norwegian public limited company

couple that can adjust to change in our case what works is that we like each other frankly i dont know exactly why but we do its a mystery my relationship works with him for the same reason that my relationship with my mother works because we accept each other she gave up trying to change me and i gave up trying to change her a long time ago we have had so much tragedy in our lives and without therapy we never would have survived as a couple when i started talking about divorce he said no lets try therapy first so we did and it worked we have children who were drug addicts drugs can destroy

so completely when i was a young girl that it was as if he never existed i didnt even know his name for a long time nobody ever talked about him and we never asked because there was this feeling in the air that if you did ask something horrible would happen like my mother would get sick i think that my close relationship with my mother began when my father left my mother says that it began in the womb she has another two boys but doesnt have that same connection i was when i met my first husband i come from a family of no touching so the first time a man touched me it transformed my life i felt something open up inside me i fell in love madly desperately i was when we divorced when you are recently divorced you hate that person two years later the feelings have vanished he was a very good man when i compare my present marriage with the past with miguel it was like foam you could pass through willie is a solid presence that doesnt mean hes rigid but hes there most men respond well to kindness when they are young they want sex to spread their seed as they age their desires change i like men who are like golden retrievers like big strong animals with a kind loyal heart in my relationships with men i look for strength kindness assertiveness i detest male shabbiness by which i mean men that treat women as inferiors my biggest sexual fantasy is antonio banderas hes a very nice guy i find him very sexual in an understated way and not at all macho macho men bother me hes a great dancer a great singer he has a selfdeprecating humour i dream of devouring him naked covered

last autumn we discovered that our yearold brother george has a social learning disability up to now we his sisters and parents have been thoroughly perplexed as to why this welleducated and intelligent man cannot meet the personal and financial responsibilities of an adult since finishing university almost years ago he has gone from one disaster to the next unemployment homelessness depression and unstable relationships with unstable partners george is living in poverty and suffers from depression he lives and works in a windowless basement bedsit in a large north american city that he has called home for most of his adult life in part his poverty arises because he does not earn enough money to live on he is selfemployed a freelance computer programmer although his hourly wage is high he doesnt work enough hours to achieve an adequate income he is reluctant to search for fulltime employment and in the past has had trouble in obtaining or keeping a job he is a bit of a social misfit and not comfortable in groups of people and people are not always comfortable with him he can on the other hand be funny entertaining and kind he has a number of good friends several of whom he has known since his university days to add to the equation george has a fouryearold daughter he is struggling to support he and his daughters mother split up last year and his daughter lives with her mother george lives near them and is actively involved in his daughters parenting on an almost daily basis a problem that significantly compounds georges financial difficulties is that he is unable to manage the money he earns he regularly hands over large chunks of money to his daughters mother without having first paid his own rent phone transport or food sometimes he behaves childishly spending money on luxuries that should have been used to pay bills although similar behaviour has contributed to him being homeless in the past he does not seem to have learnt from the experience another recent consequence of this behaviour was his telephone land line being cut off because the account was in arrears his only phone is a payasyougo mobile which is regularly out of credit and he has lost freelance work because his clients are unable to contact him although our now very elderly parents have consistently stood by george and provided substantial financial support he has no on the ground family support in his city our family are scattered around america and the uk georges social learning disability was identified by chance by a relative a schoolteacher who works with children with disabilities while she was visiting his city she contacted us with her concerns and encouraged us to obtain professional help for him she explained that because social learning disabilities such as georges have only been identified within the past to years many people of georges generation have fallen through the social safety net the knowledge that george has a social learning disability was an enormous help to our family it gave us an explanation for his puzzling behaviour and was a first step in getting him help we began discussing georges problems to identify his immediate and longterm needs and to find practical solutions an important concern was to take the burden of georges welfare away from our elderly parents among our goals were to communicate with george more regularly so that we can be more supportive of his daily life find professional support longterm social and financial assistance as well as housing that is more appropriate for him and his daughter create financial safety nets for the future the internet has proved to be an enormously useful tool to improve communication between us and given that we are all on broadband we including our parents each signed up to the voiceoverinternet telephone service skype calls are free between computers and for a small charge can also be made to and from landline phones significantly george is now much more accessible as he can be phoned on his skype number as well as his mobile which as he now uses it less is rarely out of credit we recognised that it might be months before george receives financial assistance so we worked on helping him to stabilise his financial situation he has trouble in budgeting his income and expenditures he is unable to prioritise his subsistence needs over other bills so we looked for ways to help him conceptualise his expenses according to their order of importance using a computer spreadsheet program george is familiar with we constructed a visually simple budgeting system that classifies his expenses in order of importance into three colourcoded groups a blue group which we titled critical subsistence needs which includes rent phone transport and food and an emergency fund a green group which includes maintenance payments for georges daughter and expartner a yellow group entitled contingencies which includes all nonsubsistence expenditures including leisure activities and recreational items to insure that his subsistence needs are paid expenses in the blue group must be paid before money can be used for either of the other two groups likewise both the blue and green groups must be paid before money is spent on the yellow group in terms of longterm safety nets we have done several things for one we encouraged george to develop buffer zones in preparation for months where his income may be lower or if he is unwell and unable to work one example was giving his landlady advance rent payments our parents changed their will so that any inheritance he might receive from them will go into a discretionary trust to protect george from his own spendthrift habits as well as from being exploited by others the changes are slow in part because of georges disability he has been tardy in following through on those tasks that must be accomplished in order for him to be properly assessed for instance making appointments with healthcare workers and finding relevant paperwork it is more than three months since the community support team became involved and george has still not been assessed or received financial assistance outside that provided by the family but we are optimistic because over the past three months his emotional state is now much improved which in turn is helping him to address his other problems what a credit counsellor suggests geeta varma managing counsellor at the consumer credit counselling service thinks that georges family have done a great job in helping him but gives the following additional tips while a colourcoding system is an excellent method of sorting the type of expense and makes payments easier for the critical subsistence needs and priority outgoings george could also look at using direct debits or standing orders on a bank account to make smaller more regular payments on periodic expenses such as utilities providing there are sufficient funds in the bank account this could help open a second bank account to use as a piggy bank for the yellow leisure and recreational expenses in which any leftover money can be saved after georges essential outgoings have been covered this could provide an additional benefit by creating a shortterm savings facility because george has a social learning disability he may need help with managing bank accounts and this would be easier if basic nofrills accounts were set up in joint names with a family member who could offer help and support with managing the accounts especially if online access is available to them,2008-05,last autumn discovered yearold brother george ha social learning disability sister parent thoroughly perplexed welleducated intelligent man meet personal financial responsibility adult

eighty years ago this week women won the right to vote on the same terms as men the culmination of a battle that depending on where you think it first began had already lasted at least a century like so many longanticipated revolutions it ended a deep injustice without having quite the transformative effect on political priorities that some had hoped it turns out that equality a universally recognised indicator of the health of a society does not just happen it has to be fought for and each gain has to be protected that is why harriet harmans equality bill although its ambition goes well beyond gender equality is necessary it also explains the outraged howls that met the proposals when they were unveiled last week selfevidently britain is not an equal society women now do better at school and university than men but still earn less at work some ethnicminority britons experience persistent health inequalities disabled people routinely struggle to enjoy the same opportunities as their peers and pensioners individual medical and care needs often seem invisible to the professionals they encounter the new bill is an important signal that the government is prepared to do something about it although not as much as the campaigners would like the most contentious of the proposals is to allow employers to discriminate in order to achieve diversity this has been widely assumed to mean that men will suffer unjustly but there will be occasions when in the interests of diversity a man is the best choice in theory that is as illegal at the moment as not hiring a woman because she is of childbearing age this is the boldest of proposals that elsewhere show signs of having been diluted by a nervous government on the intractable pay gap ms harman believes greater transparency will have an important cultural impact certainly if women have evidence that men are paid more for work of equal value they can start to ask questions but that is only the start whitehall pay audits introduced five years ago have apparently done nothing to deter the treasury from paying men on average more than women more work is needed to explain whether this is pay policy or job segregation meanwhile even where equal pay cases have been successful tribunals cannot impose equality on an employer unless the employee is still there some local authorities losers in several longdrawn out equal value cases say they cannot afford to pay their women employees what they are owed the bill has no answers while its timescale is vague and its enforcement processes are so far illdefined and likely to affect only larger employers so not the end of the battle just one more skirmish,2008-06,eighty year ago week woman right vote term men culmination battle depending think

when i was and looking for my first proper job i successfully sat the aptitude test for the post office then a few weeks afterwards i was called in for an interview i was told that id done really well in the exam and that i was one of only two candidates shortlisted for the vacancy it was between me and a bloke of the same age so far so good everything went well until about midway through my grilling when one of the managers asked youre not planning to do anything silly like get married and have babies are you if i remember rightly this was the point at which my jaw momentarily hit the floor fully aware that this was a totally inappropriate question in fact unlawful and blatantly discriminatory even back then in but desperate for the job and not wanting to make a bad impression by appearing confrontational i mumbled something vague like no of course not not for a few years anyway and hoped that that would be enough to persuade him no surprises there of my suitability for a career in such a prestigious institution suffice to say i didnt get the job sir alan sugar recently argued that not being able to find out about a persons intentions to have children or not creates an air of uncertainty it puts doubts in the mind of a prospective employer about the commitment and suitability of the candidate for the job the reality is that some employers are hesitant to employ women in key roles regretfully theres concern in the back of their minds that women may not be a good choice because they may come with complications and have their work and career disrupted by family stuff he went on to suggest that the employment laws disallowing a prospective employer from asking a woman questions about her childcare arrangements should be scrapped and that instead women should be encouraged to explain to their interviewers just how organised they are when it comes to sorting out who looks after the kids thus alleviating any worries that family stuff might get in the way of their work performance sugars comments which openly acknowledged and further encouraged the discrimination women are subjected to in the jobs market met with barely a whimper from the mainstream media a striking contrast to the reception given on thursday to harriet harmans announcement of the new equality bill the difference harmans proposals are aimed at alleviating the endemic and structural inequalities faced by both women and ethnic minorities in the workplace let the backlash commence white men face jobs ban as new favours ethnic minorities and women screamed the front page of the daily express while the mail talked about the controversial new equality bill that could discriminate against white men well im sorry if this sounds harsh but quite frankly i really couldnt care less if privileged white men are about to get a taste of their own medicine but theyre not anyway so i dont understand what all the fuss is about as yvonne roberts pointed out yesterday under the new law employers can give preferential treatment to women and ethnic minorities if equally qualified without the risk of being sued note that phrase if equally qualified theres no suggestion that women or minority ethnic candidates should be allowed to jump ahead of betterqualified white male candidates and no suggestion that members of underrepresented groups with fewer qualifications should be privileged over other candidates simply because they identify as members of those groups this is positive action not positive discrimination and as harman sayspdf the new legislation will simply give more scope for employers if they want to increase the number of women or black or asian employees under these proposals public sector employers wont be forced to employ more women but if the employer feels that their workforce isnt reflective of the diversity of the community they serve this new bill will enable them to change all that while at the same time removing any fear of a legal challenge from unsuccessful candidates theres nothing controversial about this it simply reinforces what some decent employers have been trying to achieve for years but it gives them the added protection of a legal defence if theyre ever called upon to justify their decision strangely enough theres rarely a comparable outcry when it comes to the outrageous differential between the hourly pay rates of fulltime men compared to parttime women workers when women are systematically discriminated against paid less sacked or refused employment because theyre pregnant or theres a possibility they might

harriet harman is under fire again for proposing that employers should be allowed to discriminate in order to ensure diversity this has got a great storm going in those parts of the media that are fuelled by stories about politicalcorrectnessgonemad positive discrimination is in the eye of the beholder which is why it has been used since time immemorial to ensure that white middle class men get all the best jobs harman wants to use it to help employers make sure their companies reflect the world around them which means she says that when faced with two or more candidates of otherwise equal merit the employer can select the one that most fits their diversity requirements that might be the black candidate or the female candidate and if the job was for a primary school teacher it would probably be the male candidate for some warped reason it is considered acceptable to discuss the shortage of male role models in junior schools but pc madness to propose a solution to the lack of women role models at company board level it seems likely that some employers certainly larger ones and those like the bbc that operate very publicly discreetly discriminate already it would be very hard to prove that they didnt although the persistence in some sectors of the mainlywhite work force suggests that they must and consider the inequity of the allwomen workplace where low pay is the norm and the extraordinary difficulty of proving that the womens work is of equal value to mens care assistants versus gardeners for example in many local authorities more diversity in the workplace might offer a better solution as long as the pay differential wasnt imported with the men when harman commissioned research around whitehall to see what impact pay audits introduced in have had she found that the treasury still on average pays men more than women it seems likely that the reason is not that men and women doing the same job are paid differently but that there are not enough women in the top jobs and possibly not enough men in the bottom ones either how except by positive discrimination is that inequality to be resolved an ethnicity audit would probably be even more scandalous every stage in achieving equality has been met first with derision for the women who point out that they are being discriminated against and by howls of outrage about unfairness to men when action is finally taken at last the government is acting to remove one excuse for the lack of women and black and ethnic minorities in good jobs it is not going to work magic but it is one more brick in the

harriet harman seems rather confused with her plans about the gender pay gap we have structural discrimination on pay indeed we do and rightly so there is a gender pay gap and what we should be interested in are the reasons that gap exists and persists our reaction might be different if we find that the gap is caused by rampant sexism by capitalist pigdogs directly discriminating against women than it would be if there were some innate differences between men and women that made them pursue different goals that direct discrimination does indeed exist although thankfully at much lower levels than in previous decades the women at work commission report told us that direct discrimination accounts for of the gender pay gap in the financial services industry the rest is indeed caused by other factors theres a multiplicity of these other factors as well maternity leave means substantial time out of the workforce leading to other things being equal lower human capital the desire to spend time raising said children rather than chasing promotion leads among those who so decide to lower wages women take more sick leave than men and yes at least some of it is due to the biological difference between the sexes the reproductive differences there are many more of such findings and yes when totted up they do explain the rest of that gender pay gap all of these latter differences lead to what an economist would refer to as rational discrimination as opposed to that earlier irrational or taste discrimination for the money that an employer is paying out women do less work or as in fact these things pan out those who are less productive at work receive less pay yes its structural discrimination too but its discrimination of a type that we actually desire those whose work is more valuable to an employer get paid more this is the very basis of a market system and it is impossible for one to operate without such discrimination harman also said parttime women receive less pay than fulltime men do you think that thats because they are less intelligent less committed less hardworking less qualified its not the case women less intelligent than men no no one is still spouting that lie are parttime workers less committed than full time yes by a certain measurable number of hours a week actually theyve decided not to commit to fulltime work in favour of things more important to them in this life similarly with the hardworking part we can measure the number of hours that they are working less hard yes parttime workers do tend to be less qualified in the way that employers value qualification the women at work commission makes a useful observation about why all parttime workers both men and women make less per hour than their fulltime brothers and sisters because it costs more to hire parttimers youve got to pay for two sets of training two sets of management two sets of perks and yes parttime workers are less productive per hour as well im all for continuing to wipe out direct or taste discrimination on the basis of haplotype but im not in favour of this attempt to wipe out structural discrimination thats something that well not only never get

its joe bloggs was made redundant a year ago he has been out of work for eight months after much effort hes in the running for a job in which his rivals are a woman and a bangladeshi male his wouldbe employers tell him regretfully that although hes the right man for the job its going to the woman why because new equality legislation encourages such positive discrimination and the company has extensive contracts with government joe is outraged how can such blatant social injustice come under the banner of equality he has the backing of a large swath of public opinion in the now defunct equal opportunities commission eoc published a small scale survey less than three dozen people called talking equality from a commercial thinktank the future foundation the survey reflected the findings of the eocs own more extensive research a significant proportion of the british public believe that women receive low pay and perform a larger domestic role through choice not discrimination inequality is the result of natural differences between the sexes the findings said that equality is the concern of only a small minority of highflying females furthermore in spite of countless personal experiences of discrimination women do not see it as a major issue they regard it as a private problem with which they put up and shut up all of which means that the government has to conduct more than a couple of radio interviews if it wants to explain how and why its new and very timid equality bill is important not just for women and ethnic minorities but also for the future of joe bloggs and his children under the legislation gender pay audits will be compulsory for councils public bodies and firms which provide services for public bodies whats already known is that a woman in full time work earns p for every earned by a man if she is a graduate by the time she is without children her pay cheque will already be smaller than a man in an equivalent job if she works part time she will earn p for every earned by a man in fulltime work under the new law employers can give preferential treatment to women and ethnic minorities if equally qualified without the risk of being sued the equality bill will also outlaw age discrimination in the daily mail katja hall of the confederation of british industry says pay gaps are not the result of discrimination they are because many women prefer to work in the human resources department than the finance department or they that they prefer parttime work choice is a deceptive in this context female choice in the workplace often proceeds as follows given my priorities namely children perhaps an elderly dependent possibly a partner working long hours and inadequate or too expensive childcare what can i take thats on offer in the labour market the answer very often is one two or even three parttime jobs that underuse talent offer no career structure and pay badly but do allow you to pick kids up from school and control your hours is that a fair tradeoff critics of the new legislation argue that women are ahead academically and pouring into the professions but while they may react more quickly than their male counterparts to the starting gun once they are in the race they carry handicaps that allow the men to sprint ahead women are paid poorly because they often work in the lowlyvalued caring industry for example in residential homes they take time out to have babies and see a reduction of around in their income when they return they dont like careers fashioned in a style that suits alpha males with a wife at home mens choices also need to be opened up why should they receive only two weeks paternity pay compared with weeks for the mother why should they pay a career penalty for requesting flexible hours if they have a young child even paying them more than women means that working parttime or fewer hours is deemed unaffordable as for choosing women and ethnic minorities before men thats not fair and it hasnt been fair for the decades that men have had priority over other groups in society what this story is really about is a huge lost opportunity and the failure of both men and women to recognise a common enemy the voracious demands of the labour market the lost opportunity was back in the s when it was clear that society needed to be redesigned if talent was to be utilised and family and community life nourished in the us class actions meant that major corporations were taken to court not on behalf of one woman as here but for all women quotas were introduced that did prove successful in pushing women up the ladder faster but look at the us today women are in the workplace but the workplace is unchanged men and women work longer harder and with even less time to see one another and rear children its equality of the kind we shouldnt desire the cost is a human one but not to the bosses canada in contrast has had a much more farsighted approach to using the drive for equality as a means not of equalising misery but bringing social change since the s it has had a charter of rights and freedoms it rejects the notion that the aim is treating women the same as men formal equality it advocates that the disadvantaged require different treatment substantive equality canadian law isnt interested in the intentions of those who discriminate but it is concerned with the effects of their actions the aim is not punishment but improvement not for the individual but for the group of which she or he is a part in one case for instance women held less than of bluecollar jobs in canadian national railways the courts ordered cnr to make changes to recruitment and establish a quota system the supreme court argued that a critical mass in the workforce was essential to provide a significant chance for the continuing self correction of the system or to put it another way the more women in positions of influence perhaps the stronger the chance that parttime work wont mean the loss of a career that long hours arent always essential that family demands become more visible and companies begin to look more like the markets they are trying to reach alpha females just like alpha males will always insist on rising with the dawn chorus working hour days and hiring an army of concierges to live their lives by proxy hosting little amys birthday party choosing the wallpaper and walking the dog but for the rest of us something has to change todays front page headline in the daily mail reads women to be more equal than men it doesnt make sense and it will never be true but it strikes at a primitive and divisive fear in both men and women that this path is leading to the emasculation of men and the forfeiture of what some women regard as their femaleness explaining why this is not the case is complicated and opponents have a much easier and evocative narrative to sell in the end nobody wants a society in which men and women are forced to surrender the terrain that marks their differences so politicians have to turn the page instead of discussing these modest changes in terms of minority rights however valid they need to paint a picture of a society that uses all our talents in a variety ways allowing family life and the relationships that matter to take prominence over paid work government has to restore meaning to the word choice for fathers and mothers for some men that may mean a period of adjustment which might hurt but it will hurt less if they can see it not as women winning but as a long term gain both for themselves and those they

harriet harmans plans for an equality bill were broadly welcomed today although the conservatives and employers questioned whether some of her specific proposals would work for the conservative party theresa may said she welcomed the plan to consolidate existing equalities legislation into one bill she criticised some of the details she said she was not sure how the proposals to tackle age discrimination in the provision of goods and services would work in practice and she said the government should concentrate on improving the pay gap in whitehall before targeting the private sector but she said the tories were committed to creating a fair and equal society and that they would work constructively with the government on the legislation but when harman made her statement in the commons backbench conservatives were more critical philip davies mp for shipley said how on earth can you justify in an equalities bill having something that allows people to be selected solely on their skin colour or gender that is completely and utterly outrageous brendan barber general secretary of the tuc described the proposed bill as a landmark piece of legislation which if implemented will help millions of people to reach their potential at work he said that the gender pay gap was in the private sector but only in the public sector using procurement to promote equality should have a major impact on promoting equality in the private sector barber said the cbis deputy directorgeneral john cridland said the cbi was in favour of the government working with employers to find ways of getting applicants from underrepresented groups into jobs but he criticised the proposals to get firms bidding for government contracts to publish equal pay audits this would be pointless and it would do nothing to improve equality in the workplace he also said the cbi was sceptical about whether it would be possible to produce workable legislation to outlaw age discrimination in the provision of goods and services stephen robertson director of the british retail consortium welcomed the governments decision not to accept union demands for all employers to carry out full equal pay audits pat healy vice president of the national pensioners convention said having equality on paper is a major step towards tackling age discrimination in society but putting that into practice is going to be much harder to achieve when the cabinet has a proportion of older people serving in it and pensioners are given proper economic power through a basic state pension then well know that ageism has really been consigned to the dustbin of history,2008-06,harriet harmans plan equality bill broadly welcomed today although conservative employer questioned whether specific proposal would work

the government has announced a new equality bill aimed at tackling entrenched discrimination in the workplace and beyond the bill replaces more than separate pieces of legislation covering race disability and gender equality what will it do for women although the gap between women and mens fulltime pay has fallen from in to now the government claims that unless action is taken it will take until to close the gender gap entirely the government says transparency is essential in tackling discrimination so it is banning secrecy clauses in contracts that prevent employees from talking about how much they earn this does not mean that people will be required to disclose their pay details but they can compare pay and benefits if they so choose it is also investigating the effectiveness of pay audits as a tool to close the gender pay gap although it has dropped plans to make these compulsory in the short term as part of the push for equal pay the equality and human rights commission will be launching inquiries into sectors where the gender pay gap is particularly wide including the financial sector where men earn more than their female colleagues what about positive discrimination the governments white paper says that employers will be able to take into account the makeup of their workforce when choosing between two equally qualified candidates if a particular group is underrepresented the employer can take this into account when deciding who to employ they will also be able to fasttrack or select recruits from underrepresented groups as long as they are equally suitable but they will not be allowed to promote people purely on the basis of their race or gender what about age discrimination the number of people aged over is set to double in the next years but at the moment it is quite legal for older people to be excluded from certain services or charged more simply because of their date of birth the bill outlaws age discrimination in the provision of goods and services covering everything from nhs treatment to financial services companies will no longer be able to turn down someones application for a credit card or insurance policy simply because of their age currently some insurers refuse to offer travel insurance to older consumers and some lenders have maximum age limits for mortgage customers however some things will be exempt from the rules perks such as free travel or priority flu jabs for pensioners will still be allowed and financial services companies will still be able to charge older customers more for things like insurance if there is a justifiable reason for doing so for example if they are more likely to make a claim arent there already age discrimination laws there are rules to protect people from age discrimination in the workplace the laws which were introduced in october force employers to make sure all workers have the same rights in terms of training and promotion regardless of their age they outlaw direct discrimination such as advertising for people below a certain age and indirect discrimination whereby a companys working practices have a disadvantageous effect on employees of a certain age what else is in the bill the government is considering allowing people to claim that they have been discriminated against for more than one reason at the moment you can only claim you have been treated unfairly over one characteristic for example because of your race or gender not both the government will look into the potential benefits of changing this rule it will also look into allowing trade unions and other bodies representing workers to take discrimination claims to court on behalf of a group of individuals,2008-06,government ha announced new equality bill aimed tackling

more openness about what we earn could lead to greater equality of pay there is a great deal of crossness this morning at harriet harmans equality legislation and the idea that employers might give preferential treatment to female or ethnic minority job applicants the daily mail is so angry its a wonder the paper doesnt actually combust into a smouldering pile of fury as you read it theres so much tetchiness over the possibility of positive discrimination that the other half of the story that public sector firms and private firms with publicsector contracts are going to have to reveal the salary gap between male and female employees is in danger of being overlooked which is a shame because british workers could do with a bit of focus when it comes to discussing pay put bluntly we dont do it its considered a bit crass do you know what the people sitting either side of you earn youll be in a minority if you do its not considered good office form to demand others share the figures on their pay slip in fact according to a report in the ft this morning one in four employers prevent staff from discussing pay with gagging clauses not given our general reticence on the matter that youd think theyd need them but really why shouldnt we ask your employer wont be keen of course but isnt that exactly the point it might be in their interest for you to all shut up and hope blindly that youre being paid the right amount for the job but its no good at all for the employees which would be most of us of course so go on ask the question find out how much your employer thinks youre worth in relation to your employees it might be motivating totally dispiriting or enough to make you go and work elsewhere others will say those are exactly the reasons for not doing it but actually wouldnt you rather know than just blindly slaving away,2008-06,openness earn could lead greater equality pay great deal crossness morning harriet harmans equality legislation idea employer might give preferential treatment female ethnic minority job applicant daily mail angry wonder paper doesnt actually combust smouldering pile fury read much tetchiness possibility positive discrimination half story public sector firm private firm publicsector contract going reveal salary gap male female employee danger overlooked shame british worker could bit focus come discussing pay put bluntly dont considered bit crass know people sitting either side earn youll minority considered good office form demand others share figure pay slip fact according report ft morning one four employer prevent staff discussing pay gagging clause given general reticence matter youd think theyd need really shouldnt ask employer wont keen course isnt exactly point might interest shut hope blindly youre paid right amount job good employee would u course go ask question find much employer think youre worth relation employee might motivating totally dispiriting enough make go work elsewhere others say exactly reason actually wouldnt rather know blindly slaving away,"['openness', 'earn', 'could', 'lead', 'greater', 'equality', 'pay', 'great', 'deal', 'crossness', 'morning', 'harriet', 'harmans', 'equality', 'legislation', 'idea', 'employer', 'might', 'give', 'preferential', 'treatment', 'female', 'ethnic', 'minority', 'job', 'applicant', 'daily', 'mail', 'angry', 'wonder', 'paper', 'doesnt', 'actually', 'combust', 'smouldering', 'pile', 'fury', 'read', 'much', 'tetchiness', 'possibility', 'positive', 'discrimination', 'half', 'story', 'public', 'sector', 'firm', 'private', 'firm', 'publicsector', 'contract', 'going', 'reveal', 'salary', 'gap', 'male', 'female', 'employee', 'danger', 'overlooked', 'shame', 'british', 'worker', 'could', 'bit', 'focus', 'come', 'discussing', 'pay', 'put', 'bluntly', 'dont', 'considered', 'bit', 'crass', 'know', 'people', 'sitting', 'either', 'side', 'earn', 'youll', 'minority', 'considered', 'good', 'office', 'form', 'demand', 'others', 'share', 'figure', 'pay', 'slip', 'fact', 'according', 'report', 'ft', 'morning', 'one', 'four', 'employer', 'prevent', 'staff', 'discussing', 'pay', 'gagging', 'clause', 'given', 'general', 'reticence', 'matter', 'youd', 'think', 'theyd', 'need', 'really', 'shouldnt', 'ask', 'employer', 'wont', 'keen', 'course', 'isnt', 'exactly', 'point', 'might', 'interest', 'shut', 'hope', 'blindly', 'youre', 'paid', 'right', 'amount', 'job', 'good', 'employee', 'would', 'u', 'course', 'go', 'ask', 'question', 'find', 'much', 'employer', 'think', 'youre', 'worth', 'relation', 'employee', 'might', 'motivating', 'totally', 'dispiriting', 'enough', 'make', 'go', 'work', 'elsewhere', 'others', 'say', 'exactly', 'reason', 'actually', 'wouldnt', 'rather', 'know', 'blindly', 'slaving', 'away']",201
harriet harman said that plans being published today intended to make private companies demonstrate whether they pay male and female staff equally were designed to tackle entrenched discrimination in the workplace a bill to be unveiled in the queens speech later this year and piloted by harman labours deputy leader will require all public sector firms to publish figures showing the gender pay gap a requirement which will also be placed on firms with public sector contracts roughly of all private sector firms harman will also offer a template which private sector firms can use to publish the data although there will be no immediate statutory requirement on firms to do so ministers will consider secondary legislation at some point a white paper being published today will outline the plans which will also allow employers to give preferential treatment to female or ethnic minority job candidates and which will outlaw age discrimination in the provision of goods and services interviewed about her plans on bbc radio s today programme harman strongly rejected the idea that as one newspaper headline suggested she was trying to make women more equal than men women more equal than men chance would be a fine thing she said parttime women receive less pay than fulltime men do you think that thats because they are less intelligent less committed less hardworking less qualified its not the case under the plans public sector employers and private sector firms with public sector contracts will be expected to publish the percentage difference in the average pay of men and women in the company but not the actual amount although other private firms will not initially be compelled to publish the figures harman said she thought the new regime would challenge the secrecy culture surrounding pay firms that did not publish the figures would look as if they had something to hide she went on we have structural discrimination on pay we will be able to see it clearly for the first time workplace by workplace and then women will be able see that they are paid less than men and they will be able to complain about it and challenge it harman said that her plans would not force employers to discriminate against men but she said that where candidates were equally qualified it would allow employers to hire female or ethnic minority candidates without fear of being sued for discrimination she said the government needed to legislate because the law on this subject was currently not clear the new rules would be permissive she pointed out labour had used this kind of positive discrimination to bring about a dramatic increase in the number of women in parliament and she said the new rules would help police forces trying to recruit more black or asian officers the white paper will also outlaw discrimination in goods and services on the basis of age a measure likely to cost the department of health billions of pounds if it is to fulfil a new duty to end discrimination on the basis of age in healthcare the department will publish research today revealing the scale of discrimination in the provision of health alongside an estimate of the cost of ending it a government source said age discrimination is the last major frontier whereby it is all right to say sorry you are past it so i am not going to provide you with insurance or health services

i cant tell people what is happening at home a new report by the nspcc draws long overdue attention to the plight of south asian children not just as victims of violence but as witnesses it highlights the cultural context isolation fear of racism language barriers uncertain immigration status cultural and religious pressures to keep the marriage going which means that asian women on average take years to leave a violent relationship thus exposing their children to substantial psychological and physical damage once a woman makes that leap what awaits her are underfunded overcrowded asian womens refuges what might stop her accessing even these services are nervous social workers police officers and teachers who are hindered by political correctness says the nspcc from intervening in asian cultural practices this is not new it is not so much political correctness but the ideology of multiculturalism that has given rise to this situation tolerance of cultural practices by state agencies has been going on since at least the s black feminists have campaigned hard against this aspect of multiculturalism which has given unelected community leaders autonomy in the domestic cultural and religious affairs of the community for a mainstream organisation like the nspcc to lend its weight to the issue adds impetus to the critique as a result of campaigning and the victoria climbi case there have been substantial shifts in policy guidelines based on the underlying principle that multicultural sensitivity is not an excuse for moral blindness were drawn up by the government to enable schools and other agencies to deal sensitively with issues like forced marriage the report rightly identifies this as a concern for asian women and girls as implementation has been patchy the government has finally agreed to put these guidelines on a statutory basis in the autumn that will allow ngos to hold state agencies accountable although the uneven delivery of services is still an issue the fact that the nspcc has highlighted this as its big conclusion feels curiously outdated because the debate has changed multiculturalism came under attack in the cantle report in into the race riots in bradford and was further discredited in the wake of the bombings in the governments war against terror building cohesion has become the new holy grail within this policy construct singlegroup funding has fallen out of favour paradoxically the funding of muslim groups continues apace while secular groups are being hit specialist organisations catering for those vulnerable groups at the centre of the nspcc report are to have their funding cut southall black sisters struggle to replace the core funding under threat of withdrawal by ealing council is one of the most widely publicised examples of this the nspcc makes a welcome case for the continuing need for a specialist sector but fails to make the links it is this failure that takes the nspcc report into dangerous territory when it calls for the engagement of faith and community leaders in the fight against domestic violence it is precisely these leaders who act as gatekeepers to the community and cry racist when the state intervenes who account for the nervousness of state agencies the nspcc organised a conference aimed at the muslim community which was attended by imams it found unsurprisingly that for some imams the issue of domestic abuse is not on their radar perhaps the most telling statement of all was that many mosques are the premises of men only in the teeth of such entrenched patriarchal attitudes calling for the training of imams feels like trying to empty a lake with a teacup when the muslim parliament of great britain reported on the extent of child abuse in madrasas in little action was taken in this new political climate minority girls rights are again being sold down the river the political correctness the nspcc highlights is about to get worse commander steve allen of the metropolitan police at a recent conference on domestic violence said the governments agenda on terror is hampering police work on issues such as forced marriage because the government is keen not to alienate those same leaders in the fight against extremism perhaps we need the kind of research that demonstrates how children exposed to violence develop a tendency to extremism as adults

its not often a window is opened into the lives of couples who try to be truly equal recently the new york times sunday magazine featured a cover story on mothers and fathers who share parenting and household duties equally in which there are no mommy jobs and no daddy jobs mommy has to put kids before career and so does daddy the author lisa belkin described these parents founding principles they would create their own model one in which they were parenting partners equals and peers neither would be the keeper of the mental todo lists neither of their careers would take precedence when it comes to marriage the more things change the less things change in a society where mothers who work fulltime still do twice the amount of housework and even more childcare hours as working fathers the idea that dad would give up his career advancement to cook with the kids is pretty radical when we define equality for adult women and men we usually use breadwinning as the key indicator at home meanwhile this mother puts it best when she says someone has to be in charge that someone is usually mom a fact that hasnt changed in decades look we say a mother can work too and keep bringing home the bacon even though shes also staying up late to clean the house and take care of the children thats not equality thats taking on an extra job these social norms change slowly but we see more examples each day and now in barack and michelle obama we have a fantastic opportunity for american leaders to model change as psychologists say michelle has told us barack forgets to pick up his socks but most of their communication both verbal and nonverbal even the famous fist jab signals he and michelle are equal partners starting now i hope they show us how for many myself included to be frank its challenging to see men in these nurturing roles it goes against so many of our cultural norms we need leaders to model new norms for us amy vachon a shared care parent featured in the new york times article states that the philosophy of being teammates is more important than how tasks break down and though his career clearly hasnt suffered the obamas with their international stage can offer insight into how to manage an equal partnership its successes and failures while much is made of obamas new masculinity a nonmartial viewpoint his sensitivity and gestalt openly informed by a matriarchy this is not a person who worked parttime so he could plan sashas play dates and clean the house but nor is michelle who was the breadwinner for many years the obamas have offered us a rare frank snapshot of their relationship but i want to know more i would love to know how these two superachievers did it because right now i see michelle holding the lions share of the household duties and that is equality version not michelle has gotten a lot of flak for describing her husband but i recognize this loving selfdeprecation as banter between equals imagine if hillary clinton had had the guts to rib bill a little back in defending her comments about baracks difficulty picking up after himself michelle said in an interview in glamour magazine people understood that this is how we all live in our marriages and barack is very much human so lets not deify him because what we do is we deify and then were ready to chop it down yes lets not deify the great man but lets also not deify the ideal of the milllennial mom she who has cut back her schedule but remains high powered attends mommy and me yoga and uses her professional skills to run the house like a corporation michelle obamas comments can verge on this and while it rings too true for many women its not where we need to be in iowa this winter michelle told audiences her husband is snorey and stinky in the morning doesnt put the butter back in the fridge and one morning put on his clothes and left while she juggled her own schedule to deal with an overflowing toilet writing in the wall street journal monica langley noted that michelle obama expects a lot of every family member from having her six and nineyearold daughters set their own alarm clocks to insisting her husband pick up his dirty socks obama has spoken of the importance of fathers and his own pain that his own father opted out of his life he speaks of the importance of being a truly present father attentive sensitive and engaged nicely said barack but i would like to hear how you helped michelle maintain her career i want details did you compromise anything did you ever miss a critical meeting come home from the legislature in springfield and stay up late doing something around the house michelle has spoken of her struggles when obama served in the illinois state senate and one gets the sense she shouldered almost all the parenting burden while maintaining a very fulltime job what a role model the obamas could be to the millions of couples out there trying to figure out how to maintain a true partnership when the kids come along and compromises must be made if barack is a new kind of man as pundits are fond of saying perhaps he can show us hes a new kind of husband as well,2008-06,often window opened life

something happened last week that few papers reported on and which few of us would really grasp as significant in any way the un security council unanimously adopted resolution which said that sexual violence in conflict zones is a matter of international peace and security so what rape has always happened in war since time immemorial hasnt it our history books are littered with phrases such as the spoils of war or rape and pillage as though rape is a normal byproduct of any conflict a female interviewee involved in amnesty international research in sudan said janjawid militia and government soldiers attacked a primary school for girls raping the pupils they were aged between and because i told people what happened the authorities arrested me they said we will show you what rape is a teacher from gitega burundi interviewed for an amnesty international report said i was stopped by an officer of the government armed forces and taken to a military base in mubugua the soldier raped me and kept me with him all night this was just common practice i had a child from the rape and we have lots of difficulties to the extent that resolution was reported on at all it was hailed for recognising rape as a war crime but rape already was a war crime it was just we never took it seriously or treated it as such even in the customary laws of war the geneva conventions of and a host of other human rights treaties rape was at least implicitly recognised as a human rights abuse a grave breach and in some circumstances a war crime the rome statute a result of much womens activism and the tribunals of rwanda and yugoslavia achieved prosecutions for rape as a war crime then came resolution in that was meant to put women at the heart of the peace and reconstruction processes indeed resolutions and now bear many similarities so what is new about resolution resolution doesnt just say rape is a bad thing it says that crimes of sexual violence committed during conflict particularly those committed systematically as a weapon or tactic of war to terrorise humiliate and wipe out or forcibly relocate whole communities prolongs deepens and promotes conflict such crimes especially if they are not addressed or punished linger in the minds structure and makeup of whole communities the systemic use of rape on communities emotionally physically and financially damages both the individuals and these communities for years to come they feed anger vengeance and distrust and so fuel continued cycles of conflict displacement and refugee flows the resolution makes a direct link between such crimes of sexual violence and conflicts that may rumble on for years or erupt again years later that is to say the use of rape and sexual violence as weapon of war is a matter of national and international security and must be factored into the planning decisions and strategies of international peace and security its a political issue as well to those of us working in this area there is nothing new in this analysis indeed the historical tendency to separate crimes of violence against women into private behaviour as though it had no political or public dimension has always been ludicrously shortsighted and indeed discriminatory we are still struggling to make the world understand violence against women as a political issue of equality development security and stability this resolution is unique in helping us to make that stand victories for womens human rights campaigners are not thick on the ground they should be celebrated so while we will continue to see such abuses and lament them we must applaud this resolution which strengthens our hand but as ever there is more to do to have these resolutions translated into action,2008-06,something happened last week paper

we had been married for less than an hour and my wife was already asking me for a divorce we shouldnt have done that got married youre probably right but we dont need a divorce theres another thing we can have a different thing well get one of those you mean an annulment my wife was right i did mean an annulment but i couldnt think of the word because i was drunk we were sitting in a bus shelter opposite a hollywood wedding chapel in an area on the seedier side of las vegas passing a bottle of jack daniels between us first in celebration then in desperation to the passerby we looked seriously in need of an annulment well blame it on the drink i said people will understand of course people didnt actually know we were getting married in the first place most didnt even know we were a couple in the space of a month we had met fallen in love got drunk stayed drunk and eloped one minute we were slumped in a pub in london the next we were slumped in a bus shelter in vegas talking about a divorce sorry an annulment i had never seen myself as the marrying type much of my late teenage years and early s was spent in a ramshackle fashion i was either dropping in and out of college or lurching from one lowgrade job to a lesser one in some sort of anticareer move as my s progressed my appetite for any sort of career declined i moved to spain where i worked in bars loafed around reading books and played chess i was happy to be more or less single and determined to stay that way my lifestyle already mimicked that of a retiree and i was pretty much happy i used to have an idea in my head that this is how cliff richard would have lived if he hadnt been able to sing and if he had tendencies towards alcoholism still things changed out of nowhere i got the opportunity to write a book writing for a living had always been an ambition of mine albeit one that had never been realised due to a lack of talent and an everevaporating sense of discipline but here was my chance a friend had put me in contact with a countess in italy who wanted someone to pen her memoirs in return for accommodation board and a slice of the potential profits emails and phone calls somehow convinced her of my credentials and ability and i was to fly to rome to spend several months recording her story and writing about her in the meantime i was to go to london to drum up support from my contacts in the publishing industry of which i had none and prepare for writing the book of which i was incapable love in the form of celia got in the way she was a friend and colleague of my brother they had done their phds at the same university and the first time we met in a pub in london i fell for her immediately and completely she was smart as a whip funny pretty and kind for the first time i felt comfortable being with someone and being me rather than either an exaggerated or dampened down version of me for a month we had a straightoutofthemovies love affair looking back it seems that every day during that beginning bit of the summer was sunny that every stranger doffed their cap as i passed that every time i looked in the mirror my smiling face looked back at me of course all thats probably rubbish the first stages of love are often full of horror and uncertainty and i variously felt scared and guilty scared because she was a doctor and i was a tramp and guilty because she had just come out of a fiveyear relationship and i was a newly found really terrible biographer who may have been taking advantage of her there was a lot of sneaking around that month and a lot of emotion and it all became too much we split up then got back together again then split up then between us we decided it would be a good idea to get married the idea sprang out of nowhere one evening in the pub neither of us had ever fancied a traditional wedding and we thought if we did it where no one could see then if things didnt work out it could be our secret we booked flights and a hotel and then without either our bags or our minds got on an airplane from what ive heard our experience of vegas differed from most peoples for a start there was very little whooping i cant remember either of us giving anyone a high five we were fairly subdued the bright lights didnt exactly set our souls on fire flying across the world to marry someone is all very well as an idea in a pub to actually be in that talked about place in the flesh ready to do the thing after four weeks of knowing each other is an altogether different prospect what the hell did we think we were doing and who the hell did we think we were we shouldnt do this would be our mantra for one hour yes we should would be our mantra for the next in the end we did i bought a threepack of white tshirts for myself and a white dress for my wifetobe we looked at wedding chapels and decided on a hollywood wedding chapel because it was one of the first listed in the phone book and because the whole thing could be done for about the day we got married was hot and we spent it doing the two things that had become customary during our relationship drinking and soul searching our chapel was opposite a rundown bar where we chatted with the toothless locals and bought them all shots it got to about seven oclock lets go and get married said celia the actual service lasted about three minutes and except for the vicar and one of the staff there was no one to witness it back on the street it was just us with the jack daniels and talk of annulments a shade less than an hour after being pronounced man and wife perhaps the story should end there dont get married to a virtual stranger could be the message it will ruin your life but it didnt we came back to london and gradually family and friends found out we were treated to weeks of astonishment anger confusion and congratulations some more genuine than others i hope you know what youre doing was a phrase we heard more than once the thing was did we know what we were doing what exactly were we playing at gradually the novelty of being newly married gave way to grim reality i felt like i was wrong in everything the way i behaved the way i thought it was unfair on my family not to have told them it was unfair on celia that she had married such a waster it was unfair to my loner sensibilities that i had entered into a lifelong commitment that winter in london i underwent the biggest comedown imaginable i was poor unemployable and married to a doctor i had no career history no qualifications and i felt in her shadow i spent many sleepless nights wondering what i was going to do the whole thing felt insane i had two choices to run away like i had done from every other bad situation in my life or stay and fight for my marriage i surprised myself and plumped for the latter now some two years later we are still married its been a slog financially and emotionally but in the main a very happy one ive realised that theres a reason why people get to know each other first and then plan to get married weve had to do it the other way around getting to know each other and going through the teething process of an early relationship after we had already made that commitment but we made it through and somehow ive managed to forge a career as a journalist thanks to unwavering support kindness and belief from my wife when i was at my lowest ebb to be able to start the day without a pint a panic attack or a bout of selfloathing has been a revelation ive realised that my ambition to make a living as a writer has always been there but i was happy to cover it up by taking on menial work drinking myself to sleep every night and pretending i was happy i honestly cant thank her enough both for helping me turn my life around and showing me what love really is even when she barely knew me it will take the rest of my life to begin to pay her back what we had a couple of years ago was a wedding what we have now is a marriage i suppose the world is littered with stories of people who have married on a whim and lived to regret it you could say that we were selfish and irresponsible at the time and the fact that our marriage has not only survived but also flourished is something of a fluke i dont like that argument i think we got married and stayed married because on some level we knew we were just about right for each other we were in love if i could have my time over again i wouldnt change a thing despite what was said during that sad desperate hour in the bus shelter i hope i think my wife feels the same way viva

while the headlines about todays home affairs select committees reporthave inevitably focused on issues of forced marriage and honour violence it is perhaps easy to forget that two women in the uk are killed every week yes every week by their partner or former partner regardless of their class or religion calls by the allparty committee for compulsory lessons to teach children that all forms of domestic violence are wrong have to be welcomed education is important to prevent future generations of men thinking it is acceptable to hit their wives and girlfriends and women colluding in the

lessons about honourbased violence and forced marriage should be an explicit statutory requirement in british schools and become a compulsory part of the sex and relationships curriculum mps said today a report from the allparty home affairs select committee said education on these issues seemed to be at best variable and at worst nonexistent with some schools apparently resistant to discussing them owing to fear of offending parents and communities it said there was evidence to suggest that children were in danger of being removed from school or further education and forced into marriage the committee acknowledged the significant steps taken to stop domestic and honourbased violence however it criticised the governments disproportionate focus on the criminal justice system committee chairman keith vaz said we are still failing victims in different ways through a shortage of refuge space through the ignorance or disbelief of professionals or by allowing the continued abuse of some of those forced into marriage by granting visas to their spouses there needed to be a shift in focus towards education prevention and early intervention he added we educate our young people about the dangers of drugs or road safety but not it seems about domestic and honourbased violence and forced marriage which will affect a quarter of all women in their lifetime and many men too posters and other publicity material should be sent out to schools by the department for children schools and families rather than waiting for a specific request from teachers the report said the mps also suggested there should be a wideranging public education campaign about all the issues involved in domestic violence along the lines of a road safety campaign and that doctors and nurses should undergo training in identifying victims of domestic violence other recommendations include a specialised victim protection programme similar to witness protection for women fleeing honourbased violence and refusing visa applications in the case of reluctant brides or bridegrooms domestic violence cost the uk bn in in terms of expenses incurred on public services losses to the economy and costs to the victim the report said with the true cost likely to be much higher as not all crimes are reported to police yesterday saw the second in a series of national roadshows organised by the government to tackle honourbased violence the event in cambridge brought together police officials from the crown prosecution service and charities to raise awareness of the problem the home office minister vernon coaker described honourbased violence as a heinous crime that had no place in society i recognise the scale of the problem is largely unknown since so much of it remains underground these roadshows will help authorities identify the problem more readily helping some of the most vulnerable people in the country the governments forced marriage unit deals with inquiries and cases of forced marriage every year about a third of these concern unders and are men home office figures suggest there are about honour killings each year but the report says the total is likely to be far

some revolutions take longer to arrive than others several thousand years of assumptions about the rights of women were never going to disappear overnight as is illustrated by the glacially slow pace of progress of women in public life since womens suffrage was granted years ago some inequalities have taken longer to tackle than others violence against women particularly at home has been all the more difficult to tackle societys unspoken assumption that the victim must be in some way to blame is taking time to shake off hard to detect and harder to escape from whether it is in the form of coercion into marriage or a drunken beating by a violent partner professionals are slow to uncover it less than one complaint in ends in conviction its sheer invisibility is part of the problem worldwide more women between the ages of and die from domestic violence than any other cause even road accidents or cancer in britain two women a week are killed by a partner or family member hundreds more experience some level of physical or emotional violence although celebrities such as gordon and tana ramsay have run the london marathon to raise money for campaigning charities like womens aid public awareness of the nature and extent of it is still low that makes todays report from mps on the crossparty home affairs committee a milestone in the way domestic violence is approached taking a broad sweep it has produced a compendium that assesses the progress of the past decade and charts a way forward for the next one this should be challenging reading for a government that prides itself on what has been done since it highlights the problems of leaving service provision to cashstrapped local councils with dozens of different priorities and a reluctance to tackle a subject that can be a cultural nightmare the result is an uneven and often inadequate range of services and a chronic shortage of places in refuges and of the specialist workers who support the women and children in them most specialist childrens workers are not sponsored by public funds at all while the mps report singles out the fate of one of the leading specialist providers southall black sisters which hangs in the balance because its local authority has withdrawn funding meanwhile visas are still granted to men who have made forced marriages to young british women and uncertain numbers of girls disappear from schools every week possibly in retaliation for refusing to obey their parents yet schools have no obligation to pursue them or register their fate what is needed now is a set of national

its not a good idea to date your leading men but sometimes its hard not to i got that out of the way with my first film where i had affairs with jeff bridges and peter bogdanovich its a risk elvis presley as a lover was indescribable it was and all the guys wore cheap cologne apart from him he smelled soapy and sweet like sugar and sweat i felt a lot for him i knew about his drug addiction i knew his tragic side and i wish i could have been a better friend to him but there was a sort of alchemy going on at the time i thought he was too old for me the beatles were my music but there was this chemistry between us today i dont want any useless drama or needless suffering in my life thats my main goal i have a number of men im seeing now one of the great things about having been through menopause is that your libido lessens a lot of women get worried by this but i find it very liberating it used to be that when you met someone you needed to have sex as soon as possible because by the time you got to know them you probably wouldnt want to i used to do that and im thinking about starting it again i was born and bred to be a great flirt im southern its in my blood we dont take it too seriously down south its a form of social relating that doesnt have anything to do with sex which makes it dangerous when you travel my first crush was on a lifeguard at the countryclub pool in memphis tennessee i loved to swim and i grew to love wrestling the lifeguard too my father was a great athlete and made me feel like it was ok to play as rough as the boys i didnt have to be a wilting withering violet i could outrun every boy in the neighbourhood apart from one and he became my boyfriend probably because he was the only one i couldnt catch then i met a boy who i became madly

changing our terminology wont stop mass killings i know that but it might go some way toward more fully comprehending and better campaigning against some of the worst atrocities of our time just as genocide refers to a systematic killing of a race or ethnicity so gendercide refers to the systematic killing of a gender although amnesty international and other groups have been right to push for the term femicide to describe the murder of hundreds of women in ciudad jurez in mexico and guatemala city on the whole itd be more helpful to use the more neutral term gendercide to help raise awareness of the issue as evidently the victims are not always women one such case is srebrenica the subject of renewed analysis although it shouldnt take a news story to remind us of it after the capture of karadzic last week it is widely acknowledged that the killing of bosnian men and boys was part of a policy to kill as many noncombatant males as possible in order to reduce the pool of possible enemy soldiers recognising that this was a gendercide is completely compatible with recognising that it was a genocide a fact which has been long established the victims of srebrenica and similar massacres ordered by karadzic were targeted because of their ethnicity but they were also targeted because of their gender to refer to srebrenica as a gendercide doesnt imply that one genders suffering in a war was somehow more important than the other side linda grants recent piece on rape as a weapon of war in bosnia is a reminder of how women were brutally targeted throughout the conflict but when a rape occurs during peacetime we tend to think of it as a violent misogynistic act when a rape occurs during war time we tend to think of it as a violent racist act an atrocity motivated by the ethnicity of the victim we need to start recognising that war is gendered in reality that in this arena women are not raped solely for being women or solely for their ethnicity but for the combination of the two for me feminism has always been about how rigid gender roles harm everyone albeit primarily women and during a war rigid gender roles like rigid ethnic stereotypes lead to a differentiated targeting of civilians one counterargument i anticipate in reply to this is that as gendercide is a less potent phrase than genocide in part by virtue of it still being largely unknown using it may seem to belittle the genocide committed in bosnia but no one is arguing that gender is the main reason for the mass murders in most cases although it does seem to be the primary element in the gendercides of ciudad jurez and guatemala city it was however an element of the mass killings in bosnia and we ignore it at our peril as a whole we have little framework for the concept of intersecting discriminations and until we can formulate a succinct way of expressing the multidimensional nature of oppression to refer to srebrenica as a genocide and a gendercide may be the best way we can convey the various aspects that were at work rather than belittling mass killings moreover using the phrase gendercide in other contexts has the opposite effect it becomes an important way to convey the true scale and nature of genderbased murders which are otherwise often dismissed as a conglomerate of discrete phenomena the product of a few bad eggs until we routinely conceptualise the murders of women in guatemala city and ciudad jurez as gendercides as killings directed specifically against one section of a population the tragedies will continue to be dismissed as essentially random acts its hard to account for the shocking police impunity to the murders in jurez but it seems that the mexican polices position is essentially that a few men happen to kill some women and thats all very sad but not something society as a whole should feel responsible for or be concerned about the evocation of the word genocide in the word gendercide the implication that like genocide it is a crime against humanity for which there are no excuses would also counter the deadend cultural relativism that feminists have to deal with from across the spectrum whenever they speak out against genderbased violence one of the things that is so frustrating about cultural relativism is not its central philosophical tenet so much as the fact it is used so inconsistently by its proponents no one i hope ever says of apartheid south africa well that was just their culture who are we to judge the systematic oppression of a whole race is not a legitimate part of anyones culture but the systematic oppression of a gender whenever i raise the topic of countries whose treatment of women could largely be termed a gender apartheid the response in liberal circles is well thats their culture lets not be imperialist as though apartheid was a temporal historical act within the reach of our moral judgment whereas culture must be treated as an innate ahistorical phenomena which renders it impossible to judge why do gender roles get pushed into the playpen of culture beyond time and beyond criticism when ethnicity it is accepted is a constructed identity that changes over time defined and redefined and manipulated by ultranationalists like karadzic is the murder of female children in india and china more forgivable on the grounds of culture than the mass murder of ethnic groups surely unless youre prepared to stand up and admit yes i think it is worse to discriminate on the grounds of race than on gender then gendercide is as legitimate a phrase as genocide and we should be as ready to speak out against it as we are against racial or ethnicitybased violence as karadzic is finally brought to justice i hope we take into account all the dimensions of the mass killings he and mladic ordered so that we can finally begin to make sense of what happened in bosnia and prevent it from happening again,2008-07,changing terminology wont stop mass killing know might

when the womens domestic violence and abuse charity southall black sisters sbs was threatened with the loss of its core funding earlier this year its chairwoman pragna patel received letters from service users a third of the women patel says stated that they were suicidal and could not cope without the groups support while letters is a modest amount for mainstream charity it speaks volumes for a specialist black and minority ethnic bme group that provides services and support for women who often lack not only the literacy skills it takes to write a letter but also the freedom to walk to the post box to send it the predicament sbs found itself in was caused by the london borough of ealings threat to withdraw its annual grant to the charity after deciding last year to commission a boroughwide domestic violence service rather than a specialist one it appeared that the domestic and sexual violence charity had fallen victim to a shift in policy driven by last years governmentbacked commission on integration and cohesion cic report which suggested that singlegroup funding meaning grants from public bodies to for example womens groups and ethnic minorityled organisations were inimical to the principles of cohesion and should be the exception not the rule now however after two sbs service users brought about a judicial review of the councils decision patel is able to inform her service users that her group has won a reprieve ealing council effectively conceded defeat at the hearing this month by withdrawing from the case and agreeing to reconsider its commissioning of domestic violence services the outcome will be welcomed by many small specialist bme community groups and charities which have been concerned that the new cohesion agenda will squeeze key funding sources at the hearing lord justice moses was told that the council had failed to assess the adverse impact on bme women of its decision to replace a specialist service with a generic one louise whitfield the public law project solicitor who represented sbs successfully argued that ealing failed to carry out a full and proper race equality impact assessment the move left no safety net for vulnerable women whose cases were made more complex by language difficulties and cultural pressures as well as immigration and asylum difficulties sbs receives inquiries a year from women in need mosess comments about the general cohesion agenda have potentially massive ramifications for local government and specialist third sector services and how the former funds the latter he said there is no dichotomy between funding specialist services and cohesion equality is necessary for cohesion to be achieved unprincipled approach patel describes the case as a key moment for the third sector she says were delighted with the outcome as if wed lost it would not only be a setback for our organisations but for others we felt that the councils approach was so unprincipled that we had no choice but to fight it kevin curley chief executive of the national association for voluntary and community action navca says the case has serious implications the judge linked the funding of specialised services with community cohesion he says here we have a judge saying that whereas the government has been suggesting for a long time that separate funding for blackled organisations will undermine cohesion and reinforces segregation if you do not publicly fund blackled groups then organisations retreat into themselves and have to spend a lot of time generating funding i think it is likely if they see socalled community facilities open to the whole community receiving public funding those will be whiteled organisations and it can breed resentment and segregation the sbs case has implications for local authorities whitfield adds it is important to make councils understand that there is more to cohesion than generic services and to understand that when they are meeting their duties under the race relations act they have got to listen to what users and groups have to say she stresses had we not had the case and there was not the strength of feeling and lobbying lots of councils would be saying we shouldnt fund single groups anymore and that is hugely problematic arjumand kazmi head of policy at bme third sector network group voice change england agrees that the case means there is even greater onus on councils to comply with race equality legislation especially in undertaking race equality impact assessments councils will need to make funding decisions based on evidenced need and not to make assumptions about communities needs in its defence ealing council says it never argued that community cohesion and integration were in conflict with specialist funding council leader jason stacey adds ealing council defended this case because it believes that all women in the borough regardless of their ethnic background should have equal access to domestic violence services this principle remains but the process has highlighted areas of the law that are unclear and open to many different interpretations stacey believes that the case will now give local authorities muchneeded guidance on grant aid funding and the council withdrew from the case on that basis we shall now be inviting the equality and human rights commission ehrc to assist us in refining our equality impact assessment process and this will benefit all councils he says ealing council also agreed to pay the costs of the charitys legal representation and those of the ehrc which supported the case sbs estimates the costs could be as much as the same amount as the annual grant however as well as forcing councils to rethink their approach to specialist funding and how they carry out their equalities assessments some observers believe that ultimately the government must rework the cic suggestions and guidelines on specialist group funding jess crocker local advocate with the national council for voluntary organisations compact advocacy programme says we welcome the outcome of this case as it provides legal backing for the many calls from the voluntary sector for government to revise its thinking on cohesion as the judge rightly points out specialist services can help communities to bond and councils must not shirk their duties to minority groups in the name of the cohesion agenda kazmi agrees we would like the department for communities and local government dclg in partnership with the office of the third sector and the bme third sector to produce an equality and cohesion guidance for funders explaining the clear evidenced links between inequality discrimination and disadvantage mixed messages for curley the governments lack of tight guidelines has given local authorities carte blanche to use singlegroup funding as an excuse to claw back the cash from specialist organisations he says if the government was asserting the fact that investing local government money in specialist blackled services was good for service users and cohesion and race relations then i think local authorities would tread very carefully before risking political flak in taking money away from proven and good quality services but if the government is giving mixed messages or suggesting that funding for black organisations undermines cohesion it arms them to go down a route they would otherwise have been wary of for its part the dclg says it is up to local authorities to determine how they allocate funding to specific groups or issues in their local area depending on local needs a spokesman adds we will of course review any judgments reached in this case to check whether they have any relevance the local government association lga meanwhile believes that it has already made clear that there are circumstances where singlegroup funding can help to promote cohesion all local authorities should have regard to equalities legislation and best practice when they review funding relationships with voluntary organisations says a spokesman the lga will consider any judgment made as a result of this case once it is available whitfield says that in the last six months she has been contacted by around different specialist organisations not just in relation to race some in relation to gender asking whether or not they can challenge their local council for cutting their funding because of the singlegroup funding policy the sbs case rather than bringing to an end the controversy has simply opened a new chapter in the longrunning debate on specialist funding this is going to go on whitfield warns this is the first skirmish and it will shake a lot of councils,2008-07,womens domestic violence abuse charity southall black sister sb wa threatened loss

vernon coaker junior home office minister responsible for police security and community safety is championing in parliament a campaign aimed at men against domestic and sexual violence the majority of men dont abuse women but there is a responsibility on men to speak up and speak out about it he says the noise that men have made about it in the past has never been loud enough i think thats a perspective i can bring to the whole discussion coaker is pushing forward the need to debate tricky issues such as rape sexual assault and male demand for prostitution and repeatedly emphasises how proud he is to be part of a process of engagement with citizens about a topic as emotiveas violence towards women i have always tried to be frank and upfront about things and to go out of my way to engage he says for me it is not about just maintaining the status quo but looking at effective ways to deal with the problems with a brief that includes serious and organised crime public order sex offences drugs animal extremism internet crime and football disorder to name a few reducing violence towards women is not his only commitment however his legacy is likely to be that he helped to make men accountable for rape and domestic violence and to change minds and attitudes as well as crime statistics and conviction rates this is about the sort of society and communities we want to live in coaker says it is about men challenging other mens behaviour although he has become wellrespected among womens organisations that deal with domestic and sexual violence there is nothing arrogant in his approach the womens movement has done a fantastic job foregrounding this work he says what i want to do is to continue making it mainstream recently coaker has been working alongside the mens coalition an organisation supported by counselling service relate the fatherhood institute and childrens charity nch which aims to get men speaking out on issues such as domestic violence rape and fatherhood the coalition has the potential to challenge the negative and often destructive culture that has such a detrimental effect on our families children and ultimately ourselves coaker says prostitution review tackling the controversial issue of prostitution is high on coakers agenda earlier this year he led a delegation to sweden and the netherlands accompanied by vera baird the solicitor general and barbara follett the parliamentary secretary for equality as part of a review on the demand side of prostitution while brothel prostitution has been legal in the netherlands since in sweden it is a criminal offence to buy or attempt to buy sexual services what impressed coaker about the swedish model was the broad consensus of citizens in supporting such a law so many of the people we spoke to in sweden were as concerned about the statement the law made about having a criminal offence to buy sex as they were about the practical outcomes he says it was the statement it makes about the sort of society its citizens want it to be in britain street prostitution particularly in the aftermath of the ipswich murders and the trafficking of women into brothels from overseas is generally viewed as abuse and coercion coaker believes but the sticking point is trying to get the public to think about the sex industry as an abusive industry but thanks to his and other ministers interventions the mood music is beginning to changeif the government had announced that it was doing a review of demand and was even considering criminalising the purchasing of sex two three years ago there would have been an outcry coaker says the fact that there was not a peep demonstrates just how far we have come flagging up abuse i recently heard coaker being affectionately referred to as the prostitution tsar does he mind he bursts into peels of laughter but it is obvious he is pleased that he is perhaps best known for his work in flagging up the abuse within the sex industry i havent heard that but i dont mind it at all says coaker adding that he recently met men and women involved in prostitution to consult them on what their experience of the industry can bring to the review what is interesting for coaker is the response he gets when speaking publicly about issues such as rape when traditionally women in parliament are put forward on such matters of course there are male victims of domestic violence and male victims of rape but by and large the majority of the victims are women and the perpetrators are males he says with rape coaker says we need to focus on the appalling situation where only of reported assaults make it to court the lowest ever once a rape case gets to court there is a chance of conviction which is not so bad he is concerned however that only a few hundred cases get to trial from more than reports to police again the key issue for coaker is public education you make the absolute assertion that rape is a criminal act one of the most heinous we know and there will be consequences it is about teaching respect and educating men to bring about attitudinal change it is a massive step forward to discuss these things now the challenge is how we move things forward what about coakers plans for the future while acknowledging the importance of legislation and the role of the criminal justice system his aim is to prevent crimes from occurring in the first instance coaker gives as an example a recent home office campaign seeking to educate men about the abuse inherent in the offstreet sex industry a poster put up in nightclubs mens toilets and sports venues aimed at men who are thinking of or who already do visit brothels bears the slogan walk in a punter walk out a rapist referring to the fact that trafficked women are forced into the sex industry and therefore cannot consent to sex we have been deliberately hardhitting he says you imagine using that slogan a couple of years ago there would have been uproar is coaker proud of his achievements so far it is a privilege to do this work he says i am not arrogant i know others have trumpeted this cause but what i am trying to do is to make a real difference out there this partnership of men and women taking a stand against rape and other forms of domestic and sexual violence can only be a good thing i hope it is only the start curriculum vitae age lives

whenever equal pay is mentioned the word complexity usually follows and todays ruling from the court of appeal underlines how complex resolving equal pay currently is the judge who heard the case himself declared that it was the most complicated employment issue ever to be heard by this court behind the seemingly dickensian workings of the legal system with courts overturning others rulings and the unions themselves in the dock is a human story of the women who have often borne high emotional and financial costs to have their cases heard for them the system is simply not working equal pay cases are taking too long and are too complex the result is that many women especially the low paid those not in a union those experiencing multiple difficulties or recently returned from maternity leave simply walk away from the situation and never press a claim and so the injustice gets perpetuated equal pay legislation is now nearly years old and is no longer fit for purpose the employment tribunal system is creaking under the weight of cases and no one has yet answered the question of who will foot the bill to resolve public sector cases and redress historical wrongs but the government has a onceinalifetime opportunity for reform harriet harman recently announced an equality bill which provides the government with the opportunity to take a fresh look at equal pay government ministers have been happy to denounce the pay gap as a national scandal but less willing to take bold measures to address it todays ruling yet again underlines the fact that now is the time for the government to be bold in protecting womens rights to fair pay this needs to be achieved through better protection for those experiencing pay injustice the fawcett society is calling for the government to simplify the law provide better assistance to those considering cases and ensure swift resolution is made to those cases coming to court but it is in everyones interest to prevent discrimination arising in the first place so that cases no longer need to come to court in the large numbers they do currently in other words we need prevention as well as cure to prevent pay inequality we are arguing for equal pay audits to be made compulsory as a health check for organisations to ensure they are paying fairly and staying within the law so far the governments proposals are heavily watered down public sector organisations and those parts of the private sector that provide goods or services to the state will be asked to publish their average pay gap but of private sector organisations will go unchecked perhaps todays ruling will provide the final impulse needed to make the government think more radically about equal pay and provide just solutions for all especially those women caught in endless court hearings,2008-07,whenever equal pay mentioned word complexity usually follows today ruling court appeal underline complex resolving equal pay currently

murder is an emotive topic the proposed shakeup of our current homicide laws the first in over years is bound to bring about polarised opinion but harriet harman minister for women deputy leader and the main player in parliament who has tirelessly campaigned to bring about these reforms is adamant that the new laws will save lives harman an uncompromising feminist has long considered the provocation defence which reduces murder to manslaughter to be pernicious as it is misused by some men who kill their female partners she is right currently provocation can be used as a partial defence in cases where there is a sudden loss of selfcontrol or temper this does not often apply to women who have been battered raped and abused by a male partner whom they then kill there are many in the criminal justice system who do not consider sustained violence towards women a good enough reason to kill and ask why didnt she leave him and the reality is that often such women cannot afford a sudden loss of control when their life is in danger and will wait until he is asleep or incapacitated before defending herself against future attack often a battered woman who kills her abuser is stuck with a defence of diminished responsibility whether or not she was suffering from an abnormality of mind at the time we could describe the anomaly as men lose their tempers women lose their marbles where provocation has often been successful is in cases where men argue that their honour has been besmirched for example if a man comes home and finds his wife in bed with another man or if she nags him constantly to take out the rubbish it is often considered reasonable by the courts that he strangles her and then maintains that he saw red and lost control of his actions this attitude is rooted in the ageold notion that married women are chattel and the provocation defence itself can be traced back at least to the th century but we are about to see the end of this defence of provocation which harman sees as an easy justification for killing in anger women who are suffering domestic violence kill in fear which is why a new defence of partial selfdefence will be open to them in the near future says harman this of course would apply to men who were genuinely the victims of sustained abuse by a partner but as harman puts it the reality is that although it is not a gendered defence of domestic homicides are committed by men and the victims are their female partners the infidelity clause or nagging and shagging defence is overwhelmingly used by men these reforms although a long time coming are along the right lines it is wrong to kill out of jealously or because someone insults you this is not serious provocation nor should it be an excuse for murder whereas battered women are often trapped in their situation with nowhere to run the victims of nagging and infidelity can simply leave the relationship without the fear of being tracked down and killed although there are those disappointed that the government did not go down the american route of replacing manslaughter with seconddegree murder it was right not to there should be a distinct crime of murder a crime in which no mitigating circumstances feature why should women such as the late emma humphreys the victim of horrendous abuse by the man she killed be labelled a murderer emma once told me that the stigma was almost as bad as the life sentence that came with it as for the provocation defence it is the end of the road lets hope that with the end of an excuse for men who kill for the

another chapter in the ongoing david and goliath struggle between southall black sisters sbs and ealing council came to a dramatic end recently when the council withdrew from the judicial review hearing at the high court in the middle of a two day hearing onethird of sbs funding has been provided by ealing since the s to provide domestic violence services to black and minority women last year ealing announced that it was going to use that same pot of money pa to provide a boroughwide service for all women facing domestic violence because it had identified gaps in provision most notably for white women a laudable aim if properly funded they embarked on this course of action without carrying out a race equality impact assessment eia on how their change of policy affect black and minority women which is a statutory obligation on legal advice users of sbs services started judicial review proceedings at the eleventh hour the council caved in delayed the tendering process carried out an impact assessment and as suspected came to the same conclusions as before but threw in an additional to deal with any possible negative impact at this point it became obvious that the council was not for turning sbs realised that it may never regain their financial support but that important principles were at stake which could benefit other specialist organisations locked in a similar struggle with their local authorities and decided to continue with legal proceedings the equality and human rights commission ehrc agreed that guidance was necessary and intervened as an interested third party thus lending the proceedings further gravitas the case sets a precedent especially in relation to the cohesion agenda and duties under the race relations legislation the councils actions amounted to policy based evidence gathering rather than evidencebased policy development the judge ruled that the council should have had due regard to its duties under the race relations act which means carrying out an eia before policy is changed and not after the event to buttress its case the judge also ruled that there was no dichotomy between cohesion and specialist services a very important clarification at a time when other councils are using this argument to cut their specialist services he argued like sbs had done that providing such services promoted equality and therefore cohesion this was in stark opposition to the councils position that single group funding reinforced segregation by a delightful coincidence darra singh the author of the report our shared future pdf published by the commission for integration and cohesion is also the chief executive of ealing council he was unable to implement one of the key recommendations of his report on his own patch an irony much appreciated by sbs and its supporters one of the more ridiculous arguments made by ealing was that sbs was itself in breach of the race relations act because its name prevented white women from accessing the services counsel for the ehrc suggested that on those grounds sbs should be called southall black and white siblings on a more serious note ealing now has to go back to the drawing board to develop a carefully considered policy on domestic violence services until a new provider is in place they will have to carry on funding sbs costs were awarded against ealing council the amount you guessed it now what was the sum of money that was up for grabs perhaps a concerned ealing resident should launch proceedings against the council for such a gross waste of taxpayers

in the early s a story broke in the british tabloids of the brutal rape of thousands of croatian and bosnian women by serbian irregulars on the front pages was a picture of what was quickly dubbed a rape baby and the then minister for the environment tim yeo announced that he was going to cut the bureaucratic red tape to allow childless british couples to adopt these unwanted children who were assumed to be clogging up the orphanages of central europe older journalistic hands were sceptical this was the first time i heard the term the fog of war there was an assumption that the rape story was simply the usual antiserb propaganda the then features editor of the independent on sunday sue matthias now acting editor of the new statesman asked me if i could try to get to the bottom of the matter specifically where the story had originated after a week of phonebashing in london i learned that the allegations of mass rape had originated with a croatian womens group who had been getting reports from women who said they had been raped from there the story was passed on to a german feminist magazine and was picked up by one of the german mass circulation news magazines before making it across the channel to the uk as part of my background research i read susan brownmillers groundbreaking study against our will men women and rape published in which documented the use of rape in warfare as an element of warfare as an aspect of the subjugation of the enemy alongside other techniques like ethnic cleansing rape in war she asserted was less to do with sex than it was with violence there was a tendency for women not to be believed when they alleged mass rape the anonymous german author of a woman in berlin published in the s gave a devastating account of the rape of civilian german women by the advancing red army some of whose troops might a few months before have been liberating auschwitz the german press was merciless it was impossible that a middleclass german woman would allow her honour to be sullied they said the author must be making it up the book was suppressed until after the authors death decades later nonetheless the story of the mass rape by serb paramilitaries of bosnian and croatian civilians began to assume a currency in the media figures as high as raped women were being quoted why was this a story now when it had not been before the international red cross conceded that for a woman to report a rape in wartime they would have to find an interpreter probably male and then present herself at their offices to give an account of the assault to a male officer what was different in croatia and bosnia was that this was the first war that had been monitored by womens organisations which received reports and collected data it was also perhaps the first war in which women were in increasingly large numbers gaining high profile positions in journalism after the piece came out i was contacted by veronica waddley then features editor of the telegraph now editor of the evening standard she told me that the foreign editor had read my piece in the independent on sunday and felt that i had a point that perhaps these mass rapes really had happened and would i like to go and see for myself i had no experience as a war correspondent and was advised it was extremely dangerous to go to sarajevo but i accepted the commission in zagreb a farcical situation developed i had been warned in no uncertain terms not to enter bosnia without press credentials issued by the un but due to a bureaucratic snafu they had run out of the actual cards holed up in a grandiose fin de sicle hotel eating a heavy diet of flambed cherries i went every day to the un office to try to get my press card and every day returned emptyhanded i had a flak jacket and an interpreter but nothing to do and nobody to interview it was the first time in my career that the wellknown phrase anyone here been raped and speak english came in handy so i went to do a tour of the hospitals there an additional complicating factor became apparent i interviewed the doctor who had delivered the rape baby whose picture featured on the front of the tabloids do the sums he told me the baby had been conceived before the bosnian war started in his opinion the mother was terrified of telling her parents she had allowed herself to get pregnant by her boyfriend the figures for births had not spiked since the start of the war that did not mean that he believed there had been no mass rape a number of factors could he suggested have depressed the numbers of pregnancies during the heavy shelling many women ceased to menstruate free abortion on demand was available up to weeks but yet more disconcerting were the statistics themselves how many women had been raped the numbers were impossible to collate some women had been raped multiple times by gangs of paramilitaries did that count as one rape or dozens either way it could only result in one potential pregnancy on other occasions one rape had been witnessed and reported by dozens of eyewitnesses another day i interviewed a psychiatrist who had been caring for patients traumatised by war jungiantrained she told me that in the early stages she regarded the lurid stories of mass rape as aspects of unconscious desires only after hearing several similar accounts did she start to believe that these were accounts of real rapes that had actually happened just weeks before then there was the question of the infamous rape camps the word camp conjures up an image of barracks barbed war guard towers what had actually happened was that serb irregulars would move into a town commandeer a small motel or school round up a group of women and incarcerate them there for nights of drugs drink and rape in the mornings they would head off to war high on ecstasy the first time this drug had been used in wartime leaving one of their number behind to guard the girls and return in the evening to get even more smashed and rape some more after a week or two they would move on to the next town we will never know how many women were raped in bosnia and croatia what we do know is that mass rape occurred and it was not a specific aspect of serb brutality there has always been rape in war what this war did was to bring it out of the shadows out of the dismissive inattention that accompanies the phrase war propaganda or the fog of war rape is as much a fact of war of the control of civilian populations as ethnic cleansing it took a modern womens movement to collect the data and a critical mass of women journalists to insist on writing about it from then on rape in war would be taken seriously with the arrest two days ago of radovan karadzic and his forthcoming trial in the hague there might now be

on friday louise brown will celebrate her th birthday if you cant quite place the name she was the first child to be born through ivf invitro fertilisation the trailblazer for one and a half million test tube babies worldwide the science may now be well established more than women have ivf treatment in the uk every year producing fullterm pregnancies and babies including the multiple births but funding arrangements are still struggling to catch up as many couples struggle to get the necessary time off work and to pay for the treatment however could come to be seen as a breakthrough year employers are starting to develop formal policies to help couples following a european court of justice case brought against her employer by sabine mayr an austrian waitress in february the court ruled that sacking a woman because she was receiving ivf was sex discrimination the ruling will also apply to less favourable treatment stopping short of dismissal according to solicitors eversheds an employer who for example failed to promote a woman because she was feeling unwell and taking time off during the ivf course could also be on difficult ground since damages for sex discrimination are unlimited averaging in employment tribunals in wellorganised employers are taking the issue seriously banking group hsbc which has staff in the uk gives up to days paid leave for ivf treatment but finds that women rarely need more than of them asda is another leading light women among its strong workforce can get up to five paid days off a year for fertility treatment and men either as partners or if having treatment themselves can have up to one and a half days asda claims that when it introduced its scheme in it was the first uk employer to give paid leave lloyds tsbs policy for its employees is less clearcut advising line managers to choose on a casebycase basis from three options paid compassionate leave unpaid leave or insisting that the time off comes out of holiday leave large companies such as these will have a big influence on other employers looking around the marketplace before they develop their own policies naeema choudry employment specialist at eversheds is beginning to advise employers on the issue some will give paid time off but will limit it to a certain number of days she says if however someone becomes unwell because of fertility treatment then normal sickness rules apply so if a woman suffers the headaches hot flushes and other sideeffects that campaigning and support group infertility network uk says can accompany the treatment to stimulate the hormones during ivf she should be able to get sick pay but mistakes will be made adds choudry many smaller employers do not closely follow european court of justice decisions and pregnancyrelated problems are notoriously badly handled by lowpaying employers the chartered institute of personnel and development encourages employers to put in place policies that would clarify the issues perhaps giving staff the option of requesting paid leave to deal with domestic issues such as this choudry believes that employers can benefit from policies that encourage staff to feel supported she says women who are given paid time off will work harder to repay the trust that has been put in them there are some who argue that ivf is a right lots of people see infertility treatment as a lifestyle choice but infertility is an illness says susan seenan of infertility network uk she is concerned by the attitudes of some employers and at the lack of funding for treatment from primary care trusts women can be turned down for free treatment if they are overweight if they smoke if they are over or under or if they fail to meet other criteria that the network has found trusts operating seenan estimates that at the most only per cent of trusts would give the three free ivf cycles originally envisaged in by the national institute for clinical excellence since private treatment costs between and according to the network it is too expensive for many couples one in seven couples is estimated to have problems conceiving the process can be traumatic and is often made worse by the financial element if women can be direct and honest with their employers about why they may need time off then everyone benefits says ben willmott of the chartered institute of personnel and development its much better to have a culture where people can be open than one where they take time off without being entirely honest about it he says following yesterdays national infertility day the infertility network has helped to organise a conference at the new connaught rooms in london on friday to mark years of ivf and to call for improved funding the hope is that by the time louise brown is much more of the financial difficulty facing wouldbe parents will have been overcome third time of asking karen chamberlain has had three cycles of ivf treatment while working as a training manager for her employer the windscreenreplacement company autoglass she decided to go for ivf when she had been there only nine months and tentatively asked if she could have time off i felt it was a big ask she says but i sensed that they thought a lot of their employees autoglass gave her three days off and paid her for it too for her second treatment session she decided to take holiday and for a third visit last october she took unpaid leave i didnt feel that it would be reasonable to go back and ask for more paid time off she says like many women she suffered the uncertainty about whether it would be successful i went through quite a bad time after the second failure and work were very understanding she was grateful for the tacit sympathy she got from her team she had not spoken about it publicly and for the explicit help she got from her boss for the third course of treatment she wanted to be in the best possible physical and psychological state her employer worked with her to ensure that everything would be managed well in her absence which helped to reduce the stress she was under karen says if people at work had not been so understanding i think that would have had quite a detrimental effect on me their help has been crucial the third treatment was successful karen and her partner marc are the proud parents of threeweekold twins chloe and emma,2008-07,friday louise

fatherhood is back in the political ring in the right corner david camerons comments about black fathers revive the conservative instinct for a scapegoat in the left corner the equalities and human rights commissions working better initiative has joined with mumsnetcom and dad info to launch home front what do mums and dads need to make life work for the right paternal responsibility is the bedrock of patriarchal social order for the left paternal responsibility is about a new kind of democratic settlement between men and women fatherhood today is measured against the model of the man as family provider the breadwinner supporting wife and children this is a modern invention of the middle classes and only became the norm in the s in the past paternity was never enough to qualify men for fatherhood patriarchy was limited to propertied men colonialism ensured it was further restricted to white men there were plenty of biological fathers who lived without families this was not about mens moral failings but a structural problem since the s historic changes in the economy and in gender relations have returned us to this age paternity no longer means fatherhood in the s mass unemployment and the closure of manufacturing industries destroyed many mens role as family breadwinner capitalism restructured around a lowwage flexible labour market mens family wage and job for life disappeared and large numbers of women were drawn into the workforce as mens incomes stagnated or fell women took on a double shift of paid work and unpaid domestic labour working class survival and middle class lifestyle once managed on a mans single income now require two incomes and often multiple parttime jobs the role of family breadwinner is now unattainable for the majority of fathers in britain for many young workingclass people marriage and setting up a family home has become a distant dream low wages and a lack of affordable housing makes it increasingly difficult for many young men to create an independent life of their own the traditional rites of passage into adulthood leaving home entering employment establishing a family and taking on legal obligations and rights have disappeared research by the centre right think tank civitas suggests that the higher rates of single parenthood and cohabitation in low income areas are not about feckless fathers or an antimarraige trend but to do with the structural problems of poverty and a low wage economy debates about fatherhood in recent years have all failed to recognise the structural changes within which men and women are forced to make choices and take decisions politicians of all parties go along with tabloid explanations of deadbeat dads the right wants to rewind years and reimpose the patriarchal roles of mothers and fathers labour despite the best efforts of feminism is silent and evasive about both masculinity and fatherhood the growing popularity of camerons conservatives has emboldened them to revive the old right wing responsibility agenda chris grayling the shadow minister for work and pensions has made a number of eloquent speeches on the subject we have a growing generation of young men alienated and drifting without a purpose in life they are causing trouble welfare programmes dont work and the criminal justice system is too soft many have grown up without fathers and many are becoming fathers in name but not in action the lack of fathers is a huge problem for all of us grayling is good at describing the problem but pointing the finger of blame at individual behaviour does not confront the bigger problem he has no solutions nor for that matter does labour the fact is that the kind of democratic fatherhood society aspires to is not compatible with our economic and class system which leaves men with either too little or too much work only one in five men takes advantage of the new paternity leave provision of two weeks off paid at a week because of financial pressures

as ever my last post on cif caused a major kerfuffle among those who refuse to accept that male violence towards women is endemic the statistics i used to show the commonplace nature of rape sexual assault and domestic violence are credible figures from government departments and major respected ngos but there will always be those mainly men who refuse to accept the facts and who are in denial about the dire situation so today i am turning my attention to something which surely even the most hardened misogynists will find it difficult to argue with support for the victimssurvivors of sexual violence over the past year we have heard about how rape crisis centres have been closing down at the rate of two per month there is no central government funding for the type of specialist care and advice desperately needed by women who experience the unique and deeply traumatising effects of sexual brutality but one scheme which has been running in london for a year is a brilliant example of what we should be demanding the government rolls out and funds across the uk for the simple reason that it works the amina scheme run by eaves a londonbased organisation which works to eliminate all aspects of violence against women is a support and befriending scheme for women who have been raped sexually assaulted or abused at any time in their lives amina uses a peermentoring method women using the scheme are supported by specially trained volunteers women who have themselves experienced sexual violence in the past the volunteers are not professionals restricted to providing support for a booked slot in a surgery once a week they are real women who can provide a listening ear over a coffee come along to an sti check give information about how women often react to sexual attacks and empathise with feelings fears and worries amina is not a counselling service but it works alongside counselling and other support services and acts as a bridge between the woman and other forms of specialist help and support this scheme is unique in the uk it should not be the government should pilot amina in every town and city in the uk at present amina operates on a shoestring so has only been able to facilitate small numbers of women taking part even so during the time amina has been operational women all of whom have experienced sexual violence themselves have been trained to be volunteers and have between them supported many women who might have had nowhere to go if amina had not been available to them but what about women in other areas of the uk should they not have the option of being supported by women who know exactly what they are going through not only that but if and when these women feel able they can themselves train to become supporters themselves and feel what one service user called the immense satisfaction of helping women who come after them the scheme is hard work volunteers meet with women once a week meet with scheme organisers once at month and check in with one another to debrief and chat its a heavy commitment but it has rewards women using the scheme change through their time with it they gain access to counselling group support and language classes women who were unable to travel at night are now socialising those with substance misuse issues have remained clean and some women have decided to report abusers to the police but amina is not just about the women using the scheme the volunteers running it are also seeing rewards volunteers have new skills new understandings of violence against women one described it as being like a feminist waking up roaring inside there are new career opportunities new life opportunities and a chance to see themselves as supporters not just survivors the volunteers have attended reclaim the night marches international womens day events undergone selfdefence training and represented the scheme at the guardian womens pages th party last year cat whitehouse the amina coordinator is

women are getting fewer senior jobs in the civil service than they were a year ago whitehall watchdogs said today in their annual report the civil service commissioners said that the number of women being appointed to senior jobs in the civil service was lower than at any point since they also said that they were concerned that there was some evidence that women were more likely than men to be paid below the advertised rate when accepting top civil service jobs but the civil service commissioners who are in charge of ensuring that senior whitehall appointments are made on merit said that there had been a significant increase in the number of the most important jobs going to women of the very senior appointments made in defined as those at senior leadership committee level went to women compared to the year before but among all senior appointments supervised by the commissioners in only went to women the figure was in in and in the commissioners said if women are being less successful in gaining appointments to jobs outside the top then the pool of women civil servants who can compete for the top jobs in the civil service will be depleted they also said there was continuing evidence of successful candidates for jobs being paid below the rate advertised and that there seemed to be a disproportionate chance of this happening to women of the seven civil servants paid above the advertised rate in five were men and two were women but of the paid below the advertised rate five were women the commissioners said they would be monitoring this carefully over the coming year,2008-07,woman getting fewer senior job civil service year ago whitehall watchdog said today annual report civil service commissioner said number woman appointed senior job civil service wa lower point since also said concerned wa evidence woman likely men paid advertised rate accepting top civil service job civil service commissioner charge ensuring senior whitehall appointment made merit said significant increase number important job going woman senior appointment made defined senior leadership committee level went woman compared year among senior appointment supervised commissioner went woman figure wa commissioner said woman less successful gaining appointment job outside top pool woman civil servant compete top job civil service depleted also said wa continuing evidence successful candidate job paid rate advertised seemed disproportionate chance happening woman seven civil servant paid advertised rate five men two woman paid advertised rate five woman commissioner said would monitoring carefully coming year,"['woman', 'getting', 'fewer', 'senior', 'job', 'civil', 'service', 'year', 'ago', 'whitehall', 'watchdog', 'said', 'today', 'annual', 'report', 'civil', 'service', 'commissioner', 'said', 'number', 'woman', 'appointed', 'senior', 'job', 'civil', 'service', 'wa', 'lower', 'point', 'since', 'also', 'said', 'concerned', 'wa', 'evidence', 'woman', 'likely', 'men', 'paid', 'advertised', 'rate', 'accepting', 'top', 'civil', 'service', 'job', 'civil', 'service', 'commissioner', 'charge', 'ensuring', 'senior', 'whitehall', 'appointment', 'made', 'merit', 'said', 'significant', 'increase', 'number', 'important', 'job', 'going', 'woman', 'senior', 'appointment', 'made', 'defined', 'senior', 'leadership', 'committee', 'level', 'went', 'woman', 'compared', 'year', 'among', 'senior', 'appointment', 'supervised', 'commissioner', 'went', 'woman', 'figure', 'wa', 'commissioner', 'said', 'woman', 'less', 'successful', 'gaining', 'appointment', 'job', 'outside', 'top', 'pool', 'woman', 'civil', 'servant', 'compete', 'top', 'job', 'civil', 'service', 'depleted', 'also', 'said', 'wa', 'continuing', 'evidence', 'successful', 'candidate', 'job', 'paid', 'rate', 'advertised', 'seemed', 'disproportionate', 'chance', 'happening', 'woman', 'seven', 'civil', 'servant', 'paid', 'advertised', 'rate', 'five', 'men', 'two', 'woman', 'paid', 'advertised', 'rate', 'five', 'woman', 'commissioner', 'said', 'would', 'monitoring', 'carefully', 'coming', 'year']",201
every year women are raped in the uk and lose their job simply because they are pregnant in the face of such daily violations of womens human rights arguments about the proportion of women in parliament can seem trivial yes women make up only of mps but perhaps this is an issue best addressed once weve tackled the rest in the meantime we should feel confident about the workings of parliament because men represent the interests of their entire constituency dont they but every now and then a newspaper headline reminds us how dangerous this argument is and the price all of us are paying for the underrepresentation of women in power last week there were two such headlines on monday a fawcett society report revealed the huge regional variation in rape conviction rates on the back of this john yates the assistant commissioner of the metropolitan police called for specialist units in every police force to ensure consistent quality services to all rape victims the second revelation came in a report from the healthcare commission it catalogued shocking failures in maternity services these stories have a crucial link in both cases it is women who are the sole or main users of the services and they share common themes insufficent funding and misplaced priorities mean services are being sidelined in the dash to meet performance targets we live in a wealthy society yet fail to provide specialist support for victims of rape in a third of local authorities we have poured billions of additional funding into the nhs and yet do not have sufficient beds or bathrooms for women in labour granted there are failures in all areas of public provision but the failure to support women adequately at such critical times in their lives can only be described as institutional sexism the reality is that having women in decisionmaking positions makes a significant difference to the issues brought to the table the increase in the number of women mps in meant that childcare domestic violence and flexible working were placed on the political agenda indeed the issues are now so mainstream we forget how recently they were dismissed as personal matters of course the impact of increasing womens representation in parliament cannot be boiled down to a simple equation an x increase in the number of women mps will lead to a y improvement in services there are women who define their political careers by not commenting on these issues and others who pursue the agenda with a passion and it is condescending to men to argue that male mps cannot address sexism the example of both john yates and ian kennedy who chairs the healthcare commission demonstrate how men continue to be key partners in the process of change the legislation that granted the vote for women was after all passed by an allmale parliament demands to increase the number of women in politics does however recognise the fact that women continue to have different life experiences based on their sex this is reflected in both the style of their politics and how they define it we will naturally get better decision making when the class of people who experience for example genderbased violence or motherhood are present in the room when decisions are made about how to tackle them today we have to work within the maledominated power structures to bring about change ultimately those power structures need to be shared equally to ensure that the problems dont emerge in the first place when priorities are set they should reflect the needs of the entire population only then will we see the end to headlines about the scandalously poor provision for women,2008-07,every year woman raped uk lose job simply pregnant face daily violation womens human right argument proportion woman parliament

ah theres nothing like a tragic love story and indeed what follows is nothing like a tragic love story for if you listen carefully you may just be able to catch the sound of highend scuttling from the other side of the pond that would be the manhattan rats leaving the sinking ships or sinking husbands pretty much the same thing it appears that the credit crunch has sent topflight new york divorce business rocketing up per cent as the trophy wives of wall streets beleaguered superwealthy executives hedge funders property developers race to lawyers to cite irreconcilable differences which in this case roughly translates as hes poor now its got so bad that some wall street husbands are trying to hang on to their wives by taking out huge loans to maintain their mansions yachts and saks accounts however lawyers are saying that wives arent interested in standing by their men opting instead to end their marriages as quickly and clinically as a bad credit card snipped in half in front of you in a restaurant the whole debacle amounts to a somewhat ruthless if the gravy train is over then so are we darling the only appropriate response is how appalling what kind of cow leaves a marriage just because the helicopter has left the lawn indeed any decent person should despise these women right well no actually wrong it seems to me that these women are loyal to a fault that is loyal to the deal that was originally struck when you think about it there is a world of difference between being a trophy wife waving hubby off on his private jet while you face another day of lonely unfulfilled spending in barneys to being a real wife having some sacked bitter bozo under your feet all day reliving past glories hogging the remote control and asking too many questions about your lipofund more to the point before we all start working ourselves into a righteous lather over the behaviour of the trophy wives these masters of the universe knew what they were getting into after all werent they the ones who brokered the deal in the first place their cash and status for a trophy wife someone to make their peers drool so no cash no trophy wife its a simple enough psychosexual equation cold yes but only as cold as the one that makes it clear to the trophy wife that she will be unceremoniously dumped trumpstyle for a new hottie if she commits the crimes of becoming fat old or ivana the patron saint of failed trophy wives in short in the land of the deal the fleeing ratwives have a point what does love have to do with it indeed while the new breed of creditcrunch bailerwives might be ruthless maybe they learned from their masters only last week i was hard at work doing research ok sprawled on the sofa reading the daily mail and came across the tale of arpad busson the hedgefund philanthropist and multizillionaire who had a nineyear twochildren relationship with model elle macpherson allegedly couldnt marry her because he was a strict catholic and she was a divorcee and then went on to propose to twicedivorced uma thurman just as i was thinking nice guy way to go uma i came across another tale of superrich lurrve gone sour christie brinkleys hamptons paradise was shattered when her husband was discovered paying off a neighbours teenage daughter to keep quiet about their affair just in case christie hadnt been humiliated enough the divorce judge commented that she might care to examine her taste in men at which point you think enough already whatever happened to the great highend romances the ones that were examples to us all bogie and bacall scott and zelda bill and monica which for their sins were about love sex and madness anything but money so what are we seeing here the revenge of the trophy spouse certainly its a timely reminder to the rich of manhattan that the first law of the trophy wife is that she natch atrophies at the first sign of trouble for the rest of us its culturally interesting in the aftermath of another great period of international stress it was noted rather droningly that every day brought a new life lesson with this in mind maybe we should take heed of the morality tales emerging from the creditcrunch crisis certainly it seems to say something that the relationships of the rich seem to be the first ones to go while the poor are sticking together the rich are splitting like atoms has schadenfreude ever tasted so sweet noble rugby chaps behaving like plebby footballers i say thats not cricket now let me just get my facts straight footballers are the yobbish greedy sexually depraved disgrace of the british sporting world meanwhile other team sports such as rugby and cricket are throwbacks to a nobler less oikish era when men were gentlemen england was forever england dignity meant all and excuse me i feel slightly bilious ill be back after some alkaseltzer how many times have i heard this kind of guff even fallen for it however it doesnt add up especially not after a week when england rugby players mike brown and topsy ojo have been shown to have been coldly sexually opportunistic towards a teenage girl they met during a tour of new zealand details are scarce but it seems that the girl agreed to have sex with one of them and then another i believe the term is roasting gentlemen now brown and ojo have been found guilty of misconduct for staying out all night the rfu said their behaviour was inconsistent with the life of an elite professional rugby player in the modern era well that told them its a puzzle why do people persist in thinking there is anything automatically noble about sport when logic dictates that its about as automatically noble as bingo or any other form of popular entertainment once society starts grading team sports in terms of nobility the class divisions soon become laughably obvious it cant be a coincidence that there are predominantly middleclass cricketers and rugby players at the top and workingclass footballers at the bottom not that this is a great week to defend football in the current climate frank lampard should maybe have thought twice before moaning that his millions werent enough then there is the increasingly surreal cristiano ronaldoreal madrid signing fracas if he is manchester uniteds slave then im a promising centre forward however arent all sportsmen conditioned to be overpaid brats these days what seems certain is that if the sport of football has problems it is not the only one while the full facts are yet to be revealed it does sound like certain nice middleclass rugby players may be as into roasting as any plebby pissed opportunistic bunch of footballers what i want to know is where is the similar uproar how exciting that barack obama will visit the uk weve all become such obama groupies it would be disappointing not to see scenes as frenzied as the osmonds arriving in the s i may pop down to the airport and do a bit of screaming and swaying with a tasselled scarf obama is not this popular in the states if youre getting civil rights legend jesse jackson caught on mike saying he wants to cut his nuts off or as one report primly had it his twin objects of male anatomy so maybe when barack comes over here we should just keep him like when kathy bates kept james caan in misery our boy may need some gentle persuasion like breaking his legs a bit never mind all that us presidency stuff wouldnt he be better off here in the uk where he is obsessively loved,2008-07,ah nothing like tragic love story indeed follows nothing like tragic love story listen carefully may able

the story of a marriage by andrew sean greer pp faber in the year in which andrew sean greers third novel is mostly set pearlie cook greers narrator and her husband holland are living in san francisco with their infant son like many other young couples in their fogbound neighbourhood the cooks served their country in the recent war holland was a soldier in the pacific theatre while pearlie along with only a few other girls from a community like mine left their small southern hometown to do auxiliary work for the navy yet the postwar world doesnt seem filled with promise to them relations with their neighbours are oddly guarded people stare at them in restaurants and when pearlie has lunch with hollands elderly twin cousins they eat in a special area of a departmentstore lunchroom after being turned away by two others one day a goldenhaired stranger shows up and politely removes his hat i wasnt pearlie writes very used to men like him removing their hats in my presence unspoken prohibitions are also at work in their household holland a dark strikingly attractive man whose job at a fittings company often keeps him away from home needs a calming environment husband and wife sleep in separate bedrooms their telephone has a muted ring and pearlie has even managed to find them a dog that doesnt bark she has arranged all this because before their marriage which took place when they were reunited by chance after the war hollands cousins warned her that he suffers from bad blood a crooked heart there isnt it seems a cure for this condition dont let him out of your sight the cousins added he shouldnt need to go downtown or worry over the past at this point one of them got worked up and shouted dont do it dont marry him but pearlie decided that i hadnt heard right it was so absurd so crazed into this setup comes the goldenhaired stranger who introduces himself to pearlie as buzz a friend of hollands from the war years and almost immediately greer fills in some of the yawning blanks that give his opening section the artificial slightly tinny resonance of a narrative laying the groundwork for a series of twists pearlie is a reader of ford madox ford will holland turn out to be a compulsive adulterer along the lines of edward ashburnham in the good soldier not quite buzz reveals to pearlie that hes hollands former lover the two of them met in hospital during the war holland left him when pearlie reappeared on the scene but now buzz wants him back if pearlie will agree to step aside buzz will give her his considerable fortune she says shell think it over in those days she writes there were limited options for coloured girls like me this moment of putative revelation pearlies first direct acknowledgment that the cooks are africanamerican fits neatly into the novels general scheme again and again as the ensuing story plays out greer toys with the readers presumed preconceptions as his characters make reliably mistaken surmises about one another one of the preconceptions thats central to his theme is the idea that the american s were sunnily innocent years an idea with great purchase on the conservative imagination for pearlie the pressing facts about are the korean war the precivil rights racial dispensation the fears of nuclear war the execution of the rosenbergs and the persecution of homosexuals against this backdrop her interest in silences misunderstandings and peoples manysidedness acquires a historical dimension for her and the other characters many things cant be openly said pearlie has a taste for aphoristic musings we think we know the ones we love she writes but what we love turns out to be a poor translation a translation we ourselves have made from a language we barely know these quasiproustian observations and their associated metaphors are brought to a state of high polish but greers plotting doesnt always live up to pearlies commentary a sidestory involving a spirited white girl whos secretly engaged to a prejudiced sodajerk is tacked on to the main plot in a way thats both implausible and underexplained pearlies sympathy for buzz blooms remarkably quickly and theres an excess of busily symbolic detail if the characters watch a movie overhear a tv show or read the words printed on a paper bag what they come across will be eerily reflective of their predicament most of all greers first big narrative bombshell doesnt detonate with the force that he seems to be hoping for after all the wary looks from white neighbours references to the status of the coloured population mentions of pearlies community and descriptions of visits to segregated lunchrooms only very inattentive readers will be startled to learn that the cooks are black some might even wonder why pearlie has tried to play such a heavyhanded trick the surprises in what follows are managed more skilfully and greer has clearly done his homework on the time hes depicting but the artificial slightly tinny resonance never goes

the campaign for the parliamentary vote for women in britain was a long and bitter struggle that began in the midth century however it really took off in when emmeline pankhurst founded the womenonly womens social and political union wspu with the slogan deeds not words the charismatic emmeline a brilliant orator together with her eldest daughter christabel the key strategist of the wspu roused the women of britain to abandon the ladylike tactics of the national union of womens suffrage societies and to demand not ask for their democratic birthright the suffragettes engaged in daring and brave deeds often putting their own lives at risk even when engaging in peaceful demonstrations but from more violent tactics were adopted including windowsmashing raids in londons west end and the vandalising of pillar boxes such a change in strategy which never endangered human life was a response to the stubbornness of the liberal government of the day that over a long period of time had debated womens suffrage bills but never passed them and then prohibited women from protesting in public arenas many of the women who were imprisoned adopted the hunger strike as a political tool only to be forcibly fed by an unyielding government at the outbreak of the first world war in the patriotic pankhursts called a halt to all militancy and urged their followers to take up war work as a way to win their enfranchisement that wish was partly fulfilled when on february nine months before the war ended eight and a half million women over years of age householders wives of householders occupiers of property of or more annual value and university graduates were finally allowed to vote the suffragette campaign was lead by and for women who wanted not just the vote but wider social reforms that would end womens subordinate roles in the family education and employment as well as the double standard of sexuality yet the many male historians who have written about the movement usually see it as a singleissue campaign and fail to capture the sexual dynamics of the drama of particular importance is george dangerfields the strange death of liberal england published in which discusses the suffragette movement as one of the forces in the downfall of the liberal party as the first male historian to treat the womens movement seriously his book was widely cited and reprinted well into the s writing from a perspective that sees the suffragettes as a deviant and marginal aberration from the main business of male political elites dangerfield presents them as irrational even dangerous beings whose deeds cannot be classified as political mocking what he terms these daring ladies with their high starched collars and corseted bosoms he presents them as demented creatures who chose the hardships of prison life including forcible feeding in a sadomasochistic way despite the gendered nature of dangerfields analysis the strange death of liberal england set the scene for many subsequent male historians who were unable to break free from the grip of his narrative writing the suffragettes out of winning the vote or diminishing their contribution as a feminist historian steeped in the primary sources of the wspu i have frequently challenged such masculinist accounts and got into arguments most recently with christopher bearman in bbc history magazine as bearman makes clear he does not like feminists and believes that the suffragettes were lawless terrorists who delayed votes for women feminist historians such as myself he asserts perpetuate a suffragette mythology that it was a mass movement that militancy won the vote that there was no threat to life that forcible feeding outraged public opinion and that they enjoyed popular support what is remarkable in bearmans analysis is that nowhere does he listen to the suffragettes themselves his evidence is based on newspaper accounts of the time all filtered through a male gaze that thought the suffragettes and their leaders were irrational even mad nor does bearman consider his own standpoint his own gendered interpretation of events that i should have been attacked in this way doesnt surprise me womens history is not just about finding women hidden in the past but about changing the way they have been traditionally represented about letting their voices be heard the suffragettes contributed to the making of our modern democracy by bringing about a cultural change in the way in which women were seen they aroused a passionate discussion about womens status and inequality in society so that mens ideological hold over women was never the same no longer doormats but assertive strongminded women without their struggle the franchise act would not have been passed,2008-07,campaign parliamentary

if white women are underrepresented in the public sphere then black women are near to invisible one reason is that while the feminist movement has been the main organisational driver for female involvement in politics most black women feel excluded by it in theory black woman are natural feminists and in principle i am happy to call myself one but in practice the unrelentingly white and middleclass nature of the modern womens movement has repelled many of us inspired by simone de beauvoir and betty friedan i joined my first womens group in my teens i felt a little out of place among the white suburban housewives but i persevered however when they started planning a fundraiser that featured a black male stripper their knowing sniggers got to me and i fled as a cambridge undergraduate i tried again i was the only black woman in the studentonly group but that was ok then they decided to invite a woman from the town to talk the way my fellow students stared at that poor workingclass woman as if she was a laboratory specimen was too much for me and i terminated my involvement with the formal womans movement in the s black women who believed in the principles of feminism but felt excluded by the womens movement set up a black feminist organisation called the organisation of woman of african and asian descent owaad i still remember the early inspirational conferences but it eventually faded away in the s and s i was also a strong supporter of the campaign to get more women mps in parliament we succeeded in getting the labour party to adopt the controversial policy of allwomen shortlists but of all the women elected to parliament in on that system not a single one was black it seemed that more women in parliament meant more white women i had already been elected to parliament by then in on an ordinary shortlist and i was on the labour party national executive it was clear that new black women candidates were not emerging so i pushed the party to arrange special training weekends for potential black female parliamentary candidates lots of intelligent and lively women attended but the party officials who came to observe the weekends regarded them with distaste it was clear that they were not interested in talent they were looking for women they could control i was elected more than years ago there is still only one other black woman in the house of commons dawn butler mp but in local government things have actually gone backwards in the s there were two black female council leaders in london merle amory in brent and linda bellos in lambeth now there are none i remember the many clever and charismatic black female activists i worked with in the s on a range of grassroots campaigns they should be in parliament today maybe they had too much sense but it is parliaments loss,2008-07,white woman underrepresented public sphere black woman near invisible one reason feminist movement ha main organisational driver female

from ballot to web cath elliott in women were granted equal voting rights with men it had been years since the representation of the people act first enabled them to take their place at the ballot box but during those years while men over could vote women had to wait until they were in july that all changed when royal assent was given to the equal franchise act and the dreams of the suffragettes were finally realised but what has been the impact of the vote on womens lives and how have women in all sorts of ways all over the world moved into the public realm an area that was once a strictly male preserve when i first became involved in politics at the grand old age of and for many years afterwards political activism for women meant endless meetings sexist jibes on the picket line and being roped in to help out with the crche men still dominated the political discourse while women were expected to make the tea and sandwiches if women wanted to participate in the debates we had to learn to be as vocal as them to speak up instead of waiting to be asked for our opinions and then we had to be prepared to fight our corner along with the best of them for a bit of respite from all that testosterone and to help ensure that womens issues were kept on the agenda we organised ourselves into womens groups safe womenonly spaces where we could plan strategies to increase womens involvement in political life and discuss our experiences and where those who werent yet comfortable with speaking out in public meetings could air their opinions this grounding in such a maledominated environment stood me in good stead for my later involvement in the trade union movement where even today there are plenty of men who continue to treat women activists with a level of tokenism that would have incensed our suffragist foremothers women are welcome in trade unions of course but it has been an uphill struggle for us to get our issues taken seriously or for womens equality to be paid much more than lip service the internet is helping with this change where we once had a very real fight on our hands to get our voices heard above the male fray women have now created a space where we not only can be heard but if we choose we can shut out the brouhaha coming from some of the more unreconstructed men on the net the blogosphere is the biggest public space weve ever had we owe it to the women who fought so hard to secure us the vote years ago to make the most of the opportunities a forum such as this gives us and to ensure that women are and always will be playing an equal role with men in the political and public life of this country in all its manifestations posted on comment is free nine times in we dont know the sex of a poster on comment is free surely this means there can be no sexual prejudice necroflangerie at first i did find some of the more straightforward posters on the website a bit intimidating but i have learned to give as good as i get in my own way i was called a retired slapper this morning annetan even on comment is free there are men who call on others to be banned merely because they disagree with them luckily you cant interrupt in cif in fact there are many advantages we can take in the web no need to fear physical violence for one anonymity is another and its always possible to pose as a man ultimathule where are all the mps lesley abdela in when the equal franchise act was passed it raised among british women huge hopes that quite soon they would become equal participants with men in the house of commons eighty years on the uk parliament rates th in the world league of women in parliament one ignoble place below cambodia womens representation in politics is not linked to whether a country is rich or poor the us has women representatives japan has women in the diet rwanda with and sweden with have the highest representation of women in any parliament in the world versus the uk at just over women mps if the tories win the next election the percentage of women in the mother of parliaments is likely to tumble even lower down the league for over a quarter of a century the political parties have said repetitively and routinely that they want to increase the number of female mps party leaders have simply not delivered the goods there is still only one woman in every five mps posted on cif perhaps its not the number of women politicians that count so much as the quality of the ones in parliament blairs babes as they were known were an identikit bunch who were instantly forgettable brusselsexpats we had a very good female mp julia drown who campaigned on behalf of victims of domestic abuse more childfriendly facilities in the house of commons and lower speed limits outside schools unfortunately she found that she could not combine her parliamentary duties with those of being a mother of two young childrenangrygranny not all bad jackie ashley its wrong to assume that womens suffrage has made little difference a recent book women in parliament the new suffragettes by boni sones chronicles the experiences of many of todays mps and asks for their assessment of what women have achieved in parliament and when you hear the catalogue of new laws that have been passed largely due to the backing of women mps you realise that yes they have shaken things up quite a lot think of many of the key achievements of the blairbrown years and you are thinking of womens achievements from sure start the new deal for lone parents the big extension in childcare the increase in both maternity and paternity leave the introduction and extension of flexible working for parents the minimum wage and progress on the pay gap only this week we have seen the new equalities bill in parliament piloted by harriet harman ending discrimination for older people as well as women and ethnic minorities might the men have got there alone i doubt it because women mps have themselves experienced how hard it is to juggle work and family making them much more forceful in agitating for new laws they have also lobbied women journalists in the unofficial circles that exist at westminster to push such issues up the political agenda there have been less mainstream issues too such as domestic violence rape trafficking of women and access to cancer services that have all been championed by women mps while blairs babes looked naive freshfaced and aware of how different they were todays mps look less excited and more ordinary and that perhaps is the biggest achievement of the women mps today its quite normal to see women at the centre of power without anyone batting an eye posted on cif a recent study by women in journalism discovered that women featured in only of newspaper photographs of professionals and of those of politicians this influences the choices we make in terms of our education and our careers it also influences our choices as to whether to enter politics we need to widen our perception of what success is and rather than ridiculing or shouting down the women who are succeeding allow them to share what it actually is that has driven them this

and the dreams of the suffragettes were finally realised to mark this important anniversary and to celebrate years of universal suffrage comment is free is this week running a series of articles examining the impact of the vote on womens lives and looking at how women have in all sorts of ways all over the world moved into the public realm an area that was once a strictly male preserve when i first became involved in politics at the grand old age of and for many years afterwards political activism for women meant endless meetings in smokefilled rooms sexist jibes on the picket line and being roped in to help out with the creche when there were important issues on the agenda men still dominated the political discourse while women were expected to make the tea and sandwiches if women

struggle for us to get our issues taken seriously or for womens equality to be paid much more than lip service and in the same way that womens groups have helped women find a place in party politics womens selforganisation in the trade unions is proving crucial to our increased participation in the wider labour movement the internet is also helping with this change where we once had a very real fight on our hands to get our voices heard above the masculine fray women have now created a space where we not only can be heard but if we choose we can shut out the brouhaha coming from some of the more unreconstructed men on the net as attendees at the recent blog nation debate discovered not only is the feminist blogosphere enjoying rude health but women bloggers and writers are a growing force on the web there are those like me who have opted to engage in some of the more maledominated corners of the blogosphere and there are others who have chosen to create more womenfriendly spaces virtual sanctuaries where women are free to debate their issues without having to worry about being shouted down by men and where any wouldbe trolls and harassers are swiftly and mercilessly dealt with in nattering on the net australian feminist dale spender writes in the real world men dominate communication men talk more often they talk for longer periods they adopt centering positions forcing females to hover around men define the topic assume the legitimacy of their own view and override women who do not see the world in their terms much of this dominant status is achieved by interrupting and correcting she goes on women are being kept out of cybercommunication with an electronic version of interruption and intimidation women are being silenced on the net that may well have been the case in when the book was written but im delighted to say that its most certainly not the case now despite some mens best efforts recent studies have shown that women are now spending more time online than men and while our internet usage may be different with men tending to use the net more for information gathering news and sports and women preferring to use it for communicating with friends through email exchanges and social networking sites theres growing evidence that there are now more women blogging than men that does not surprise me at all at blog nation and at an earlier discussion on the future of journalism here at the guardian there was intense debate about womens participation on the net there are some writers who feel that because of the sexist abuse that gets hurled at many women bloggers we shouldnt bother getting involved with some of the more political blogs and instead should limit our engagement to feminist or womenfriendly spaces on the net but i dont agree in the same way that women have had to jump in to other maledominated arenas in order to get our message across and to ensure our involvement in public and political life we cant afford to ignore the enormous potential the blogosphere affords us for both communicating our experience and making our voices count and while there will always be a place for womenonly spaces online spaces which i cherish when i need to take some air after the cut and thrust of my threads what we cant afford to do is isolate ourselves completely and shut ourselves away in a virtual world where all were doing is preaching to the converted the blogosphere is the biggest public space weve ever had we owe it to the women who fought so hard to secure us the vote years ago to make the most of the

i always had crushes always i can remember going to sleep aged six wondering so should i marry jimmy or tommy my friends and i were boycrazy we thought a lot about kissing i think a lot of romantic ideas when i was growing up in new jersey in the sixties were fed by movies until i discovered the books on my parents shelves when i was i can remember finding the fountainhead and sitting up when i read the part where a man bit a woman on the breast i was like why on earth would anyone do that why would she let him but romantic ideas and sexual ideas were certainly very big in my life and they were in all of my friends lives i remember very well how i felt as a young teenager in my writing im focused on the time where everything is new and you dont quite get it i connect with young people theres no question i cant explain that we look at each other and i know whats on their minds but even so i wasnt the perfect parent that some kids think i must be i get billions of letters from young people with problems and the more troubled kids seem to be writing to me from the uk usually girls its always been that way i think girls are more willing to admit that they have problems from my father i learned everything that i know about men that they can be nurturing that they can be funny and kind and loving and smart my mother wasnt the one who talked to us my father was the one who talked to me about everything he was the one i went to asking what happens to girls when theyre i was only eight at the time but yes he was the one who explained by the time i was called into his room for the birds and bees discussion of course it was way too late but he died so young only we never got to know each other as adults he led me to believe i could be anything i wanted to be yet when i was very young i made the odd decision to go over to my mothers side and marry early and have babies i still dont know why i did that maybe thats what we all did then ive had three husbands the first one i married at the next one was a very difficult relationship and it should have just been an affair and now im with george my best husband we met when we had just turned and weve been together years this morning i asked him what men want and he said sex sex sex women maybe want companionship a little more but i think a lot of men are spoilt by their mothers im guilty of that myself i have a son theres something wrong with every man i tell that to my daughter all the time i say look if you want someone in your life you have to make compromises ive hardly ever been single i think some of that had to do with fear of being alone you have to work to keep the passion going in a relationship you have to work at the sex part it can never be like when you were brand new again i was reminiscing with my old secretary and she said when you first met you couldnt keep your hands off each other everything was about the two of you being together she was witnessing this probably gagging i love men apart from one george bush im hoping that with the next presidential election that we will find ourselves in a better era where sex is not a dirty subject where puberty is a healthy subject where we wont have so much book banning in america im hoping politically that america is going to prove to the world that were not all bad,2008-07,always crush always remember going sleep aged six wondering marry jimmy tommy friend boycrazy thought lot kissing think lot romantic idea wa growing new jersey sixty fed movie discovered book parent shelf wa remember finding fountainhead sitting read part man bit woman breast wa like earth would anyone would let romantic idea sexual idea certainly big life friend life remember well felt young teenager writing im focused time everything new dont quite get connect young people question cant explain look know whats mind even wasnt perfect parent kid think must get billion letter young people problem troubled kid seem writing uk usually girl always way think girl willing admit problem father learned everything know men nurturing funny kind loving smart mother wasnt one talked u father wa one talked everything wa one went asking happens

there is indeed a war against women and it is very much a global war that is undermining aspirations for social and economic justice for women but also the fundamental basis for democratic change for all citizens now the backlash july the symptoms of a reversal of womens rights in the uk are even more severe in some developing countries abortion is already illegal in all cases in nicaragua and el salvador meanwhile our partners from africa asia and latin america all report that violence against women is an increasing barrier both to women standing for election and for those elected we are campaigning for greater representation of women in local and national politics because we believe it is a necessary step to address the bleak fact that of the worlds poorest people are women wed urge those who are concerned about the turning back of womens gains in the uk to look internationally too and join with those fighting in the global arena against violence and other barriers to womens participation graham bennett director one world action while not taking issue with kira cochranes main argument that feminism and women are increasingly under attack there are some holes in her argument that sadly may worsen the position of women who have been raped or suffered other violent or sexual assault rape crisis has indeed been facing difficulties and the reduction in the number of centres that it runs is a matter of concern but to imply that as a result there are no services to help women who have suffered violence is a distortion of the truth victim support alone helps about victims of rape every year plus another people affected by other sexual crimes most of them women we are also in discussion with rape crisis and other organisations to look at how we can further extend the help that does exist knowing where support is available and how to access it is crucial for women in need by painting a picture of helplessness in response to rape this article sadly risks exacerbating the very problems it highlights by denying women the information they need to get help should they become victims gillian guy chief executive victim support while lapdancing clubs flourish and rapecrisis centres close million women in the uk will experience rape domestic violence or forced marriage this year alone focusing resources on the criminal justice system when the majority of victims dont report whats happened to them doesnt make sense nor does allowing grassroots support groups to close for want of a few thousand pounds here and there and there is no plan to prevent violence even though studies show that young men in particular harbour worrying attitudes that justify and excuse violence against women this week we will present the government with a template of how a properly joinedup approach can deal with the scourge of violence against women we hope it will listen holly dustin end violence against women the conclusion reached by kira cochranes article that womens rights never take two steps backwards is ahistorical as is the view of womens equality as a steady upward rise over time a graph of feminist gains over the centuries shows periods of steep progress followed by slower dips as these advances were retracted or modified conditions often did return to where they were before or worse the strength of feminism is best measured by the number of women who align with the cause on that measure we are in a downward phase this slide is as attributable to female complacency as to conscious male backlash orna ross dublin ireland every few

homelessness educational achievement crime health average lifespan and access to children where men now fare worse peter totman london kira cochrane sees an allout assault on feminism in modern britain while she makes some very good points about continuing prejudice both at home and at work it seems a bit odd to claim the m paid to jennifer lopez for photographs of her new family is evidence of a world which hates women does cochrane think jlo should have turned down the money if so this might point to one explanation for the backlash she observes when faced with a choice between the instinctive feminism of a selfmade woman who starts a family during a hardworking career and the middleclass academic feminism of the s most people will side with jenny from the block simon hogg

i come in for a lot of criticism from defensive men when i write or speak publicly about domestic and sexual violence many cif readers post angry comments when i suggest that it is more than a handful of men who rape beat pimp and otherwise abuse females if i implied that only a few seriously deranged men harm women and children then i would be more popular among the apologists for violence towards women well sorry folks but i am going to try and tempt you out of your comfort zone once and for all a significant number of men abuse a significant number of women and children i am not saying that all men are rapists i am arguing based on solid fact rather than speculation and guesswork that more men than you are prepared to admit commit acts of sexual violence during my years of campaigning to end sexual violence i have amassed shedloads of evidence that proves this point here is the latest a welsh assembly member called nerys evans sent a questionnaire on sexual violence to all ams of the eight that responded three disclosed they had been raped five said they knew someone who had been sexually assaulted one was the victim of domestic violence all eight knew of someone who had experienced domestic violence no one directly affected had reported the crimes to the police evans said she was surprised at the results they are pretty shocking it just shows how widespread violence against women and domestic abuse is i am not nor will other women working in the field of sexual violence be surprised a separate survey of students also released today found that over onethird thought a woman was at least partially responsible for being raped or sexually assaulted if she was drunk almost twothirds knew women whose partners had hit them and knew women who had been coerced or pressurised into sex lets look at the other statistics one in four women experience domestic violence at some point in their lives and kill themselves because of it every week two are murdered each week for women under it is the most common cause of morbidity above both cancer and road accidents three million women across the uk suffer violence each year including rape domestic violence forced marriage stalking and sexual exploitation and traffickingprostitution almost half of women in england and wales experience domestic violence sexual assault or stalking in their lifetime one in five women in northern ireland experience domestic violence more than rapes were reported to the police in scotland in according to government figures violence against women costs bn a year in england and wales alone my question is this how can only a few men be abusing women even if a small number of men made it their lifes work to commit acts of sexual brutality they would not be able to chalk up the numbers involved so lets admit it once and for all way too many men abuse way too many women you cannot hide behind your smokescreen any longer get over your sulk and become part of the solution at

a colleague has two children a husband who is often away and a fulltime job last wednesday she had an evening meeting already postponed once the childminder was ill the neighbours au pair had a date crisis help was cobbled together via friends for that night at least now was that a parenting dilemma or more to do with the business of mothering and does the difference matter today the family and parenting institute fpi and the open university are holding a conference examining modern motherhood two studies will emphasise that unsurprisingly motherhood in the private realm is moulded by class income expectations aspirations family networks and support in the public domain however as the government has pushed mothers into work and encouraged dads into fathering as opposed to mainly breadwinning a conjuring trick has been performed motherhood now you see it now you dont motherhood has almost been erased from the lexicon of family policy instead mothers and fathers have been subsumed into one the genderneutral parent and that has already had an impact on the degree of support mothers receive why for instance has david cameron promised a significant increase in health visitors answer because theyve been drastically cut under labour women are forfeiting help with a range of issues including depression at a time when the identity of what it means to be a mother has never been more contradictory confusing and criticised again the government has increased spending on maternity services but report after report says having a child is still a health hazard sally gimson of the fpi in listening to mother making britain motherfriendly quotes department of work and pensions research showing that mothers wages stagnate for the first years of their return to work and then rise to only of the male wage thats not a parenting issue its a penalty of motherhood the lack of a public debate about mothering has other repercussions in britain successful pilots have been conducted on family nurse partnerships they offer mothers under a family nurse from early pregnancy until the child is two based on a us scheme the result is children who are healthier and more ready for school the uk version needs to be rolled out but with mothering camouflaged by the obsession with parenting politicians are handicapped when fighting for resources today we have parenting support workers parenting orders courses and parenting experts in these contexts doesnt parenting mostly mean mothering that is not to say that fatherhood is less important on the contrary references to genderneutral parenting does fathers no favours either feminists in the s saw motherhood as house arrest then mothers were at the cradle while fathers brought home the bacon now motherhood consists of a number of narratives yet the only two that receive media attention are the cartoon caricature of the yummy mummy and the naughty mummy two million mothers stay at home while the majority seven out of are in paid work some have no partner others are on their third or fourth some firsttime mothers are barely into puberty while others are nearing the menopause policy should reflect that diversity while tackling more vigorously the issues many mothers have in common parenting is a word that works hard to make raising a family a joint venture employed ubiquitously however it undermines the very assets that benefit a child most mothering and fathering can be equally important they may complement each other but politicians need reminding that they are not the same

if you had met some of the women who were suffragettes and suffragists you might feel differently about the falseness of the theatrical spectacle offered in her naked skin at the national theatre letters august and august in the s i arranged a colour photography session at the studio of adrian flowers for as many of the women who had been involved in the campaigns for womens voting rights as we could contact we invited them along for a colour group portrait to run in the observer with any banners they were able to bring although all were elderly they were a feisty bunch and astonished me with their political talent which i then wrote about above all they insisted that they had been much less interested in putting forward their own claims for recognition than in beginning reforms of the appalling social ills they observed i particularly remember one woman recounting that she had joined the movement after a picnic in the yorkshire countryside which had been surrounded by barefoot and hungry children child benefit paid to mothers so often disputed by male politicians was just one of the achievements of allowing women into the political sphere maureen green london marilyn finlay letters august says of her naked skin that the critics must have seen a different play i saw the same play as the critics it must be true that the suffrage movement placed a strain on marriages it may also be true that the passionate comradeship shared by the campaigning women may have found sexual expression but to place these elements at the core of the play to devote so much stage time to them completely unbalanced the drama these personal elements crowded the reforming campaign off the stage what happened to emmeline pankhursts speech in connecticut rightly classified by the guardian as among the great speeches of the th century booklet april these personal elements could have been placed in any context of upheaval using the suffrage movement as their setting was meretricious i was

i thought viv groskops article was excellent sex and the suffragette g august i too found the play her naked skin most disappointing not the staging which was admirable but the lack of content in fact the staging was so slick and the music so good that it only served to highlight the plays sterility as someone who has written on the subject of the suffrage movement indeed one of my books is acknowledged in the programme notes i could see that the plays author had done a modicum of research the facts as far as they went were not incorrect but what was the point of it to show risible scenes of lesbian sex and a forcedfeeding scene as groskop concludes surely the suffragettes deserve better than this they certainly did not deserve to be used as an opportunist vehicle on which to load all manner of modern baggage i left the theatre annoyed that the suffrage movement should have been travestied in this way incidentally i would welcome an explanation of the plays title i could find no reason for it other than its titillating appeal elizabeth crawford author of the womens suffrage movement a reference guide i agree strongly with most of viv groskops piece on her naked skin her disappointment at the missed opportunity her excitement at the dramatic staging of the piece and her bewilderment at the absence of any sense of what drives these women politically when this play features a group of women who were in reality so actively politically engaged as to put their lives on the line for their beliefs i would add my own bafflement at the decision to remove any reference to real figures like the pankhursts and the divisions they and others represented within the movement with sylvias activism united to socialism working with workingclass women in the east end while emmeline and christabel in the womens social and political union focused much more narrowly on votes for women suffragists rather than suffragettes meanwhile campaigned for the vote but rejected the use of civil disobedience while the womens freedom league had a broader analysis of womens oppression beyond the single issue of their exclusion from voting rebecca lenkiewiczs play represents the suffragettes as hanging up their banners to support the war on its outbreak in whereas sylvia pankhurst and her supporters campaigned against it if the national theatre did see itself as groskop suggests in the final paragraph as selling feminist theatre as a brand then the play it is selling is mislabelled there is no sense of the relationships being fuelled by the passion of ideas and ideals lived in a brilliant forge where radical social change seems a real possibility a missed opportunity indeed susan croft london,2008-08,thought viv groskops article wa excellent sex suffragette

emmeline and christabel in the womens social and political union focused much more narrowly on votes for women suffragists rather than suffragettes meanwhile campaigned for the vote but rejected the use of civil disobedience while the womens freedom league had a broader analysis of womens oppression beyond the single issue of their exclusion from voting rebecca lenkiewiczs play represents the suffragettes as hanging up their banners to support the war on its outbreak in whereas sylvia pankhurst and her supporters campaigned against it if the national theatre did see itself as groskop

rosie boycott has a habit of reinventing herself roughly once a decade she was a leading feminist in the s wrote a revealing memoir in the s and edited a glossy magazine and a new labourleaning newspaper in the s her various incarnations have always been remarkably in tune with the temper of the times so the latest one is looking rather worrying last month boycott wrote an article for the daily mail suggesting that women who have babies damage the finances of small businesses the clear implication was that it is risky to employ females of childbearing age in a similar piece elsewhere a couple of months previously shed fretted that feminism is turning out to be not a dream come true but a nightmare in another article this time in the guardian she seemed to recant her former hostility to domestic work and suggest women should all get back to the kitchen i travelled down to her house in somerset she also has a house in notting hill to try to find out what on earth is going on is boycott turning into a living warning against being too radical in youth for fear of becoming too conservative when you get older is she some kind of spooky zelig figure who cant help reflecting back the prevailing politics providing a bellwether of the coming new conservative order ive known rosie boycott on and off although not well since the s but when i visited her this week i hadnt seen her for years the first thing i noticed is that at and several years after a serious car accident that left her leg and foot permanently damaged she is as irrepressibly energetic as ever she has a tangle of blonde hair a husky voice from a lifetime of smoking and apparently endless enthusiasm she is passionate about her causes and you would have to be rather a cold fish not to find her engaging her circumstances on the other hand have altered quite a lot since we last met then she was a newspaper editor whisking about london glitzing about in literary and political circles now she is hanging over the gate of a house in a valley in jeans and a checked shirt she walks me round the garden and through the storybookstyle woodland she created during her convalescence from her accident she was drunk at the time of the crash driving on the a between her homes in somerset and london in her late twenties she was an alcoholic and wrote a funny and fiercely honest book about it a nice girl like me amy jenkins has recently done a screenplay the memoir itself is being reissued next year but she hadnt drunk for years until she lost her job as editor of the daily express and realised she says that shed been almost entirely externally defined by her job i had no sense of myself beyond that we sit and talk in the conservatory overlooking magnificent herbaceous borders among the basil plants that her husband charlie howard qc will later turn into pesto for our lunch localism and the countryside we are always being told will be important themes for camerons tories and heres rosie boycott living in the country growing her own vegetables picking her basil five minutes before its on the plate selling her eggs at nearby markets and writing a book spotted pigs and green tomatoes extolling the joys of running a smallholding coincidence or what now we learn that on september boycott will start work with boris as the mayors food tsar technically she will be chair of london food she is fanatical about this believing that food is far more important than fuel and has the potential to do a whole range of things from kickstarting environmental activism to solving social problems she claims she cant say much about the job yet but she doesnt really want to talk about anything else and keeps saying things like i plan to green every single space in london i can every roof i can creating vegetable gardens filling empty spaces before we get on to that though i want to get to the bottom of her apparent reservations about the legacy of feminism in her daily mail article she objected that while parental rights are a wonderful thing in theory beloved by governments eager to court the familyfriendly vote they are an immense burden on the small businesses who are expected to pick up the tab on her smallholding she went on she employs an incredibly attractive young woman in her thirties called sarah whose possible pregnancy she dreads the subtext here seems to be that young women are inevitably going to get knocked up especially if attractive if youre a hardpressed steward of the land you employ them at your peril when i visited sarah happily had so far avoided getting pregnant but boycott claimed her employee hadnt minded being publicly warned about the damaging possibilities of her childbearing decisions shes lovely it does seem odd though that boycott who founded the pioneering feminist magazine spare rib in at the age of appears to be prioritising the needs of business over the rights of women to choose how much time to take off paid work and it seems how shall we say rather unfair of her to have argued for reproductive rights when she was of the age to reproduce and for small business now thats become her new baby in fact she may have been unnecessarily fearful she seems surprised when i tell her that employers can recover per cent of the weeks statutory maternity pay whatever boycott claims she has been misunderstood she insists that what she was actually saying is that women are facing pressures caused by inequality what message are we sending out that a mans got entitlement to two weeks paternity leave and a womans got but wouldnt longer paternity leave just exacerbate the problems for small businesses we are going to need better tax breaks for small businesses i dont think theres enough help but i dont know how we do the next step of feminism i think when we started out we assumed women would have choices being a parent has been downgraded if i could go back i would have started fighting much sooner for tax relief for childcare for what its worth i think this is an example of why rosie boycott is such a brilliant campaigner she makes lots of points irrespective of whether some of them in some respects contradict others those of us who sit round worrying about the subtle implications of arguing x at the same time as y will probably never change anything boycott comes storming at you and the effect is that youre knocked sideways by her belief and the cumulative force of her arguments great campaigners tend to attract campaigns to them or to gravitate towards them aside from her championing of feminism boycott ran what was arguably the highestprofile newspaper campaign of recent times when she was at the independent on sunday to legalise cannabis now she says she is more in favour than ever of legalising all drugs as a trustee of the hay festival she is responsible for exporting its activities to colombia and she has seen for herself the devastation caused there by the worlds illegal drugs policy and the wests greed for cocaine she promises though that her current overriding passion her food and environment campaign will be her last this one is not going to go away in my lifetime on the other hand i do think were at a tipping point like when i started spare rib in the early seventies then we were pushing at a totally open door no one you went to could stand in your way i feel the same now about the environment and gardening we have lost connection with the land and growing and that has made people feel impotent my generation has had it easy my entire life has been created by cheap oil and that has given us an extraordinary amount of choice but all this convenience only seems to have made us more neurotic and isolated there is a feeling that we have become less resilient the mood is now swinging back in the opposite direction people are recognising that food is the great binder she reminds me that when monty don created a smallholding with a group of offenders and addicts he discovered that many of them had never eaten a meal round a table with other people and she talks about the cohesiveness of societies in southern europe their ability to share childcare across the generations which she sees as linked to a respect for food and the rituals of eating together i am sure shes right about this though it does seem a peculiar position for a person who once urged women not to learn either to type or cook domesticity was seen by the spare ribbers as shackling women boycotts own universityeducated mother had chafed all her life against the restrictions of being an army housewife reacting mulishly by serving a lot of fishfingers with ketchup the spare rib women were determined to make their own lives different early on in the magazines life they gave away a purple dishcloth printed with the words first you sink into his arms then your arms end up in his sink as things turned out all of us men included have had to learn to type and most of us have discovered that if we like eating and conviviality and feeding our children someone in the household has to care about cooking boycott now agrees cheerfully that dont type dont cook was crap advice and it was but also it wasnt because cooking takes time and theres no reason why women should always and inevitably be the ones to find it and although its difficult to pin her down about this one suspects if she had her child rearing newspaper editing years again she would not have spent much more of them in the kitchen boycott has a daughter daisy now from her first marriage to the journalist david leitch she also has two older stepchildren from that marriage and two adult stepchildren from her marriage in to charlie she split up with leitch another heavy drinker in he died years later as a single parent she had no choice but to work but she did not perhaps have to do so as obsessively as she did she admits she got over her addiction to drugs and drink largely by being a workaholic i wish i had seen more of my daughter one of the great lies we working parents tell ourselves is that we get home about the time that they get home from school but its not true i feel sad about it i wish there hadnt been so much seductive pressure but the truth is i loved work in the s i was having the best time of my life boycott has edited three newspapers in total the independent on sunday independent and express and in the process she put down an important marker this is a job women are capable of doing and a woman has as much right as a man to decide as she did that running a newspaper is about as thrilling as it gets life is messier than campaigners and trailblazers might like to think though almost inevitably now that shes immersed in it shes more aware of the value of domesticity im not saying that people not eating meals together is the cause of all social ills but if you eat meals together you talk to each other if you dont sit round a table you stop having a heart to things i know it sounds very cameroonian and i suppose it is which is not to say ive become a tory so dont say i have food has no politics carbon has no politics the new job at city hall came up after guto harri the mayors communications director heard boycott speaking at hay i am very interested in how we feed people in cities and the vulnerability of cities if for some reason all those lorries you see circling the m couldnt deliver food into london it would be a complete disaster within hours we are as someone said nine meals from anarchy she wants to get londoners thinking about food and about how long we want to cede responsibility for all that to multinationals she has a green grid plan to create allotment gardens in hospitals prisons schools and vacant lots there is she says an army already there lots of incredibly interesting small projects like whatif who grow plants in builders bags and install them in neglected spaces or the womens environmental network who have created gardens on housing estates in tower hamlets so that ethnic minority women can grow their own food and its interesting how many people with money seem keen to invest in this kind of thing everybody wants to feel on the side of the angels my job will be to raise the money for these groups and then say go of course you could spend ages dissecting the contradictions inherent in rosie boycotts positions she has been a feminist and the highly successful editor of a mens glossy an addict and a mother a small businesswoman and a campaigner for womens rights in the workplace by her own admission she is both enormously privileged and an old hippy she has an urban life and a country life it doesnt always all add up but that would be to miss the point of her boycott is an idealist effervescent and forceful her willingness to live out her life in the public eye may have been exposing but it has also made her effective oh and shes right the more allotments the better boycotts own

rosie boycott has a habit of reinventing herself roughly once a decade she was a leading feminist in the s wrote a revealing memoir in the s and edited a glossy magazine and a new labourleaning newspaper in the s her various incarnations have always been remarkably in tune with the temper of the times so the latest one is looking rather worrying last month boycott wrote an article for the daily mail suggesting that women who have babies damage the finances of small businesses the clear implication was that it is risky to employ females of childbearing age in a similar piece elsewhere a couple of months previously shed fretted that feminism is turning out to be not a dream come true but a nightmare in another article this time in the guardian she seemed to recant her former hostility to domestic work and suggest women should all get back to the kitchen i travelled down to her house in somerset she also has a house in notting hill to try to find out what on earth is going on is boycott turning into a living warning against being too radical in youth for fear of becoming too conservative when you get older is she some kind of spooky zelig figure who cant help reflecting back the prevailing politics providing a bellwether of the coming new conservative order ive known rosie boycott on and off although not well since the s but when i visited her this week i hadnt seen her for years the first thing i noticed is that at and several years after a serious car accident that left her leg and foot permanently damaged she is as irrepressibly energetic as ever she has a tangle of blonde hair a husky voice from a lifetime of smoking and apparently endless enthusiasm she is passionate about her causes and you would have to be rather a cold fish not to find her engaging her circumstances on the other hand have altered quite a lot since we last met then she was a newspaper editor whisking about london glitzing about in literary and political circles now she is hanging over the gate of a house in a valley in jeans and a checked shirt she walks me round the garden and through the storybookstyle woodland she created during her convalescence from her accident she was drunk at the time of the crash driving on the a between her homes in somerset and london in her late twenties she was an alcoholic and wrote a funny and fiercely honest book about it a nice girl like me amy jenkins has recently done a screenplay the memoir itself is being reissued next year but she hadnt drunk for years until she lost her job as editor of the daily express and realised she says that shed been almost entirely externally defined by her job i had no sense of myself beyond that we sit and talk in the conservatory overlooking magnificent herbaceous borders among the basil plants that her husband charlie howard qc will later turn into pesto for our lunch localism and the countryside we are always being told will be important themes for camerons tories and heres rosie boycott living in the country growing her own vegetables picking her basil five minutes before its on the plate selling her eggs at nearby markets and writing a book spotted pigs and green tomatoes extolling the joys of running a smallholding coincidence or what now we learn that on september boycott will start work with boris as the mayors food tsar technically she will be chair of london food she is fanatical about this believing that food is far more important than fuel and has the potential to do a whole range of things from kickstarting environmental activism to solving social problems she claims she cant say much about the job yet but she doesnt really want to talk about anything else and keeps saying things like i plan to green every single space in london i can every roof i can creating vegetable gardens filling empty spaces before we get on to that though i want to get to the bottom of her apparent reservations about the legacy of feminism in her daily mail article she objected that while parental rights are a wonderful thing in theory beloved by governments eager to court the familyfriendly vote they are an immense burden on the small businesses who are expected to pick up the tab on her smallholding she went on she employs an incredibly attractive young woman in her thirties called sarah whose possible pregnancy she dreads the subtext here seems to be that young women are inevitably going to get knocked up especially if attractive if youre a hardpressed steward of the land you employ them at your peril when i visited sarah happily had so far avoided getting pregnant but boycott claimed her employee hadnt minded being publicly warned about the damaging possibilities of her childbearing decisions shes lovely it does seem odd though that boycott who founded the pioneering feminist magazine spare rib in at the age of appears to be prioritising the needs of business over the rights of women to choose how much time to take off paid work and it seems how shall we say rather unfair of her to have argued for reproductive rights when she was of the age to reproduce and for small business now thats become her new baby in fact she may have been unnecessarily fearful she seems surprised when i tell her that employers can recover per cent of the weeks statutory maternity pay whatever boycott claims she has been misunderstood she insists that what she was actually saying is that women are facing pressures caused by inequality what message are we sending out that a mans got entitlement to two weeks paternity leave and a womans got but wouldnt longer paternity leave just exacerbate the problems for small businesses we are going to need better tax breaks for small businesses i dont think theres enough help but i dont know how we do the next step of feminism i think when we started out we assumed women would have choices being a parent has been downgraded if i could go back i would have started fighting much sooner for tax relief for childcare for what its worth i think this is an example of why rosie boycott is such a brilliant campaigner she makes lots of points irrespective of whether some of them in some respects contradict others those of us who sit round worrying about the subtle implications of arguing x at the same time as y will probably never change anything boycott comes storming at you and the effect is that youre knocked sideways by her belief and the cumulative force of her arguments great campaigners tend to attract campaigns to them or to gravitate towards them aside from her championing of feminism boycott ran what was arguably the highestprofile newspaper campaign of recent times when she was at the independent on sunday to legalise cannabis now she says she is more in favour than ever of legalising all drugs as a trustee of the hay festival she is responsible for exporting its activities to colombia and she has seen for herself the devastation caused there by the worlds illegal drugs policy and the wests greed for cocaine she promises though that her current overriding passion her food and environment campaign will be her last this one is not going to go away in my lifetime on the other hand i do think were at a tipping point like when i started spare rib in the early seventies then we were pushing at a totally open door no one you went to could stand in your way i feel the same now about the environment and gardening we have lost connection with the land and growing and that has made people feel impotent my generation has had it easy my entire life has been created by cheap oil and that has given us an extraordinary amount of choice but all this convenience only seems to have made us more neurotic and isolated there is a feeling that we have become less resilient the mood is now swinging back in the opposite direction people are recognising that food is the great binder she reminds me that when monty don created a smallholding with a group of offenders and addicts he discovered that many of them had never eaten a meal round a table with other people and she talks about the cohesiveness of societies in southern europe their ability to share childcare across the generations which she sees as linked to a respect for food and the rituals of eating together i am sure shes right about this though it does seem a peculiar position for a person who once urged women not to learn either to type or cook domesticity was seen by the spare ribbers as shackling women boycotts own universityeducated mother had chafed all her life against the restrictions of being an army housewife reacting mulishly by serving a lot of fishfingers with ketchup the spare rib women were determined to make their own lives different early on in the magazines life they gave away a purple dishcloth printed with the words first you sink into his arms then your arms end up in his sink as things turned out all of us men included have had to learn to type and most of us have discovered that if we like eating and conviviality and feeding our children someone in the household has to care about cooking boycott now agrees cheerfully that dont type dont cook was crap advice and it was but also it wasnt because cooking takes time and theres no reason why women should always and inevitably be the ones to find it and although its difficult to pin her down about this one suspects if she had her child rearing newspaper editing years again she would not have spent much more of them in the kitchen boycott has a daughter daisy now from her first marriage to the journalist david leitch she also has two older stepchildren from that marriage and two adult stepchildren from her marriage in to charlie she split up with leitch another heavy drinker in he died years later as a single parent she had no choice but to work but she did not perhaps have to do so as obsessively as she did she admits she got over her addiction to drugs and drink largely by being a workaholic i wish i had seen more of my daughter one of the great lies we working parents tell ourselves is that we get home about the time that they get home from school but its not true i feel sad about it i wish there hadnt been so much seductive pressure but the truth is i loved work in the s i was having the best time of my life boycott has edited three newspapers in total the independent on sunday independent and express and in the process she put down an important marker this is a job women are capable of doing and a woman has as much right as a man to decide as she did that running a newspaper is about as thrilling as it gets life is messier than campaigners and trailblazers might like to think though almost inevitably now that shes immersed in it shes more aware of the value of domesticity im not saying that people not eating meals together is the cause of all social ills but if you eat meals together you talk to each other if you dont sit round a table you stop having a heart to things i know it sounds very cameroonian and i suppose it is which is not to say ive become a tory so dont say i have food has no politics carbon has no politics the new job at city hall came up after guto harri the mayors communications director heard boycott speaking at hay i am very interested in how we feed people in cities and the vulnerability of cities if for some reason all those lorries you see circling the m couldnt deliver food into london it would be a complete disaster within hours we are as someone said nine meals from anarchy she wants to get londoners thinking about food and about how long we want to cede responsibility for all that to multinationals she has a green grid plan to create allotment gardens in hospitals prisons schools and vacant lots there is she says an army already there lots of incredibly interesting small projects like whatif who grow plants in builders bags and install them in neglected spaces or the womens environmental network who have created gardens on housing estates in tower hamlets so that ethnic minority women can grow their own food and its interesting how many people with money seem keen to invest in this kind of thing everybody wants to feel on the side of the angels my job will be to raise the money for these groups and then say go of course you could spend ages dissecting the contradictions inherent in rosie boycotts positions she has been a feminist and the highly successful editor of a mens glossy an addict and a mother a small businesswoman and a campaigner for womens rights in the workplace by her own admission she is both enormously privileged and an old hippy she has an urban life and a country life it doesnt always all add up but that would be to miss the point of her boycott is an idealist effervescent and forceful her willingness to live out her life in the public eye may have been exposing but it has also made her effective oh and shes right the more allotments the better boycotts own

the spark is the prime mover the thing that gets things started universes prairie fires unstoppable revolutions and passionate loves are ignited by sparks but no one is quite sure how the cosmic spark

like a jewelbedecked queen of the orient without having to have an oppressive and hierarchical social structure in place to facilitate the mining cutting and polishing of rare gems women also look for a sparkle in men not in their jewellery but in their eyes a sparklyeyed man can laugh any woman into bed a woman can also laugh any man out of bed but thats a different story humans like magpies are attracted to things that sparkle from rubies on their fingers to metallic paint on their audis in a restaurant you always feel you should choose sparkling water because it sounds much more exciting and glamorous even though you know it will make you belch like a volcano sparkling champagne somehow suggests youre more successful just by drinking it our love of sparkling is intimately bound up with sun worship sparkling snow and sparkling sea look so good because they are being kissed by the sun fake tan is an attempt by humans to look similarly sunkissed but the impression given tends more towards mud worship the opposite of sparkling is matt black goths tend to fight shy of wearing any kind of sequin although if theyre not careful the sun can sparkle merrily off their line of ear piercings the tragic decline of elvis was marked by the migration of the sparkle from his eyes to the rhinestones on his jumpsuit far worse than having no sparkle is losing your sparkle old cola morecambe black holes and the greek royal family theyve all lost their sparkle and nothings flatter than that sparks have their dark sides most sparks never become a flame they do nothing but

the unexpected advantage of the silly season is that there is also space for some serious stuff to escape from the thinktanks for a few deep breaths of the oxygen of publicity this august a series of research findings on the status of women at work has produced some conflicting results that need thought how is it that the skills minister david lammy in this weeks new statesman can point to the growing demand for soft skills emotional and intellectual rather than physical strength and a yorkshire building society survey can argue that the work women do in the home should be valued at a year while tuc research into vulnerable workers found that at the bottom of the lowpaid pile were newly arrived migrant women a partial answer is given in an analysis by the office of national statistics released last tuesday which simply said that twothirds of the gender pay gap remains unexplained discrimination by employers plus womens motivation and qualifications were put up as reasons although with girls outperforming boys at school and increasingly at university the latter seems unlikely it is the relevance of qualifications that may be more of a problem according to the ons which found that manufacturing jobs and apprenticeships remain a largely male preserve earlier this month there was a flurry of excitement about the death of the supermum a s media myth who held down a top job cooked souffls and coached the kids in maths all at the same time most women will be truly grateful at her demise presumably from exhaustion supermums were invented by men who did not want to do the hoovering misguidedly egged on by women with no sense of sisterly solidarity but the heart of the report by the cambridge sociologist jacqueline scott was that in britain and the us there was a growing concern that family life suffered when mothers worked even though it is ever more widely accepted that men are not the sole bread winners in fact workplace equality and the expectation that both mothers and fathers go out to work has never had such extensive support in the latest british social attitudes survey only thought men should be the main earners cultural attitudes reinforced by economic pressures like the cost of buying a home are not in retreat at all the assumption that everyone wins is last month nicola brewer who as chief executive of the new equalities commission might be expected to champion change warned that legislation might actually be counterproductive discouraging employers from taking on women of childbearing age and most significantly confirming the prejudice that mothers are the main carers there is anecdotal evidence that nonmothers as well as some employers feel the legislation that from gives mothers a years paid maternity leave the second half of which can be shared with the father has gone too far yet almost every aspect of working and home life is still framed to make it harder for mothers as the campaigning organisation fawcett points out most jobs are still manshaped long hours fulltime intensive making demands that can only be met by someone without immutable outside commitments while the women who would like them to be shaped differently still get sacked when they get pregnant at a rate of about a year change will only come slowly meanwhile the home is still womanshaped fourfifths of mothers work but they still do twothirds of the chores and most of the parenting maybe that is why the growing concern about the impact on the family professor scott identified is more marked among men no clean socks in the drawer than women meanwhile the state still hesitates about engaging fully in providing the support that families most need but in the end equality needs more than government policy to make it happen it

peaches geldof has really done it now just when you thought the overdose headlines would send her into hiding she married the guy shes been dating for a month father bob has reportedly either given his full support or is apoplectic we can imagine which is closer to the truth but hes a wise old soul sir bob and when he recovers from the shock he should reflect on the plus points of young love growing up in dublin i was about peachess age when i first saw bob on irelands famous late late show he was everything seventies ireland was not outrageous iconoclastic profane his love for thengirlfriend paula was overtly sexual as a hormonal teen surrounded by ubiquitous catholic iconography they embodied my fantasy life with role models such as them no wonder peaches right felt she

do everything together even after years if peaches and max take heed they may just stand a chance it may be prudent to recall britney and both her weddings one a vegas ceremony followed by annulment hours later the other couple bearing a worrying resemblance is amy and blake the analogy summons cold comfort however peaches was born into celebrity and must be analysed accordingly celeb marriage

instead of ending her piece and i cant speak mandarin chinese either rachel cooke mothers are to blame for this childobsessed society of ours comment last week should have written and i have an extremely wellpaid job im fed up with articles about rich or middleclass women and their indulged children whose decision to return to work is primarily based on how much their or their partners job pays how about an article on the plight of children from the bottom of the social pile who are not indulged by anyone as their often single parents nearly invariably women are either forced to live on meagre state benefits or encouraged to return to pitifully paid jobs by ever more reactionary british governments austin radford dordogne france rachel cooke has missed the most significant factor in our preoccupation with children in our society it is not the relationship between working mothers or any other mothers for that matter and their childrens needs it is much more the power and influence of the advertisers who have fastened on to a lucrative and constantly replenished market for all the unnecessary rubbish that surround the raising of children i would suggest you learn mandarin ms cooke and forget about children if your belief is that a fiveminute bedtime story does it all joyce brand leintwardine herefordshire it was i think gloria steinem who said that she had yet to hear someone ask a man how he combined parenthood and a career this is a survey about what people believe not what is actually the case and i do not understand why fellow academics go on asking this question it is profoundly depressing that the observer continues to perpetuate a misogynist and outdated debate with a hiatus for the postwar generation british mothers have always been either economically active andor able to pay for childcare the view that the lack of a y chromosome confers a moral obligation to immure oneself with small children comes from the fifties and is best left there dr sarah moss lecturer in english and american literature university of kent at canterbury the reason the mother on the bus allowed her child to take the seat cooke had given up for a pensioner was because she was inconsiderate and apparently did not know any better it had nothing to do with whether the mother worked or not instead of spending the next minutes watching the child occupying her seat why didnt she point out to the mother the error of her ways kevin jones ermington devon rachel cooke betrays herself and her prejudice by her bus narrative is it women careers families or children she is really concerned with might it have been more appropriate for her to inquire of the childs health before using this one dubious nonepisode as the basis for a word assumption there is similarly no evidence that a yearold mother with apparently flashy mobile is anything other than a normal working or nonworking mother or aunt or childminder or stepmother there has never been anything like a childobsessed society in britain and thanks to cooke et al there never will be might it be more profitable for an observer writer to examine how those countries with child obsessions in their culture planning and public services also make provision for the frail and elderly lewis jones llantrisant wales reminds me of an anecdote when i was a child my father got the best pieces of

call me cynical if you will but i wasnt surprised by yesterdays news that some rape victims have had their compensation payments reduced by the criminal injuries compensation authority cica simply because theyd had a bit to drink prior to the crime its not like its the first time ive ever heard this particular rape myth the one that says that inebriated women are somehow partly responsible for their own rapes indeed its the same tired argument thats used against those irresponsible and feckless women who choose to dress provocatively or who dare to walk about unchaperoned after dark in fact against any woman ever who isnt able to prove to the world that shes led a totally blamefree and virginal life lets face it if youre a woman and youre one of the nearly a year whos brave enough to report a sex crime committed against you someone somewhere will find a reason to argue that it was all your fault and yet people still wonder why tens of thousands more women choose not to report these assaults no the only thing that surprised me about this story was that the womanblamer in this instance was a body thats accountable to the government for the way it spends its money and id only just finished reading about how tackling rape is one of the top priorities for the ministers for women in light of their decision to reverse this insult and to pay the women the money to which they were entitled ill give cica the benefit of the doubt this time and assume that that message hadnt quite filtered its way down yet the progress report pdf issued by the ministers for women last month doesnt really tell us that much about whats being done about the endemic levels of rape and sexual violence in this country despite the fact that the ministers stated priority is tackling violence against women and improving the treatment of women who commit crimes the only real progress the document mentions in relation to tackling rape is the m in emergency funding that was pledged in march to ensure that no more rape crisis centres would be forced to close well not this year at least the report also talks about the governments commitment to increasing the numbers of sexual assault referral centres sarcs but as ive mentioned in a previous article on this issue these centres are set up to deal with victims in the immediate aftermath of an assault and offer no services to women coping with the long termeffects of rape on their lives rape crisis centres on the other hand provide support and services to any woman who has experienced rape be it last week last year or indeed years ago as always there appear to be a lot of good intentions and a lot of stated aims in the report about the ministers being committed to making things better for women but practically speaking it offers very little beyond the same old same old empty words and false optimism for without a significant financial investment in rape crisis and other womens sector organisations theres only limited scope for improvement and apart from this years emergency monies theres little sign of any future or more longterm funding meanwhile the stopgap funding is coming to an end and once more organisations providing vital services to women are left wondering how on earth theyre going to manage when that money runs out but at least its not just me and a few feminist activists who are getting frustrated by the lack of progress on this issue now even the un have announced that theyre fed up with the current state of affairs in a recent report pdf by the committee for the elimination of discrimination against women cedaw a number of serious government failings have been cited including the lack of sustainable funding for womens voluntary and community organisations specifically rape crisis centres as sheila coates and lee eggleston pointed out in the new statesman the cedaw committee heavily criticised the uk for being in breach of key elements of the un convention the cedaw report states for example that the committee is concerned about the continuing prevalence of violence against women and girls including domestic and sexual violence and about the low prosecution and conviction rates of sexual violence cases the committee remains concerned about the absence of a comprehensive national strategy and programme to combat all forms of violence against women and girls the committee notes with concern the lack of adequate support and services for victims including shelters which is compounded by the funding crisis facing nongovernmental organizations working in the area of violence against women and the forced closures of a number of such organizations it goes on to say the committee calls on the state party to ensure the full implementation of legislation on violence against women as well as the prosecution and conviction of perpetrators the committee recommends the expansion of training activities and programmes for parliamentarians the judiciary and public officials particularly law enforcement personnel and healthservice providers so as that they are sensitized to all forms of violence against women and can provide adequate support to victims it recommends the expansion of public awarenessraising campaigns on all forms of violence against women and girls the committee also recommends the establishment of additional counselling and other support services for victims of violence including shelters and requests the state party to enhance its cooperation with and support in particular adequate and sustained funding for nongovernmental organizations working in the area of violence against women thats right adequate and sustained funding for nongovernmental organisations working in the area of violence against women so wheres the money harriet vera anyone the government has until to respond to the un and to explain what changes it has made in the time between now and then to ensure it adheres pdf more fully to the convention the ministers for women on the other hand have got until this time next year when theyll no doubt be publishing yet another progress report but whats clear from both yesterdays guardian editorial and the cedaw report is that the situation as it stands must not be allowed to continue women and girls deserve better than this they deserve better than to be blamed for the crimes committed against them they deserve better than the current postcode lottery of inadequately funded services and most of all they deserve justice it looks like the ministers have a busy few years ahead,2008-08,call cynical wasnt surprised yesterday news rape victim compensation payment reduced criminal injury compensation authority cica simply theyd bit drink prior crime like first time ive ever heard particular rape myth one say inebriated

read come to mine his replies were always the same no first he had jet lag then he was working third he was out with friends and i hadnt wanted to join them four was a repeat number three and so on so i started chasing up the text replies with the odd phone call and another and another it seemed perfectly reasonable honest even in my foggy mind but i discovered that however tiresome the traditional chase binning the rulebook is a gamble a friend of mine was on the receiving end of a similar relationship activist lesbian friend so frustrated by the constant calls from her fling changed her number fling with an attitude started calling her at the office first under her real name then using fakes finally fwaa pretended to be alfs mother so alf took out a restraining order i sympathized with my friend of course but like her fling the more i texted and was turned down however reasonable the reason the more neurotic i grew finally banker sets another date we dont even kiss this time a quick drink to catch up then back to his to sleep im half asleep when i feel a dead weight rolling on me and instead of pushing him off im grateful at least he wants me i decide were kissing and after a while i say something about getting a condom no response i think he doesnt hear me so i say it again but he carries on and when hes finished he rolls off and goes to sleep im awake all night the next morning i shower before am he wakes up and says youre all damp like a fucking frog so i get dressed then i say something about going to a clinic getting a pill its sunday drizzling and hes got a car he says im busy today im going to the gym got to do a bit of weeding so i kiss him and leave i walk three miles to a pharmacy i queue up and explain in front of a line of people what i need i pay for

women suffer from a disproportionate amount of violence poverty and disease and while this is often the result of warfare or civil unrest genderbased security threats exists even where white flags have been raised for many years perhaps it is an issue of semantics as the word security has traditionally applied only to armed conflict and weapons of mass destruction yet persistent mass destruction of the health livelihood and personal safety of women occurs everyday throughout the world some of the worlds poorest people characterised as those living on less than a day are women women have lower incomes often for the same job throughout the world million women are not expected to live past the age of in large part the result of povertyrelated illness and genderbased violence current trends in european homes and workplaces highlight the fact that womens security transcends geographical boundaries between developing and developed countries financial and emotional security threats continue to affect european women on a daily basis europes paygap remains an enduring source of such insecurity with women earning on average less than men in germany where childcare facilities are available for only one in six children women often cannot afford highpriced daycare alternatives and are forced to give up their jobs in the uk women make up of all singleparent households putting them at a higher risk of enduring poverty these things inherently decrease the amount of security for women and their children the united nations security council has taken great strides in acknowledging these issues adopting resolution in and expanding upon it in june with resolution which classifies rape as a war crime in official terms these resolutions note the importance of womens security in its many forms resolution especially emphasises the need for womens participation in peace negotiations and conflict resolution recognising the large impact of conflict on women in particular these documents have been heralded by many groups as crucial in the struggle for gender equality in security issues but as we have seen countless times in the international political arena change requires action a declaration faces the unfortunate possibility of being merely ink on paper unless people from every level in governmental bodies and civil society organisations become advocates for the tangible steps needed to elicit such change specifically resolution calls upon member states to ensure increased representation of women at all decisionmaking levels in national regional and international institutions and mechanisms for the prevention management and resolution of conflict yet women remain underrepresented in precisely these fields the image of carme chacn spains defence minister inspecting troops while pregnant has become an international symbol of women breaking free from genderbased stereotypes yet the notion of a woman in charge of national security remains unusual in march this year i attended a conference entitled women stabilising an insecure world where women leaders from around the globe came together to discuss the need for change in the end we signed a call for action urging leaders everywhere to ensure that women are actively engaged in local national and international decisionmaking we noted the importance of women in peace processes and areas of military conflict but also acknowledged the need for female decisionmakers in all countries at all levels with this in mind i am disappointed to see that only seven european union member states have adopted national action plans toward the implementation of resolution it may well be the case that in a region without widespread civil wars or armed militias countries in europe have not prioritised resolution however having concrete national provisions for gender equality in security extends beyond peace negotiations and conflict resolution womens participation in security decisionmaking will inherently improve the functioning of political bodies by making them more representative and democratic democracy means including societal stakeholders excluding women from security decisionmaking is like excluding half of all stakeholders but beyond the intrinsic benefits of womens representation in decisionmaking national action plans can provide the tools for gender equality in areas other than security economic development and sustainable growth are both deeply linked to security and are areas on which women can introduce unique perspectives there can be no sustainable development without an equitable development and there can be no equitable development without gender equality on a more fundamental level national action plans towards gender equality would prioritise womens participation at the highest echelons of politics making women not only visible but also audible we have seen examples from around the world where when such womens audibility is ensured society benefits groups like the northern ireland womens coalition helped broker the good friday agreement and work toward a ceasefire in chile womens peace organisations were crucial in building a stable society following almost years of dictatorship today chile has its first woman president michelle bachelet and yet women remain underrepresented in brokering such stability pacts and peace accords when asked what she thought of colombias current state of conflict newly rescued hostage ngrid betancourt did not need time to contemplate the question she responded that while prominent politicians in her country thought that violence caused social problems she believed the reverse was true social issues such as poverty and illness propel people into violence and conflict but voices expressing the realities of the unbreakable link between poverty disease and violence are altogether missing from the security field it is perhaps no coincidence that such voices are often womens voices un resolution has served as an important step in addressing issues of womens security and women in security but more needs to be done i call upon eu member states to prioritise this resolution through national action plans in doing so we will take a crucial step toward accounting not only for womens security but the most basic human security,2008-08,woman suffer disproportionate amount

nicola brewer chief executive of the equalities and human rights commission recently suggested that improved maternity benefits entitling new mothers to a years leave have resulted in some bosses considering female staff a liability but the problem could be worse than she suspects changes to the sex discrimination act passed in april have created confusion over whether employers should maintain pension contributions during the entire month period of maternity leave legal experts believe they should but the government contradicts this view the amendments to the sex discrimination act made it discriminatory for employers to withdraw contractual noncash benefits such as medical insurance mobile phones and company cars during maternity leave for women whose babies are due to be born on or after october employees both full and parttime who are pregnant or have just given birth are entitled to a maximum of weeks statutory maternity pay smp regardless of whether they intend to return to work however to qualify they must have worked for their employer for a continuous period of at least weeks into the th week before the week the baby is due and be earning an average of at least a week before tax all employees are entitled to take an additional weeks maternity leave but are not guaranteed any pay unless it says so in their contract of employment however while it is clear that noncash benefits must now be continued throughout maternity leave there is some controversy about how pension contributions should be treated catrin young a pensions specialist with solicitors tlt says the confusion relates to the interpretation of the part of the sex discrimination act that allows employers to stop paying remuneration during unpaid maternity leave the act defines remuneration as benefits that consist of the payment of money to an employee by way of wages or salary the question therefore is whether pension contributions can be classed as wagessalary or benefits there are strong legal arguments that pension contributions are neither wages nor salary and are a benefit which should therefore be continued through the entire weeks of maternity leave if you were to ask the man on the street whether they considered their employers pension contributions to be wages or a benefit im sure the majority would consider it a benefit however this is not the view of the government department responsible for maternity policy the department for business enterprise amp regulatory reform berr which says that pensions do count as remuneration a spokesman for berr says the changes will not affect pension costs the changes relate to nonpaid rights throughout maternity leave which include benefits such as company cars gym memberships or other workrelated benefits pensions are considered a paid right this means that when a woman is taking additional maternity leave but is not being paid the employer is not required to make pension payments for her during this time simon briault deputy head of public affairs at the federation of small businesses acknowledges that extending maternity rights is in principle a good thing but is concerned that small businesses are having to shoulder a disproportionate financial burden he estimates that if companies do have to extend pension contributions for new mothers it will cost them millions of pounds this year the government is continually increasing the financial burden on small businesses and it needs to provide more help he warns greg campbell a partner in the employment group at law firm mishcon de reya agrees that the extension to maternity rights does represent an increased cost for employers as they will have to continue to provide certain benefits that could previously be suspended during additional maternity leave and unlike statutory maternity pay this is a cost that comes entirely out of the employers bank account he adds that the complexity of the legislation and the confusion it is causing could also expose employers to the added cost of litigation tlts young agrees unless and until the sex discrimination act is amended to explicitly state that pension contributions are remuneration employers run the risk of claims for sex discrimination if they stop making pension contributions through unpaid maternity leave ultimately the uncertainty will continue until a case on the point is brought before the employment tribunals were that to happen the tribunal could look to a line of case law in the european court of justice which supports the argument that accrual of pension under an occupational pension scheme is a benefit and not pay until that time employers are left with the difficult decision of choosing between taking the safe but expensive approach of amending their pensionscheme rules and employment policies to ensure that pension benefits continue for the entire weeks of maternity leave or waiting for legal clarification and thereby risking a sex discrimination claim it may be of little consolation to employers but zoe lynch of law firm sackers says the confusion could be eradicated by a further extension to statutory maternity pay the promised extension of smp to cover the whole of a womans maternity leave the full year means that the issue as a whole may have a limited shelflife to the end of the current parliament which is probably no more than a year jasmins benefits jasmin ahmad head of modern languages at an innerlondon secondary school is expecting her second child in the first week of november and plans to take a years maternity leave as she has agreed to return to work her benefits are slightly better than smp which is paid for weeks if she fails to return all contractual maternity pay must be repaid though she could keep the smp if entitled to smp a woman can receive per cent of her average earnings for the first six weeks then up to for the remaining weeks the last weeks if taken are unpaid i made the decision to go parttime after my daughter was born she is now three explains jasmin having a family will inevitably lead to a drop in my income even if my union has managed to negotiate better

a couple of weeks ago i took a trip on a bus when i got on it near my home it was empty and i managed to get a seat twenty minutes later though it was standing room only at which point my conscience got the better of me seeing that a group of pensioners was about to board i stood up in order that one of them might take my place it was then that something appalling happened the woman standing next to me about mobile phone in one hand impressively expensivelooking handbag in the other flashed me a smile thank you she said and then turning to the small child beside her there you go sweetheart oh my god was this really happening yes it was for minutes i watched openmouthed as a sevenyearold in pink sneakers sat merrily in my seat swinging her legs to the tune she was humming under her breath while all about her adults many of them very frail adults and one of them her own no doubt weary mother uncomplainingly hung on for dear life as their morning ride ploughed round another tootight city corner i thought of sneaker girl as i read about the cambridge university report published last week which seems to suggest that support for gender equality is falling according to the research by its author jacqueline scott in per cent of british men and per cent of women agreed with the proposition that a family does not suffer if a women is in fulltime employment by however the figures had fallen to per cent of men and per cent of women thanks to sneaker girl i was not surprised by these figures thanks to her too i was not taken in by the likes of the fawcett society which fell back on patronising old instincts and clich when it announced that the survey shows how attempts to shoehorn women into workplaces made by men for men have failed does it really this survey does not herald a return to traditionalism the same research boasts another set of figures ones not so widely quoted in the scare stories which show that since the proportion of those who believe it is the husbands job to earn income and the wifes to look after the children has almost halved neither has it much to do with jacqueline scotts suggestion that the shine of the supermum is wearing off only a few glossy magazine editors believed in her in the first place no this is about children in a world in which a child is always deemed the most important person in the room or bus in which their desires must always be satisfied their grievances negotiated in high un style and their putative skills nurtured like so many hothouse seedlings there is simply no time for the adults around them to leave the house and since work generally involves leaving the house someone is going to have to stay indoors sure that this someone is more likely to be female than male might be due to good oldfashioned sexism but this is not to say there isnt an element of choice in this mothers no one is forcing you to make sure that by the time your child is nine years old he will be incapable of amusing himself for more than five seconds as a childless woman of im not really entitled to have opinions about these things this much is often made clear to me i dont understand but im afraid i do when women have children they divide into two those who try to carry on much as they did before and those who change so much as to be unrecognisable the first group throws the second into pretty stark relief when a woman tells me she is just not willing to sacrifice her children on the altar of work i have only to think of friends who have kept working and whose children seem to be happy and functioning to feel not only suspicious of her motives but insulted on the part of those she is implicitly criticising and who may not have the luxury of choice i think of my own mother who always worked the fact that she had a job never bothered me it was the fact and this really was due to sexism that she had a job she hated that i disliked i didnt want her to be thwarted then i wonder when we started fetishising children perhaps in the beginning it was guilt we worked therefore we compensated some women started having children later and were thus more grateful at their arrival but its gone way beyond such things now beyond reason and beyond good manners when i was small my parents often told me to go off and amuse myself these days say be quiet im reading to a child and its tantamount to abuse once children were discouraged from interrupting adults now adults leap on their chat in the way i imagine george henry lewes used to leap on george eliot whenever she emerged from her study manuscript in hand youre midanecdote with your dear longlost girlfriend when little balthazar comes up and says something like you know that dog where does he live does he live on television and thereafter even if you announced you were dating a cabinet minister or about to join a lesbian order of nuns in kuala lumpur it wouldnt make any difference conversationally speaking youre chopped liver the one gambit that would return you to centre stage of course would be to announce you were pregnant but its tricky to lie about that one isnt it professor scotts research is telling us something but what that something is has precious little to do with whether most women are capable of need or want careers what constitutes family life exactly and what do we mean when we say it is suffering one persons ideal family life is anothers claustrophobia when jacqueline scott says that the idea of women juggling highpowered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is unrealisable what is her point a bedtime story takes five minutes the rest is hardly necessary to a womans or a childs happiness in all the maddeningly futile coverage of this survey ive read no one has bothered to flip this thing on its head and point out that workplace discrimination and a childobsessed society are entirely different things so allow me one hurts women and society and being historical is unchosen we must wipe it out the other alas is entirely chosen the result of a middleclass competitiveness that considers mandarin classes just another notch on the ikea yardstick of aspiration as for the misleading headlines on reports of this survey two into one dont go families suffer if mother works they are just more evidence that sometimes we write the stories we want to read perception is

we asked whether it is possible for modern mothers to combine childcare with a career had our panel made free choices in their own lives or had they felt pressured is there such a thing as a supermum and does superdad exist frances young mothers have got a lot of pressure on them these days theyre pushed to go back to work and childcare child minders theyre very expensive joy i moved to within a mile of my mother so she does a very traditional oldfashioned grandparenting role my friends say youre so lucky and i say well i moved specifically for this one reason its a difficult thing where lots of people have moved to london to have their careers and they start their families in a city and your parents are elsewhere debbie i would have carried on working if id had someone closer because the thought of going off every day and leaving her at a nursery is hard ann when me and frances were growing up we raised our kids and it wasnt an option for my mum to have our children so we went to our early morning cleaning jobs night cleaning jobs and whatever working the school hours there wasnt free daycare available or the money that could be earned to pay for daycare debbie the problem nowadays is the cost i went back four days a week it was a month for my child to go to nursery thats a second mortgage we made the decision because it definitely impacted on our family life and on my wellbeing that i was going to stop working claire the problem with that is that the government sees the solution as giving money to get women back into work rather than giving money to support the women at home i find the friends of mine who do work i cant see any problems with their children whatsoever but their husbands are available to help a lot more as a single mother you dont have that option but it can work if youve got a supportive partner whos able to at least do part of the workload elisca its wrong to talk about the supermum theres always going to be a superparent and within a relationship one of you has to be careerorientated and the other person has to be more flexible but why is there such a sexist notion that men are providers not able to provide something occasionally i have pangs of missing out on moments but if you have children you have to be prepared to compromise society has to address the fact that there are some superdads out there who are brilliant and not working claire one of the issues is that you sometimes have couples where neither is the superparent because theyre both out at work all the time some of the research says that between seven months and a year the separation anxiety is quite strong but its such a hot potato that you cant ever mention the possibility that there may be some less good options in looking after children because its such an important part of who you are as a mother that youre doing the best for your child that to imply that someone else isnt is completely offlimits i dont think you can ever have a straight debate about it elisca my husband still works but i think we discussed it and recognised that one definitely has to be more flexible in terms of being ambitious or putting in the extra hours or having to say ive got to go home now for the kids debbie but then you have to be in a job where you can do that that allows you to do that and there are some professions that are more accommodating than others elisca my husband actually changed his job he earns a little bit less money but it allows him to have the flexibility to always be able to be there for our children if necessary elspeth did you work out who was the better nurturer and who had the better potential earning and did you juggle that elisca yes although i think hes actually better at it parenting to a certain extent because hes more patient than me is it true we asked that family life suffers if the mother has a fulltime job if so how and what parts of family life or is the problem not with working mothers but with how mothers are expected to work joy my parents worked six and eventually seven days a week each i saw my parents on sundays my mother would be home to put me to bed and my father would take me to school but i was in theory one of the kids who was suffering actually i had a perfectly happy childhood my parents had put in place relatively stable childcare i always knew where they were if i really wanted them and i grew up to love and respect my parents i wonder whether modern society has got this great idea about how much a woman should be doing in terms of nurturing a child and whether your child actually needs all the things that the national childbirth trust says your child needs or whether your child just needs a roof over their head they must know where their parents are they need food on the table they need consistent love but actually other people can look after them and they turn out fine liz i felt quite privileged that i was a woman when the children were small because it was more acceptable for a woman to say that she wanted to work part time my husband would very much have liked to work part time while i went out to work full time he worked in it in the city and the idea was just completely unacceptable hed just have had to resign ann i think what the mothers go through is a guilt suffering because now the childminding and daycare are a very big business and theres just not that little bit more care put into it aruna when i had mine we used to get six to seven weeks maternity leave but now more modern mums need to breastfeed until eight or nine months claire there are so many small businesses in this country that its going to be really harsh on them to have people disappearing for six months at a time on a whim when the mothers can take the time off i dont think the onus should be on bosses to fund childcare effectively to fund the dads having time off as well as the mothers elspeth before we got married we agreed that i was going to stay at home and it turned out that my salary would have been greater than my husbands but we decided that i was going to do a better job than him and we have gone through times where we havent had enough money for things but thats the decision that we chose to make elisca so is the debate not necessarily can supermums exist but are children affected by both parents working as opposed to one parent working i think thats the great thing that needs to be discussed and is it going to be always women that are seen as almost the bad parent for choosing to go back to work its almost like they all seem to think they ought to be the ones who are staying at home elspeth theres something very interesting youre raising as well about how much of a choice it is to go back to work do you work because youve really chosen to because you need the money and you didnt have any other choices or because you needed the money to maintain a certain standard of living debbie a lot of it is down to women feeling that they need to do it all and maybe not being great at sharing it with their partners were not always great at asking for help because you think if you ask for help it means you cant do it all from the school gate to the boardroom everyone seems to have an opinion on modern motherhood do they feel that theres one way mothers should be going about the job we asked our panel if they feel judged on their life choices and by whom debbie everyone claire i feel theres judgment out there between the working mums and the nonworking mums if another mum asked me whether i work or not i immediately want to know what their situation is its like a secret society being at home full time because if you say youre at home full time to a working mum i feel they think im judging them for working you feel that the expectation is that you should be working and if you are at home full time its because youre so incredibly wealthy and indolent laughter it is really tempting to say im at home full time but i had a very interesting job i used to travel round the world and i had a life ann its not all that much fun being at home all the time its a really really hard job elspeth the judgment comes from women i feel judged because ive got a degree and im not using it id just like everyone to have the choice and its like the government is happy to pay anyone to look after my children except me im actually very angry its not that i need the money from them but i feel the government is saying well youre not worth much debbie you dont qualify for loads of tax breaks we got a little bit of working family tax credit but because i stay at home now we dont qualify for that wait a minute my husband still works his backside off and im working hard at home when my second daughter goes to school i will probably retrain as a teacher because that is more childfriendly i certainly would never go back into what i was doing because it was a young work hard play hard environment joy it changes your set of ambitions doesnt it if you notice a lot of women who dont have children going up the career rung you realise theres no way you can get on that career ladder debbie well you dont necessarily want to joy part of me wants to part of me is never really going to be happy doing that because i cant do everything so at some point you just let a bit of ambition go even though ive got a degree but you think well im just going to kill myself if i try and do it all elisca when children are young as long as theyre being loved whether its through extensive family contacts or really good childminders or a great nursery where theyre learning social skills if its not you and its someone else thats providing that love and care i think they get as great as you can give them yourselves so i think you can work full time and still be familyorientated and make sure youve got time for your children at weekends its when that aspect is missing and people tend to absolve the responsibility of children handing them over to the childminders or the school to make them good little people thats where i think problems sometimes arise joy the other thing is the way you have to work when you do a fulltime job you dont just go nine to five you really have to work sort of or hours and when you come home youre tired and so the way you look after your children when youre tired is not constructive last weeks headlines proclaimed the death of supermum the mythical creature juggling a supersonic career with baking cookies we asked who are the real supermums and dads did the have it all mother ever exist debbie no you read these articles about these women and you think my god how have they done it well theyve done it because they sat with the baby in the baby bouncer while they were typing on the computer something always has to give but part of you always looks back and thinks how did they manage to do that and i cant even manage to get up and get dressed liz none of these women have ever ever been able to do that without lots of livein childcare they havent really been supermums debbie i worked in an environment where most of the managers and the directors were male so they had a stayathome wife great so their children were sorted they can carry on the next promotions there but you come back as a woman after maternity leave and its very different but i wouldnt want to have children and then pay for them to be looked after from six in the morning until oclock at night whats the point in having children elspeth might as well have a goldfish elisca but is a supermum really a woman who goes to work at six in the morning and comes home at pm wheres the mum role in that a supermum is somebody who is able to juggle their career but still have time for the child and has worked out the balance with a partner or good childcare who still feels familyorientated that theyre able to juggle and have a sense of being a mother claire why does a supermum have to be somebody who works why cant a supermum be somebody whos happy at home who is full time im someone who did wonderful things in my twenties ive done my career i dont feel i need to work for myself and weve worked out financially a way of me not working why do i have to have a job in order to be classified liz well to me a vision of a supermum is one who makes their own playdoh and does interesting activities aruna if you are doing one job if you werent full time they dont call you fulltime workers you arent working one job or other you are doing two jobs together thats why they are calling it supermum we asked whether expectations of mothers have changed over time is it possible to have a winwin situation where nothing suffers neither your family nor your sanity or is there always a price to be paid aruna pressures are different because expectations are different for some people the younger ones are expected to be at home and to stop at home and if you are on a low income and you are both going out to work a lot of people find that if they are both going out to work they dont get any family credit so theyre paying for everything at the end of the day theyre getting less than the people who are staying at home elisca coming from an indian family it was expected that my mother would stay and home and raise the children there was never any debate or discussion about my mother working claire my mother stayed at home and culturally from a lancashire husbands point of view she was expected to be at home full time anyway with both labour and the tories desperately trying to woo women voters we asked our panel what their ambitions were for their own daughters and for the future elspeth ive got a yearold weve already talked about this and the career that shes aiming for and we had to opt for a career that she can use before she gets married and until she has children and then a career she can use later as well shes decided she wants to be a music teacher or a dance teacher and she said after ive got children ill be able to do that part time shes quite adamant about that clairei would say be the same as me and have a good time in your twenties and have lots of interesting jobs travelling round the world and hope that you meet someone in your thirties so you can start a family but you might not get married you might not have children so you cant plan i think you have to go full tilt into it as a career woman if you do then you can just give it up because hopefully then youll have married someone whos got the same amount of money because youve met them in these circles and you can afford to stay at home elspeth i have a friend whos her children are teenagers and the manager of a small company employed her and said it was because im very relieved that youre not going to go off on maternity leave im very relieved that i can rely on you he probably shouldnt have said that but its a small company and thats how things are debbie i found it very hard because i wanted to go back four days at week and work a day at home as well and that was poohpoohed straightaway and my boss came round when my daughter was three months old and said you do realise this is a sixdayaweek job and i kind of stood shaking at the door holding my daughter thinking why am i trying to do it now i dont want to give six days a week to this job but i was and i needed that i dont know if it was recognition i needed to prove that i could liz my daughters only and she can see how much enjoyment i get from going back to work and she will want to do that same thing i do ive been able to work part time ever since they were born but being stuck at home can be very stressful so what would their own perfect solution be if money were no object is there an ideal solution or will there always have to be sacrifice and compromise liz part time work for everybody ann they should support the mother up until the child is nine to months but give them extra income so shes not suffering financially and going back to work then youd obviously have the money for daycare and whatever elisca tax breaks for families whether its the mother or the father where one goes to work and one stays at home i think that should be assessed its like having another career isnt it having children debbie when i have bad days i feel oh god id love just to put on a suit or go out for the day and feel that ive got something to say that doesnt involve children at the end of the day i feel lucky to have that choice and to have my children and there are a lot of people who dont have that but i think there should be more in place that means that if women want to stay at home they are are paid for it claire im perfectly happy where i am if money was no object id be at home full time and go on more foreign holidays but ive had the power and the situation to make my own choices and a lot of people havent elisca im not unhappy i just feel that as a working mother there are certain sacrifices that i have to make to have a balance im also fortunate that i work for a woman whos got four children who runs the company underneath im quite grateful that she knows what its like to be a mother i still put in the hours but i know in the back of my mind that she knows elspeth the definition of a mum is that you have to make sacrifices claire but the rewards are so much greater than the sacrifices i miss travelling i miss staying in fivestar hotels and running groups of businessmen round the world but i wouldnt miss putting my daughter to bed every night i wouldnt miss that for the world travel after a while its boring but the rewards of the daytoday scene my daughter playing or laughing are infinite the frustrations are infinite as well but the rewards are much more

so the shine has come off supermum according to a cambridge university report published this week more people now think that a woman who works does so at the expense of her family enthusiasm for equality in the workplace peaked in the s and is now waning leaving aside the fact that all this is based on a sixyearold survey and also that record numbers of women are now returning to work who is or was supermum anyway i am a woman who works as arts editor for the guardian and who also has a small child ninety per cent of the time these two things hang together and i am in no way super never have been never will be i meant to wear high heels yesterday but never changed out of my cycling shoes my oneyearold daughter went to nursery in her pyjamas and i couldnt get her to stand still long enough to brush her hair but these are details big picture it rubs along of all the many myths about motherhood the one that says you cant hang on to a demanding job is the worst i remember worrying in the early months of pregnancy that some time around the sixmonth mark my mind would go to mush and all judgment desert me because everyone said it would and it didnt happen you can be a mother and not lose your mind you can also be a mother and work and still not lose your mind i recently heard a senior executive in the city shrug off the fact that there were only two female company chairs in the ftse she said that some women not her were sensible and stayed at home to look after their kids others like her were a bit crazier and pursued eatyoualive jobs and didnt have children it was a sad opposition and one that was very revealing about the citys allornothing male work ethic nearly all the women i know who didnt go back to work after having children worked in the city as lawyers traders bankers you could say they made their own choices i would argue that their arms were powerfully forced what does nobody tell you about being a working mother that it can be a lot of fun life feels incredibly full and often in a good way so dont count yourself out because everyone tells you it cant be done and something will have to give and that something will be you and most importantly dont count yourself out because without you in the workplace the situation wont keep improving which it is as a colleague told me after i returned from maternity leave yes there will be days when you have to make big decisions after being up all night but you have had hangovers before and lived and on those days when it does work being a working mother is the best thing in the world its what the suffragettes chained themselves to the railings for lets not quit while were ahead,2008-08,shine ha come supermum according cambridge university report published week people think woman work doe expense family enthusiasm equality workplace peaked waning leaving aside fact based sixyearold survey also record number woman returning work wa supermum anyway woman work art editor guardian also ha small child ninety per cent time two thing hang together way super never never meant wear high heel yesterday never changed cycling shoe oneyearold daughter went nursery pyjama couldnt get stand still

is it a blip or is the tide going out after years when it seemed that nothing could reverse the glacially slow yet inexorable progress towards a world where it was taken for granted that women and men would have equality in their life and work academics at cambridge have found that support for the idea that mothers can go out to work without harming their families is falling and support for the view that men are the breadwinners and women the carers is rising what is going on lacking the resources not to mention the skills to organise the kind of global survey that underpins these findings one can only look around and take a wild guess and when you look around you see the following young women leaving school or university with grades as good as their male peers but choosing to take lowerpaid work because they dont see pay as a kind of virility symbol and anyway they arent too worried about virility symbols you see little change in who does what at home and financial pressure now allied with financial insecurity is leading to desperate anxiety about paying the bills and keeping the job which equals everlonger hours at the coalface this is not an environment for people with major responsibilities outside the workplace and thats still women women with children and women with elderly parents this is an unfinished revolution great leaps towards equality have been taken in my working lifetime but only in the abstract now young men and women set off at least superficially from the same starting line but years on in their lives progress towards fathers and mothers equality the fair division of work and caring is almost nonexistent maybe thats unkind its great that theres now paternity leave and serious progress on ideas about sharing parental leave between parents less great that it relies on employers to make it a financially sensible option all the same the legislation of the past years has cleared a narrow path towards the sunlit uplands of genuine equality but there are plenty of elephant traps along the way as nicola brewer chief executive of the new equalities and human rights commission warned in an interview recently there is a real risk that the legislation intended to protect and promote gender equality will end up with too many employers finding reasons for not taking on women of child bearing age while extending maternity leave merely reinforces notions of gender segregation for all the nominal gains women are actually little nearer genuine equality than they were in the s we have fought and we have not won partly thats because a lot of us still expect too little of ourselves but maybe something else something more positive is going on here too it was a cliche of s sociology that when the costs of motherhood became apparent then fewer women would want to become mothers a generation on women and men are beginning to reverse the argument to point out the rewards and responsibilities of parenthood and the need for carers in society we may still be years behind northern europe but slowly it is dawning on us all that bringing up the kids is an amazingly important and rewarding thing to do precious beyond the pay packet the more complex and important a task childrearing is understood to be the more one parent is going to want to forsake their fullon career in order to stay home at least some of the time since the idea of real equality in the workplace probably has at least another generation to go before it is a reality and other work pdf by professor jacqueline scott who edited the book published today has underlined the resilience of traditional attitudes to families its the mothers who are assumed not least by themselves to be responsible for the caring bit one day that will change but for the time being it may be the reason why attitudes appear to have gone into reverse people have understood the question in a different way its not the career that really matters stoopid its the

men who appear charming one minute and terrifyingly aggressive the next or who put pressure on their partner to have sex are showing early warning signs of domestic abuse according to a campaign launched by refuge yesterday the charity britains biggest single provider of support and accommodation for female victims of domestic violence said that although most women recognised physical abuse other subtler forms of control such as telling women what they could wear were not recognised as abusive behaviour and could escalate into violence refuge also called on the government to do more preventive work by targeting young people in schools sandra horley chief executive of refuge said it is essential that women receive the right education and information so they understand the techniques of control frequently used by abusive men it is all too easy for women to excuse their partners possessive and jealous behaviour but in doing so they run the risk of the abuse increasing in frequency and severity once she recognises theres a problem she can do something about it the government spends very little on education campaigns on what is a major social problem according to the home office two women in england and wales are killed by their partner or expartner every week and the most recent british crime survey reported about m incidents of domestic abuse against women but refuge said the campaign was not only aimed at those in abusive relationships but also at women who may need to make informed decisions about future partners the charity said a slap or a shove could escalate into a brutal beating and murder and recognising early signs would save lives warning signs which refuge said women should look for included whether a partner was stopping you from seeing family and friends being constantly critical and putting you down in public being excessively jealous and possessive telling you what to wear who to see where to go and what to think controlling your money and whether you have started walking on eggshells to avoid making your partner angry a survey by yougov commissioned by the charity found that half of respondents had experienced at least one of

information on early warning signs what perpetrators do is make women feel like its their fault and its often a wearing down over a period of time women arent always aware that theres a pattern or

parenting classes to be rolled out across the country in the next three years work well but struggle to recruit fathers the biggest uk study into them has discovered mothers and fathers who had taken the courses told researchers they were calmer and more confident with their children and spent more time listening and talking to them some parents opted to try the classes in parts of england including manchester cornwall and croydon between september and this march all had children aged between eight and with behavioural or psychological difficulties most of the parents had left school at but some were graduates parents watched dvds of good parenting and were encouraged to use at home the skills they had been taught they also attended discussion groups with between and other parents the local authorityrun courses were devised by psychologists in the us and australia and led by educational or clinical psychologists teachers and parents the government funded the courses which last between six and weeks at a cost of m it intends to run the same or similar classes across the country over the next three years the cost of a course is for each parent professor geoff lindsay director of the centre for educational development appraisal and research at warwick university was the lead author of the governmentcommissioned study into the classes he said this study provides substantial evidence that these programmes can be rolled out effectively across a large number of local authorities there is now considerable evidence to suggest that such programmes do have benefits in improving antisocial behaviour in children and the psychological and social functioning of parents however he said the government could struggle to recruit fathers to the classes only one in eight parents taking the courses was male lindsay said all local authorities were aware of this as a problem and related it to the timing of the courses parent being seen to mean mother and a lack of men running the classes fathers perhaps feel a bit inhibited by parenting courses particular efforts need to be made to address this one parent told the researchers he would find the manual really useful but

all forms of domestic violence psychological economic emotional and physical come from the abusers desire for power and control over other family members or intimate partners domestic violence is the result of an abusers desire for power and control domestic violence is a pattern of controlling and aggressive behaviours from one adult usually a man towards another usually a woman within the context of an intimate relationship those three bald statements are taken from the top three british links offered by google uk when you type in the words domestic violence namely womens aid refuge and the bbc respectively they reflect the yearold orthodoxy that places domestic violence largely or entirely in the context of patriarchal power and control domestic violence is a genderbased phenomenon that serves the purpose of subjugating women and entrenching male privilege this is an article of faith for many feminists it is also to a large extent false if this theory were merely an ideological rallying cry for political activists or an academic standpoint for polemicists it might be relatively harmless when it is influencing the delivery of essential potentially lifesaving publiclyfunded services not to mention legal systems and lawenforcement practices it cannot be allowed to stand unchallenged there are few debates more tedious or ignoble than the domestic violence numbers game ever since womens refuge pioneer erin pizzey first demurred from the consensus by suggesting that women could sometimes be not only the victims but also the perpetrators of domestic violence feminists and their opponents have been engaged in a sporadic game of male v female top trumps with one side trying to outscore the other on frequency severity and justifiability of offences its a pointless unwinnable and demeaning exercise for those involved and utterly degrading to those actually caught in abusive relationships what i would hope could be agreed by all is that domestic violence is horrific whoever the victim might be and that as a society we must find approaches that minimise the incidence of offences and maximise the support and security that can be offered to victims by even arguing about symmetry we buy into a thoughtless sexist dichotomy that attributes qualities to people solely by virtue of their sex every victim deserves our compassion and our help victims and offenders alike should be respected as unique complex individuals not representatives of one random half of humanity what can and must be addressed however is the theory that domestic violence is a monolithic phenomenon with a single explanation and a straightforward pattern of innocent female victims and evil male offenders over the past years a huge body of academic work most notably by michael p johnson and colleagues has sought to define and refine a typology of domestic violence different theorists have different categories and different labels of course in the most frequently quoted models pdf there are four distinct types of incidents johnson calls them coercive controlling violence violent resistance situational couple violence and separationinstigated violence whatever interventions harmreduction policies or judicial approaches one may advocate it should be unarguable that these different types of abusive situations have very different causes and will therefore require very different responses since research has consistently shown that as few as a quarter of domestic violence cases are straightforward examples of a man violently asserting patriarchal power over a female partner and yet to this day pretty much all mainstream services hold this as their default assumption the almost total absence of refuges and support services for abused men has been well documented but it is also worth noting that if a man seeks help to address his violent behaviour and control his abusive impulses almost every town and city has a range of selfhelp groups and treatment programmes available to him after a fairly exhaustive search and inquiries to leading organisations such as relate and respect ive been unable to identify a single organisation in the uk offering an equivalent service to violent and abusive women not one linda g mills is a lawyer turned professor of social work at new york university a selfdeclared feminist and also a survivor of abusive relationships in her essential new book violent partners she takes issue with the orthodoxy of domestic violence services using many heartbreaking casestudies mills details a litany of deficient services ineffective responses and miscarriages of justice all with roots in the ideological model of patriarchal power much more significantly however she shines a light on several alternative approaches founded not on dogma but on a huge body of crossdisciplinary research and practice mills sees violent behaviour as being part of a cycle of abuse learned responses that spiral within relationships but also across generations for men and women alike in a radical break from feminist doctrine she suggests that the most effective ways to address those destructive habits involve blamefree counselling including selfhelp groups couples therapy and healing circles alongside judicial processes based on restorative justice around of women and of men who suffer in violent relationships do not report the incidents or seek help and support most commonly because they do not want to risk breaking up their family or seeing their partner jailed similarly many victims refuse to cooperate with investigations and prosecutions mills argues convincingly that a less threatening less divisive less judgmental approach to this kind of violence could lead to far greater use of support services at a much earlier stage with far greater effectiveness thereby avoiding immense human suffering and saving lives we shouldnt underestimate the contribution made by feminists to the struggle against domestic violence without the arguments and the activism of the womens movement police might still dismiss serious physical and sexual assaults as just a domestic without their energy and dedication there would be no refuges no hostels no support services for anyone we can gratefully acknowledge all this but that does not mean that our understanding the issues has to remain frozen sometime around i have no doubt that feminist activists with their vast experience and passion for a better world still have a huge amount to give to domestic violence campaigns and voluntary projects

it is often referred to as one of the worlds forgotten conflicts but every time i hear about the turbulent situation in the eastern region of the democratic republic of the congo drc it never ceases to amaze me how the world can so easily turn a blind eye to a war that has caused untold suffering the war in eastern drc has destabilised the region for a decade in that time more than million people have died either as a result of the violence or from preventable diseases despite a peace agreement that was signed in january between some warring factions the conflict rages on and hundreds of thousands of people have been caught up in the violence according to a new report published by amnesty international thousands of women and girls are suffering horrendous sexual violence and children are being forced to fight the report reveals that as many as half of the children who had previously been reunited with their families have since been forced to rejoin armed groups one yearold boy called samuel was forced to rejoin the maimai forces in august last year after previously serving with the same group for nearly a year in samuel told amnesty that his unit regularly raped women killed and looted often under the influence of alcohol and drugs he said that some commanders would withhold food from boys unless they raped a woman or girl amnesty has discovered that samuels tale is not unusual we have heard similar distressing reports from other former child soldiers interviewed the situation for these young boys is very bleak but tragically they arent the only victims in this conflict amnestys new report shows that thousands of women and girls some as young as six have been raped or have endured other forms of sexual violence since the peace agreements failure rape is often carried out in public in front of children husbands fathers or mothers its regularly used as a weapon of war designed to humiliate weaken and destabilise not only the woman and her immediate family but also the wider community mass rape of civilians has long been recognised as a war crime but it is still being regularly used in many conflicts earlier this year the un security council adopted resolution which called for an immediate end to sexual violence against the general population in all conflicts amnesty international is urging all parties in the congolese conflict to no longer deploy rape as an instrument of war and for the government to protect all members of the general population in this warblighted region today as mentioned in amnestys blog the congolese government attempted to reject amnestys findings rejected amnestys findings claiming that children were not being taken to be child soldiers it also said that it would be investigating ongoing crimes

the majority of mothers feel no guilt about leaving their children to go out to work and believe their working life has improved since having children according to a new survey more than per cent of fulltime working mothers say they are a good role model for their children and more than half say they are happy to combine parenthood with a career according to research by mumsnetcom the uks biggest online parenting network the survey of more than working mothers also found women believe they work more efficiently after having children they add that they do not feel discriminated against with the majority believing their employment and promotion opportunities were just as bright as before they had children this whole debate about whether or how mothers juggle work and childcare is outdated and misogynistic said martha young a fulltime working mother of three children aged three to seven being repeatedly dragged back into this endless debate about whether we are damaging our family by working too hard or not hard enough has become boring and irrelevant theres nothing heroic or unusual about being a working mother i dont feel guilty about it and i dont feel like a supermum she said according to the survey more than per cent of working mothers work to provide income without which they say their family could not survive more than threequarters of respondents felt they worked more efficiently at work than before they had children almost per cent felt their colleagues did not resent them for taking time off for childrens events or emergencies however more than per cent of working mothers said they had no time for themselves and almost per cent said they spent little time alone with their partner most women think that working is good for them and their families the overwhelming sensation for most working mothers is more likely to be exhaustion than guilt said justine roberts cofounder of mumsnet its more a question of them being stretched to their absolute limit because theyre still being left to do most of the heavy lifting on the home front the culture that needs to change now is that being played out in most domestic spheres she said employers might be more aware of treating working mothers fairly but back at home its still the women who are coming home after doing a fulltime job and taking responsibility for the substantive side of bringing up their child by arranging playdates organising birthday parties and supervising homework the mumsnet survey contradicts a cambridge university report last month that suggested the shine of the supermum had worn off the study of three decades of social attitude surveys found that support for gender equality has declined with both women and men becoming more likely to believe the family will suffer if a woman works fulltime but mary macleod chief executive of the family and parenting institute said the mumsnet report confirmed two studies on motherhood and identity that it had carried out whats been a shame is the stoking of the mummy wars over recent years by pitting working mothers against those who choose to stay at home she said whatever choice a woman makes she feels she has to defend it when presented with research suggesting she might have done the wrong thing dr katherine rake director of the fawcett society which is dedicated to sexual equality agreed the mumsnet survey showed working mothers felt increasingly empowered in the professional sphere but said there still needed to be wholesale transformation of the workplace we need to make all roles flexible at every level she said,2008-09,majority mother feel guilt leaving child go work believe working life ha improved since child according new survey per cent fulltime working mother say good role model child half say

any woman in her early twenties pushing a pram in my part of south london must i immediately think be the nanny usually i am right when pregnant with my first child at the age of my midwife told me that most of the firsttime mothers she saw were in their midthirties the oldest in my antenatal group was and only one member was in her twenties a yearold neighbour became a new mother in the same month as me i had my second daughter six weeks ago at the age of and i feel like a youngster the fact that i had healthy pregnancies straightforward deliveries and like many people these days think i am at least years younger than i really am all add to this feeling but the dreaded elderly prima gravida was still written on my hospital notes at least this was slightly less insulting than the geriatric mother term used in the eighties to refer to women over who were pregnant i was not surprised by last weeks figures from the governments office for national statistics which showed that women in the south were most likely to start their families in their thirties on average years later than those in the north this was in part attributed to women wanting to establish careers before having babies and pointed to differences in education and earnings as other possible reasons for the gap as a teenager my friends and i assumed we would be married with children by the ancient age of having scaled the heights of our chosen professions however on leaving university it soon became clear to me that a career in journalism required long hours periods away from home and would take many years to achieve success and i gave it my all what was the point in studying for so many years only to forgo an exciting interesting job in favour of changing endless nappies and winding screaming babies by the time i was my friend carmen reid was the only person i knew in her twenties who had a child and boy was i glad not to be her it looked such hard work i was not ready to swap my sports car designer clothes and dancing until dawn for a pram sensible shoes and nighttime feeds i preferred to concentrate on my career and enjoying its trappings it was not until i was approaching my midthirties that i felt per cent ready for a family yes i am dog tired and yes after each birth my middleaged body felt like it had been subjected to rounds with ricky hatton but there are many advantages to being an older mother i have done my fair share of clubbing eating out travelling and general carousing i feel no frustration at the home ties presented by two young children when the baby is yelling for yet more milk while i battle to get my monthold to sit at the table and eat her tea i know that for me the grass is no greener elsewhere i have no desire to be partying on a thai beach or sipping manhattans in a hip cocktails lounge been there done that we are also financially better off we used to rent pokey flats with no space for energetic toddlers let alone a garden now we own a house which has a backyard with room for a swing and a separate kitchen and living room then there is my career ive spent many years building up experience on various national newspapers and feel that once my maternity leave is over i will be able to continue working in the industry at a certain level my reputation established had i taken time out to have children in my twenties and then had to leave the office to pick them up from nursery by pm i know it would have been near impossible to have forged the same career by the time im i may not have heard of the latest boy band beloved by my yearold daughter and my yearold will probably not want to borrow my clothes but i hope that having seen more of the world i may be able to provide better moral and educational guidance this may sound pompous but there are many historical examples edward vs mother elizabeth woodville gave birth to him when she was and that was in the th century when you were doing well to even reach your thirties the young prince was said to be exceptionally handsome goodnatured and intelligent surely his old ma must take some of the credit for this pitt the younger one of our greatest wartime prime ministers was also born to a mother in her thirties by the age of five he was writing plays in latin and was chancellor of the exchequer in his early twenties of course i was lucky to meet mr right and have children other women i know have hit their midthirties only to find they cannot conceive there is a prevailing view that feminism has let us down we were promised it all career husband children a smeg fridge and jimmy choo heels now we are criticised as career obsessives who gamble with their fertility there are countless reports about the perils of having babies in later life from the increased chances of abnormalities to the cost to the nhs because older women are more likely to have caesareans perhaps there will be a shift among my southernraised daughters generation and they will have children in their twenties like their northern counterparts,2008-09,woman early twenty pushing pram part south london must immediately think nanny usually right pregnant first child age

last years womens no pay day was held on october this is the point at which in accordance with the average pay gap between the genders women cease to earn for the year compared with their male colleagues and this years womens no pay day as the fawcett societys katherine rake noted ruefully at a women in journalism fringe this morning will also be held on october another year on and wage discrimination remains resolutely intractable as rake also argues the forthcoming equality bill provides a onceinageneration opportunity to remedy this already aspects of the new legislation are cause for approval if not outright celebration public authorities will have to declare their pay gap and in the private sector secrecy clauses that prevent colleagues discussing their salaries will be banned but the measure which many activists believe could be the most significant in targeting pay inequality is absent from the draft bill pay audits legally requiring organisations to undertake regular comparison of their employees pay and to take action to redress discrepancies in a discussion led by the redoubtable equality campaigner vera baird mp qc it was concluded that legislative change alone was not enough pay inequality is also about expectation or rather lack of it where flexible hours are still considered a concession to rather than an essential accommodation of family life women are likely to feel grateful rather than militant about their diminished remuneration likewise we know that a significant pay gap emerges among gradates within years of leaving university and that women of all ages are less likely to ask for a pay rise than men perhaps its time we trained our young women in the negotiation skills required to assert themselves in the workplace though im not holding out much hope since were still struggling to provide school children with the very basics of sex education baird mentioned at the beginning of the event that a commitment to wage equality

if one was ever in any doubt that men have rigid ideas about what types of employment theyre prepared to sully their lilywhite hands for one only has to think back to arnold schwarzenegger in kindergarten cop a movie entirely dedicated to the premise that the job of nursery teacher was intrinsically demeaning for a redblooded male even if the actor playing him did resemble stretch armstrong nervously arriving at his first gay disco almost years on and its not that guys are just as picky theyre getting worse according to the general teaching council there are no young under males currently working in staterun nurseries elsewhere in the state sector female teachers still outnumber men three to one and it remains rare for a man to teach in primary school one of the reasons given for this centres on men saying they find it hard to counter the gender stereotypes inherent in working with young children that it has become such a female stronghold males are put off by the thought of being perceived as unmanly out of place even suspicious reading this one might surmise that there is a barrier unfairly stopping men from making genuine headway in such careers that in this professional area its men who have become the oppressed minority quivering in the corners on parents evening holding placards reading im not a paedophile really or could it be that the real reason there are so few men in nursery and primary teaching arenas where strong male role models are sorely needed is that the money isnt great while the work is demanding but lowstatus all hallmarks of that widespread though still barely acknowledged phenomenon chickwork what is chickwork it is many things but basically it is any field of employment in which men dont fancy participating and therefore allow women to dominate in this way classic chickwork would be anything lowpaid gruelling most probably relating to cleaning small children or the caring professions hence the comparative rarity of mannies male nurses or guycleaners my brother a male rarity has managed state care facilities for the elderly and the homeless and by his account women willing to work in this twilight sphere generally outnumber men by at least five to one isnt this the real reason men shy away from teaching small children that it falls into the category of jobs they dont feel become them nothing to do with some bizarre borderline scifi concern about how their penisdecked persons are not welcome on planet of the female nursery teachers after all since when did that ever bother them one of the most screamingly funny sights of recent years has been the way men have muscled in on cooking sorry chefing since it started to look profitable and fun amazing how with a few rings of gordon and jamies cash tills scrambling an egg went from something sissy and domestic your mum and delia did to an act of highgrade machismo what happened to worrying about looking unmanly then see also the astonishing number of males prepared to wriggle their booty on the x factor or even enter model shows just a few examples of how when men want to pursue a profession even change its gender as it were theyre generally not shy about doing it and good luck to them so long as they dont try to pass off their lack of interest in areas such as nursery education with cries of sexistwolf in truth men in femaledominated fields have little in common with women in maledominated fields only last week the chartered management institute reported that at the current rate women in management positions should achieve equal pay by wow only years to wait should we feel spoiled by contrast education continues to fall over itself to attract men just a wild guess but im thinking it was never going to take years to get men paid equally in the femaledominated profession of teaching indeed maybe kindergarten cop said it all after all it wasnt the children raising objections to the new guy or the mainly female staff or the parents it was arnies character himself who seemed to fear that his very maleness came under threat the more he got his hands dirty with chickwork the only difference being that at the end of kindergarten cop arnie tearfully realised hed learned something in real life whats the betting hed have been tearing open his wage packet and sneering is this all you dopey bitches get paid honestly these golf wags really are the thin end of the wedge how adorable were the golf wags gags of europes ryder cup players when they lined up for their group photograph in louisville kentucky with their outfits coordinated by designer paul costelloe any ferrero rocherstyle ambassadors reception would have been proud to have them still the question has to be asked where is it going to end now that the wagvirus appears to be spreading across all sports should we start looking forward to the snooker version snags or even darts drags on second thoughts perhaps this wouldnt be a good idea my dad once threw a mean arrow but im not sure how my mum would have felt being paraded in front of cameras as she was trying to quietly sink a few rum and blacks its like i always say he chose to seek fame as rutland darts champion summer league why should she suffer still im glad to see everything returning to normal after the olympics silliness what with all that determination and endeavour and mere women winning medals and everything this photograph of the golf wags shows that the ladies are now back where they belong in sport reductively defined by their men dressed up to the nines and only competitive about their hair and makeup it would seem that in golf as in life fairways are one thing fair quite another forget this neardeath guff give me a ghost any day one hears that there is

the death thing and blew it all we got was woody allen bleating like a yearold were all going to die and making increasingly unwatchable films so forget allen serious medical studies into neardeath

have you ever queued for a toilet tried changing a babys nappy on a park bench slid off the alleged seat at the bus stop or failed to perch on it in the first place if so you are a victim of antiwomen urban design research presented last month at the royal geography societys annual conference found that our cities are still being designed for the benefit of men the report by dr gemma burgess of cambridge university concluded that the vast majority of town planners are ignoring the gender equality planning regulations that were brought in last year this is significant because if public spaces were designed with women in mind they would look entirely different with much more lighting bettersituated car parks and more areas where residential and office spaces are mixed making it far easier to juggle work and childcare the report noted progress in some specific areas in lewisham in southeast london for example says burgess they asked themselves where have we decided to build new office blocks they realised that where they were located was no good for anyone wanting to combine work and home so now they are thinking where can we get mixed development to make it easier for those people another local authority in south yorkshire organised a series of walkabout tours with architects and local women whose views were written into planning briefs there is something of a buzz around this subject in july the womens design service wds launched gendersite the worlds largest database on gender and the built environment and on october an allday gendersite event at queen mary university will feature an exhibition of work by women architects the speaker will be ruth reed who was elected the first woman president of the royal institute of british architects in july the current president of the royal town planning institute is also a woman janet oneill the wds publishes such mindboggingly fascinating titles as at womens convenience a handbook on the design of public womens toilets and celebrated its th anniversary last year having been founded by a group of women architects designers and planners in most of the things in our built environment are designed on a male model says wendy davis director of the wds before noting there are differences between men and women in terms of ergonomics women are generally smaller they have less reach they are less strong but designs that are hostile or useless to women still make it through as an example davis cites the recent removal of seats from train stations because of fears of vandalism they have been replaced with sloping shelves at the height of a ft in mans bottom by and large things are designed to accommodate mens bodies they dont take account of all the issues around the fact that were the ones who menstruate get pregnant need to breastfeed which brings us neatly to the subject of toilets almost all public spaces still accord the same number of square metres to male and female toilets and because women cant use urinals they end up with half as many toilets in the allocated space so why not double the allocation if you want to know the true position of women in society look at the queue for the ladies loo says clara greed professor of inclusive urban planning at the university of the west of england the urban planning concepts that affect women most are predictable creches housing design parks pavements safety and transport burgess points out that of bus journeys are taken by women and only of women have access to a car during the day but urban schemes are designed around car drivers and commuters many of the problems of urban planning simply reflect womens domestic inequality the fact that women still do the bulk of childcare looking after the elderly shopping and cleaning women are less likely to have a simple journey to work like men says greed they break up their journey stop off at the childminder school and then work and maybe the shops and school on the way back public transport favours the male commute in and out of the city centre it is disturbing when you start to think about it that women simply accept the physical and geographical limitations placed on them in everyday life you are used to it being uncomfortable says eeva berglund a social anthropologist and author of doing things differently a history of the womens design service one of the major issues is the way that women restrict their lives you choose where you go and where you dont go and you come to find that acceptable this chills me slightly as i remember the times i have excluded myself from shops offices public transport options arts events and restaurants because i have a buggy with me because i am carrying a baby who will need breastfeeding or have various children in tow who wont make it up all the steps when i first had a baby i noticed this and found it annoying now like a stepford wife automaton i accept it and i never sit on those sloping shelves at bus stops or stations because they are at a weird height but how can we change all these things above all it is about architects whether male or female being open to these issues more women in the industry would help too because at least some of them would design in their own image designers see themselves at the end of their pencil or their mouse says davis until about years ago most architects and planners were men they saw themselves moving through this environment because they were men and they were car drivers they were interested in keeping commuters moving its the same issue as with disability they didnt understand how a mm lip on a kerb could upset a buggy or a wheelchair not that they were being sexist it just didnt occur to them burgess argues that despite the failings revealed in her report there has been some significant progress there are massive new developments planned for the next decade and there is a lot of potential for getting things right she says others are more sceptical most of the planners and urban decisionmakers are still men says greed do they care is anything happening not a lot gender has a low priority but what is good for women is good for

the government could learn a thing or two about tackling violence against women from the us vicepresidential candidate no i dont mean the guntoting antiabortionist sarah palin im referring to joe biden senator for delaware and barack obamas running mate for the democrats for biden is the man who wrote the groundbreaking violence against women act vawa pdf in that was renewed and strengthened in and the vawa has led to programmes laws and initiatives including a national domestic violence hotline improved criminal justice responses better legal access for poor and immigrant women prevention programmes and critically funding for support services such as domestic violence shelters and rape crisis centres administered by the department of justice more than bn has been awarded to governments and communitybased responses under the vawa its no wonder that biden says he considers the act the single most significant legislation that ive crafted during my year tenure in the senate in america the vawa represents a concerted national effort to tackle genderbased violence closer to home the scottish government has also been addressing violence against women more strategically and a national violenceagainstwomen fund has led to the expansion of rape crisis centres in contrast there is a fractured criminal justicedriven approach in the rest of the uk that has resulted in a funding crisis for womens support services the rape crisis sector south of the border is being decimated as one group after another closes because of funding cuts there are now just affiliated rape crisis centres left in england and wales half the number there were in the s and no funded centres in northern ireland at all meaning that most rape victims do not have access to the specialist support they deserve a oneoff injection from the government of m to shore up centres facing immediate closure is welcome but not a longterm solution in fact oneinthree local authorities across the uk do not have domestic violence shelters or other specialist services at all as was graphically demonstrated by end violence against women and the equality and human rights commission last year in our map of gaps report nevertheless ministers are digging their heels in by maintaining that funding for lifesaving services is not possible at a national level rather it is the responsibility of local authorities unfortunately as a result of local commissioning processes local authorities are increasingly turning to larger generic services such as housing providers or faith organisations which are cheaper than womens organisations but do not have the expertise on genderbased violence thats been developed over decades in the womens sector in addition services for ethnic minority women which deal with issues like forced marriage are being squeezed by community cohesion guidance from the government on the funding of single strand groups ealing council in west london has recently been forced to rethink its decision to stop funding southall black sisters after high court action other councils are also facing legal action as trevor phillips chair of the equality and human rights commission has warned that the commission will use the gender equality duty against local authorities if they fail to ensure that women have access to specialist services so you could say its all a bit of a mess meanwhile in america there is the prospect of a vicepresident who believes that national funding of violence against women services is one of the biggest achievements of his political career ministers here could take a leaf out of senator bidens book,2008-09,government could learn thing two tackling violence woman u vicepresidential candidate dont mean guntoting antiabortionist sarah palin im

this isnt going to be easy not least since ive just swallowed a shard from a duck bone interviewing people in restaurants is always a mistake theyre just about to admit to killing their father or doing something unspeakable to their mother when the meringue arrives and the chuen cheng ku chinese restaurant on the edge of londons soho may be a bigger mistake than most as the waitress speaks hardly any english and i have only the haziest idea what i am eating but the food writer elisabeth luard was keen to get some lunch so here we are talking about her new memoir my life as a wife which scampers through years of marriage to the racy nicholas luard proprietor and saviour of private eye in its infancy cofounder with peter cook of the pioneering early s establishment comedy club travel writer novelist cofounder of the london marathon conservationist antiapartheid campaigner alcoholic philanderer and allround impossible husband luard died of cancer in the book is a portrait of a marriage and its opening nicely captures the ambiguity of the relationship this is the story of my life as a wife or how to stay married for years without actually murdering your husband a love story the verdict luard tells me when ive extracted the duck bone from my throat could have gone either way it started as the story of a marriage she says and i didnt think it was going to end up like that as a love letter it was basically how to stay married for years without actually murdering the bastard that was the core of what i embarked on but writing it was like the truth and reconciliation commission it really did change i could suddenly understand why people need to speak about things because if you speak about them they lose their sharpness luard was alcohol dependent all his life extramarital affair dependent too if the stories in the book are to be believed such as the time when they were living in spain that he managed to give a sexually transmitted disease to both his wife and the au pair wasnt she mad to stay with him except for a yearlong separation in the early s when her patience finally ran out through thick and thin we never quite get to the heart of this central question first she offers negative reasons for sticking around i wanted to say this is how a marriage happens its selfevidently not all plain sailing theres a lot of encouragement now to run for the hills but there are other considerations its a different decision when you have children and a different decision too even when your children are adult because if you have someone in the kind of physical condition nicholas was in your children if theyre well brought up would pick up the pieces when you walk away when i protest that this sounds more like force of circumstance than grand passion she changes tack you can sound a bit elitist if you say i loved living with this man who was so literate so interesting i liked the fact that he had a very fine very educated mind and after years of marriage we could sit across the table from each other and discuss whatever we wanted that was great and thats what i miss with nicholas his political ideas were so interesting you can see that with his career his conservation work that ability to see the way we should go and then get up and do it the truth may be that luard herself doesnt know what kept them together when a love affair is over she says in the book whatever the reason the heart and mind keep the print i can draw no conclusions from the life that we shared all i can say is that this is what happened at that particular moment this is how it was this is how it seemed to me some things are left unsaid we are free to choose what we remember and what we forget there are no definitive portraits of a marriage the books title seems selfdeprecating for someone who has built a successful career in her own right as an illustrator food writer and author why put herself down in that way i called it that because its the truth she says my life was completely dictated by the fact that i was a wife and its written for all those people who are wives i used to get asked when i was kneedeep in four children do you work her background was privileged wealthy mother airman father killed in the war diplomat stepfather with whom she didnt get on but peculiar she was a debutante in but quickly saw through the charade i was outraged by the whole business she says which wasnt bad for a yearold it was like a cattle market i remember thinking this is not that much different from what goes on in soho for heavens sake weve both got a price ours just happens to be higher she was smart but uneducated this was a time when posh women were meant to be good at entertaining and motherhood and not much else her mother who was living in mexico with her diplomat husband paid luards rent but she had to earn her keep which is how she came to be working in private eyes cramped office above the establishment club in greek street where she fell in love more or less at first sight with her husbandtobe they married in had four children in quick succession and decamped to spain when the satire bubble burst and luards business enterprises foundered he turned to writing instead starting with a highly regarded book on andalucia but money thereafter was tight and once her children were bigger elisabeth had of necessity to embark on her own career i needed to earn a living she says and i was never not busy she wrote european peasant cookery the princess and the pheasant the barricaded larder and the flavours of andalucia and even tried her hand at a novel then in she produced family life a happy book about bringing up her peripatetic family conceived she says as a my family and other animalstype memoir with recipes and drawings that ends with a tragedy that played out as she was writing the book the death from aids of her eldest daughter francesca in francescas death is detailed in a moving coda told from the perspective of both mother and daughter knowing the inevitable writes luard she made certain that everyone who knew and loved her understood perfectly what had happened to her and then she set the matter aside and went about reorganising her life francesca gave up her job as a journalist on the daily mail where she covered lifestyle subjects and took up painting instead lifes too short for shopping she told her mother i think she knew who she got it hiv from luard tells me she very bravely rang up the list of exes and said oi youd better go and get yourself tested she knew about five and the sixth said he hadnt picked up the result but she had no rancour about it she was much more worried about who she had passed it on to she was really remarkable that coda in family life also hints at the accommodation she and her husband reached in the painfully bright days they spent nursing their daughter and afterwards when they returned to the remote farmhouse in wales that nicholas had inherited from his godmother we find she writes just a few years before luard was himself diagnosed with cancer that the division of our labours means that we have neither grown apart nor together but in parallel perhaps because of this we still find each other surprising and interesting unexpectedly after three decades of independent living we can still learn from each other we know one anothers weaknesses and strengths and after all these years take care not to tap too hard on the cracks after lunch luard has her photograph taken a neat touch this in the nightclub that now occupies the old establishment club premises in greek street with a nod to its heritage it is called zebrano at the establishment luard preening for the camera looks pleased to be back then she heads off ploughing her way through the traffic in piccadilly circus and shouting after me the one thing that what you called my privileged upbringing gave me was a belief that everything would be all right i dont fear anything as if i needed telling how else could she have survived the successive losses of devoted daughter and errant husband and still be in love with the world my life as a wife is

the woman heading the womens resource centre wrc is remarkably upbeat for someone who admits she is watching many of her hardestwon victories systematically dismantled before her eyes vivienne hayes who as chief executive at umbrella body wrc represents over small womens charities and community groups across the uk says she is working in a sector facing a fundamental crisis both in terms of funding and the seeming lack of political will to support the existence of singleissue womens services at local and national level while the uks womens groups make up of all charities they collectively receive just of central government funding after all that the womens sector fought for decades ago to see refuges and rape crisis centres closing to hear our members struggling to live hand to mouth while literally saving lives every week well in many ways it just feels like were regressing she says organised resistance the plight of rape crisis services is especially painful for hayes who started her career working in grassroots womens domestic violence services and local support networks hayes was one of those campaigning long and hard for a national network of dedicated local health and counselling services for rape survivors in the s by there were centres in england and wales now only are left with fears that half of those remaining could close in the near future unless local partnerships step in to fund specialist services at a time when the uk has one of the worst rape conviction rates in europe weve got local authorities saying that they dont think these services are deemed worthy to fund says hayes with a shake of her head it beggars belief hayes says the problems faced by the womens sector are indicative of a wider problem of funding for singleissue voluntary organisations the government doesnt want to talk about there still being a need for genderspecific services or singleissue services which is frankly laughable she says its easier for them to farm out big public service contracts to big providers and wash their hands of the impact this will have at local level last year as hayes saw more and more of the wrcs members being forced to close their doors she decided to get organised weve got members across the country many that are just a handful of women sitting in a room somewhere trying to help other vulnerable women in their community she says they dont have the time or the capacity to respond to what became clear was a sectorwide funding crisis and it was our job to step into the breach and pull the whole thing together the response was the first mass lobbying campaign the womens sector has ever run called why women the campaign which unites womens groups across the uk calls for more recognition from the government for the need for womens services more secure funding streams and increased support for its campaigning work force for change as part of the campaign the wrc commissioned the first comprehensive and qualitative research into the impact and work of womens groups helping some of the uks most disadvantaged and vulnerable communities armed with their findings they have launched an assault on local councillors westminster mps journalists and policy makers we got very focused says hayes she sweeps her arm around the wrcs crowded but cramped office in clerkenwell in central london we may look disorganised but when we got the bit between our teeth there was no stopping us they have already seen their efforts pay off earlier this year the why women campaign helped win m in emergency funding to try to halt the closure of rape crisis centres the wrcs campaign research also led to the un criticising the uk governments funding to womens groups last month a report by the uns convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women cedaw which outlined the findings of the committee on the elimination of discrimination against women united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland stated that changes in the allocation of government funding from a needsbased to a commissioning framework have negatively impacted on funding to womens organisations i do feel like were managing to change the perception of womens groups slowly but surely says hayes in december last year the umbrella group was appointed by capacitybuilders the m programme launched to build the capacity of the voluntary sector to run the national equalities and diversity infrastructure programme capacity building wrc running a national infrastructure programme it would have seemed impossible even months ago says hayes now suddenly im being asked to sit on all these panels and take part in all these meetings and they wouldnt have even let me through the door six months ago people were able to dismiss the womens sector as a bunch of crazy old feminists before but were showing were actually a relevant and much needed force for change just hours after the interview hayes was on hand to see southall black sisters sbs one of the uks most highprofile and bestknown womens groups win its high court case against ealing council in west london over the decision to withdraw funding for sbss domestic violence services for black and minority ethnic women she believes the experience of sbs should be a rallying cry to the rest of the sector not to sit down and take it when funding is cut or withdrawn from them its so easy for small voluntary groups to feel like they cant do anything to change the funding decisions being passed on high but i think what weve done is show that working together and being organised and focussed can bring real change weve still got a really long way to go we could still fail in our mission to stop this sector from dissolving but were not going to take

the struggle for funding facing charities working with vulnerable and disenfranchised women speaks volumes about the crisis facing hundreds of thousands of singleissue voluntary groups working with those falling through the gaps in social care provision across the uk as the gulf between funding to large national public service delivery charities and local singleissue organisations widens our two examples below show how well groups on the ground are weathering the storm when barnsley sexual abuse and rape crisis helpline bsarch launched in every thursday night the founding volunteers would take a telephone downstairs to a borrowed office and spend two hours taking calls from desperate women some years on it offers facetoface counselling and advice services and is now open four nights a week to anyone experiencing domestic violence in the borough we work with some women who may have experienced abuse or years ago says project officer katie russell its not just recent rapes barnsley is quite a traditional community more so than neighbouring places like leeds i think thats sometimes an issue people feel its not the done thing to talk about these experiences the group has three fulltimers and around volunteers it survives on a year of which comes from barnsley council supplemented by from the home office to help employ an outreach worker the rest comes from a threeyear grant from the big lottery which ends in october the primary care trust and local authority are supportive but have no money for us says russell were now plugging away with fundraising again and its difficult to find capacity for that while also providing your core service but weve managed for years another group the asian women resource centre was founded in by women who felt existing social services did not meet their needs or understand the cultural or linguistic barriers faced by many women in their community at first the centre in harlesden northwest london primarily gave advice around welfare benefits and how to access services it has now evolved into a service providing expert advice and support to women experiencing domestic violence we offer support and information within a culturally sensitive framework says sarbjit ganger director of the centre which provides its services for a year through a mishmash of funding support comes from other women who have been through similar situations we also provide advocacy on behalf of domestic violence survivors reporting crimes to the police and writing letters to solicitors and housing departments support and advice for asian women in these circumstances is particularly pressing because they often have no recourse to public funds they are marooned outside social service provision and without the charity many would have nobody to turn to if the marriage breaks down because of violence for instance the women are subject to deportation or may have to stay in the marriage the centre has been funded by london councils including brent and neighbourhood renewal three years of neighbourhood renewal funding has now ended and support from london councils has been cut its a challenging time for us says ganger the whole commissioning process has left a lot of casualties we get funding for one year for three years its a constant struggle but we provide good value for money and we are carrying on we have to support these women because domestic violence can be a life or death issue bsarchorg asianwomencentreorguk,2008-09,struggle funding facing charity working vulnerable disenfranchised woman speaks

if womens lives have changed it makes sense that the public spaces where women network and congregrate have changed too so why has the news that the bramley branch of the womens institute has a rival organisation in the hampshire village called bramley wi lite been enough to grab the attention of newspapers like the daily mail on the surface there is nothing surprising about bramley wi lite in the course of a few generations womens lives have changed beyond recognition and there is much greater diversity than ever before it is hardly surprising that new womens organisations and cultures are making themselves known in the space of a year the group has become the fastest growing wi branch in the country with its sexandthecity cocktail of lifedrawing classes with male nudes saucy calendars sessions in how to move seductively by a burlesque dance troupe and book discussions about lesbian crime a sex therapist is scheduled and the groups first outing was to see the theatre show puppetry of the penis this is classic genderquake territory and it suggests a titanic battle between the old guard and the new when bramley wi lite began last year there were such ructions in the village population that the existing wi sent objection letters to the national federation of womens institutes to no avail bramley wi lite was given the goahead and now has members from their early s upwards about three times as many as the older organisation sex and fun it seems sell and even womens institutes are finding that if they are to find new members they must change with the times more than a decade ago i did a report for demos on how traditional womens organisations were at risk of decline because they were failing to speak to a new generation of women i explored the role of traditional organisations like the womens institutes as well as the role of more campaigning more overtly feminist organisations i predicted that the historic decline in the former would continue as more and more women rejected traditional roles and went out to work and warned the more radical campaigning organisations that if they wished to recruit a new antipolitical generation to their cause they needed to speak to them in a language that made sense to them the historic decline in membership among traditional organisations like womens institutes was mirrored by a proliferation in the number of professional networks and associations for women in the workplace a phenomenon i dubbed business feminism as womens energy appetite for change and activism was being carried into the workplace rather than into traditional politics soon after the media and social commentators were awash with debates about the new feminism what some critics dubbed feminism lite the director of the fawcett society the main campaigning organisation for womens equality who had cowritten a pamphlet with me on how the parties should win womens votes and appeal to a younger generation of women decided it was time to step aside and a younger director took up the leadership mantle feminist values were continuing to flourish and were making their way into daily life and finding new organisational forms over a decade on we appear to have gone full circle with the emergence of wi lite as its president emma cunningham says we take the best bits of traditional wi and give them a makeover we did upset a few people but really the two groups have different demographics this mix of modernity with tradition is smart marketing almost years ago my pamphlet no turning back argued the revolution in attitudes and aspirations among women in sexuality relationships family life work and politics were too advanced to reverse we would never go back to basics in the same way again some women may now be choosing to stay at home or returning home but they are no longer content to remain submissive or cast in traditional roles in a sense it is the logic of these generational and demographic shifts in womens lives that womens institutes have finally caught up just as there is a certain kind of historic inevitability about the penetration of ladette culture into this last bastion of traditional femininity yet even torchbearers for traditional roles newspapers like the daily mail and even the wi itself understand that if they are to retain their strong female customer base they need to modernise and change with the times as the national wi spokeswoman was quoted as saying the wi is always evolving it needs to move with the times otherwise the organisation would die wi lite is the latest racy chapter in the history of the evolving wi a story that was brought to the public eye in the form of the film calendar girls which immortalised the reallife story of the women who inspired by personal tragedy became the pioneers of a new radical style of womens institute which combined social activism and community conscience with fun friendship and female empowerment wi lite is a sign not just that ladette culture is penetrating the parts that traditionalists might not expect it to have reached it is skilfully putting together a package that speaks to the aspirations interests and needs of a new generation even if in this case it is actually rebranding more or less the same product the wi fundraising calendar in its publicity material wi lite explicitly appeals to a new generation declares it embraces the traditional but tongue kisses the modern this is the confident sexually assertive voice of the new generation if wi lite is using humour and a light touch to tap peoples consciences and pockets for noble local causes they have my support as samantha that fictional torchbearer for the sex and the city generation whose experience of cancer radicalised her and others when she threw off her wig at a charity fundraiser would say you go girls,2008-09,womens life changed make sense public space woman network congregrate changed ha news bramley branch womens institute ha rival

i was never really interested in boys as a girl i was an extremely boring child i was always either drawing or doing my homework i went to ballroomdancing classes on a monday evening in rochester where you met boys but i was not to go out with anyone whom my mother hadnt met in advance my parents in their youth were ballroomdancing champions and of course they met while ballroom dancing when my mother died of lung cancer my father found his second wife ballroom dancing too it was the s so for me dancing wasnt necessarily romantic the girls would stand on one side of the room and the boys on the other and you had to hope that one of the boys would ask you to dance then take you to the local coffee shop they were usually the boys from the local grammar school so i considered them educated which was important to me my father was a lorry driver and i was very conscious of the fact that i didnt want to go out with anyone like him i didnt get on with my father my mother was an exotic type of person who liked having fun but he was always complaining just like alf garnett i think in todays atmosphere they would have divorced but their unhappiness was always hidden swept underneath i didnt have a boyfriend till i was about the only film star that i thought was to die for was the young marlon brando in a streetcar named desire and on the waterfront i thought he was magnificent and still theres nothing like seeing brando after hes been beaten up staggering about and looking quite fantastic but im never really attracted by looks im attracted by power and success by selfmade people who have built up empires to me thats really attractive my partner is somewhat older than me but hes an extremely amazing man who left school at the age of in egypt and ended up as president of warner brothers hes the guy who founded the multiplex cinema ive been with him for years hes a truly inspirational thinker and it was through him that i created my museum i had a much older boyfriend for a couple of years when i was before i got into the royal college i suppose yes it was the first time i fell in love i think falling in love represents a very difficult phase in ones life though because it interferes with your work thats what makes it difficult so the older you get and the less you have to prove with your career the easier it is i believe the only thing in life that doesnt let you down is your work youve always got to be prepared for the human element to ruin things ive been heartbroken ive had relationships where ive pleaded with the man to stay and ive been very upset to recover i then pushed myself back into my work to let that sadness go i think men are much more insecure than they make out and i think that in the main a successful woman has to bow down to a man if they want the relationship to work men cant cope with a successful woman i accept the difficulty of the balancing act because im quite old and wise now and because my partners a lot older than me so to some extent its all right our successes are not the easiest things to balance but i think in a sense the wife has to always be the supporter of the husband most of my friends are gay men at the top of their profession theyre people that i go on adventures with like andrew logan whos a sculptor we go on sketching trips we love to get up at dawn and sketch the moroccan sunrise zandra rhodes is currently working with sony on the new giga juke music system,2008-09,wa never really interested boy girl wa extremely boring child wa always either drawing homework went

today is the anniversary of a united nations security council resolution that if fully implemented could change the dynamics of war and peace eight years ago the un security council voted unanimously to pass resolution their first ever resolution to address the impact of war on women and womens contributions to conflict resolution and sustainable peace it calls for equal participation of women in all aspects of conflict prevention peace building and reconstruction prevention of violence against women and protection of the human rights of women and girls during times of conflict a similar resolution was passed by the european parliament in november with an accompanying recommendation calling for at least womens representation in all levels of decisionmaking in peace building and postconflict recovery both resolutions tackle full on the glaring fact that peacemaking is mostly in the hands of the worlds men peacemaking and peacebuilding ought not to be left so overwhelmingly to men for one practical reason men on their own are no good at it the record proves it arnold whittick who served in the infantry in france in the first world war was lecturer to hm forces on reconstruction in the second world war writing about the versailles treaty peace talks he said some might reflect sadly that if womens influence had been stronger there might have been no second world war but one does not write history with ifs in todays troubled world more than of all conflicts break out all over again within years the problem derives in part from deeply flawed peacemaking attempts in which women are underrepresented in ongoing toplevel decisionmaking on peace and statebuilding processes while men who are more likely to be the wagers of war are overrepresented the other reason women should be equal partners in peacebuilding is to ensure issues of importance to womens lives as well as mens are high on the agenda such as personal security and safety infrastructure and services livelihood and employment property rights food security needs of widows and female former combatants political representation and decision making and preventing impunity for rape there have been pockets of progress on making work at grassroots and middle levels unfpa unifem and the office of the high commissioner for human rights have been working with womens ngos and national governments to implement unscr the uk and other un member states have drawn up national action plans for the extreme disappointment is at the top levels where it counts government ministers politicians and diplomats have consistently failed to insist women be included as equal partners at the top table in peace talks they have also failed to appoint women heads of un missions out of current peace operations peacekeeping political and peacebuilding missions there is only one female chief of mission the un secretary generals special representative to liberia ellen margrethe lj from denmark women also continue to be frozen out from toptable peace talks despite energetic courageous lobbying by female ngo leaders in wartorn countries demanding to be included exasperated at women on both sides not being treated as equal partners with men at the top table of the middle east peace talks israeli women have told me they are on the verge of challenging their own government in the law courts this step is unprecedented in sri lanka womens groups lobbied both domestic political leaders and the norwegians who were acting as peacebrokers to bring the countrys interminable civil war to an end but these women werent included at the top table and the killing goes on in the balkans the international contact group brokering talks on the status of kosovo included four permanent members of the un security council the united states united kingdom france and russia yet they ignored their own resolution the ngo women in black in belgrade and on the other side the kosovo ngo network comprising womens ngos including the kosovo womens network demonstrated and lobbied their own politicians members of the european parliament and the international contact group for the right to be included as equal partners in negotiations result the contact group led by special envoy and now noble peace prize laureate marti ahtisaari ignored the balkan womens peaceful requests equal participation of women and men in conflict prevention and peace talks would be a natural next step to a precedent that has already emerged in postconflict parliamentary elections in which womens ngos have lobbied hard for a gender balance quota with the result that one third of countries with more than women in parliament are countries recovering from conflict including rwanda mozambique nepal burundi uganda angola south africa even afghanistan and iraq have a higher percentage of women in parliament than in the united kingdoms house of commons the old view that women in conflict zones are victims rather than an immense prospective resource for bringing conflict to an end must be overcome readers can help to give peace a chance every time there are peace talks anywhere from the congo to

the government was warned today not to backslide on taking measures to close the gender pay gap after a new poll showed widespread public support for tackling the issue nine out of of those questioned by the fawcett society campaign group and the unison trade union said the government should do more to tackle the pay gap the labour partys traditional advantage on equal pay was starting to slip according to the report with its lead over the conservatives and liberal democrats on this issue falling over the past year around two thirds said their voting choices at the next general election would be influenced by political action on equal pay according to the survey of men and of women said the government needed to do more to ensure women were paid the same as men for doing jobs that required the same or similar levels of skill the fawcett society said the gender pay gap meant that women would in effect be working for free from now until the rest of the year dubbing today womens no pay day equal pay campaigners want lord mandelson the business secretary to include provisions in the new equality bill to make firms hold pay audits to expose any disparities between men and womens wages katherine rake the fawcett societys director said this poll sends a clear message to peter mandelson that any backtracking on equality commitments is going against popular thinking in

up to an astonishing of gdp with the equality bill lord mandelson has an opportunity to support measures that make financial sense during this economic downturn bronwyn mckenna a unison official said

womens groups have reacted angrily to a government admission that victims of domestic and sexual violence have been omitted from its social exclusion agenda ann watt deputy director of the social exclusion task force told a national cabinetsupported conference last week that information was too patchy for domestic violence to be featured in a public service delivery agreement that aims to increase the proportion of socially excluded adults in settled accommodation and employment education or training but womens groups are incensed because they argue that victims of domestic and sexual violence underreport and are already marginalised from mainstream services helen rice chair of the womens resource centre wrc said are they really saying that victims of domestic violence are too socially excluded to be included by the social exclusion taskforce basically what theyre saying is that we cant be bothered to find out any more data because actually its too hard if they havent got the data then its their job surely to get the data otherwise that group will remain socially excluded she warned that the omission meant that when local area agreements are formed it wont be a priority for local authorities to include domestic violence in their strategic planning the wrc which supports and trains womens organisations argues that sufficient data does exist and it criticises the government for pigeonholing violence against women into criminal justice which it says misses out other crucial impacts domestic violence can have on womens health employment and education nicola harwin chief executive of womens aid said her organisation had been collecting data for the past years and called for a review of the entire public service delivery agreements psas in which she believed that domestic violence suffered too low a profile psa from which domestic violence is excluded is one of psas set out in the comprehensive spending review that reflect the governments top priorities and help determine which issues local authorities will fund it focuses on four vulnerable groups adults with secondary mental health problems adults with moderate to severe learning disabilities offenders under probation supervision and care leavers a cabinet spokesman said at the time we were developing this psa we had to find robust local authority level data on employment and accommodation rates for each of the target groups unfortunately we were not able to get the data we needed on victims of domestic violence its the first psa on socially excluded adults and we knew that it would not include every vulnerable group,2008-10,womens group reacted angrily government admission victim domestic sexual violence omitted social exclusion agenda ann watt deputy director

although i cant agree with the broad theme of jr shackletons article the gender pay gap is not for real in the sunday times last weekend i have to say that i welcomed his contribution to the debate on equal pay not because i thought he brought any new and startling insight to the issue but because his comments give me an opportunity to clear up some common misconceptions about the gender pay gap i actually find myself agreeing with one or two of his comments yes women often do choose the lowerpaid professions yes some areas like engineering are totally dominated by men yes women often dont negotiate good pay packets and shy away from asking for more money but none of these points mean that there is no gender pay gap they just demonstrate some of the reasons for it lets take this issue of career preference professor shackleton is correct when he says that women are choosing jobs in less wellpaid sectors but instead of accepting this as a fact of life i want to do something about it thats why when i announced the conservative partys fair play on equal pay policy i made it a priority to improve careers advice for girls why are our young women who outperform boys at school and university opting for lowerpaid jobs and why are some areas still seen as the preserve of men i think its because their options may be limited by a lack of information and aspiration we want to empower young women to feel able to go down any career path and likewise with his point that women dont negotiate good pay for themselves we shouldnt penalise them for that lack of confidence or awareness of their rights we should bring in compulsory pay audits for employers found guilty of discrimination to protect those women i also agree with professor shackleton that this isnt just about plain discrimination by employers although a report by the governments gender and equality unit found that discrimination is the most dominant factor it is far more complex than that and that is why we want to institute a culture change traditional working patterns are based on a time when men went out to work and had a wife at home doing the housework and childcare not all families can afford that luxury now and many women have had careers prechildren so want to work likewise men want to take on more of a role in family life so dismissing enhanced flexible working and help with childcare as a waste of time shows a lack of imagination and awareness of what modern families need and want there are some really key issues here around female aspiration saying that the pay gap in the uk isnt that bad when compared with other countries or is getting better or is the result of womens choices dismisses the real issue which is that many women are being paid unfairly while we recognise that women taking five years out to have children cant expect to come back to work and automatically be on a level with their male colleagues who didnt we also recognise that we need women to have children we cant afford to shut down the talent of half the adults in this country and we also need to do more to share the burden of childcare between both parents and ill end on one final note of impatience the gender pay gap is not closing a report out last month from the chartered management institute said women across the uk will have to wait years before their takehome pay outpaces men addressing this isnt about empowering the resentful its about having the good sense to create a fairer working life for everyone for more info please join my facebook campaign theresa may for equal

anyone who is worried about peaches geldof who ran off to las vegas and married a man she had only just met should heed the wise words of david niven in honeymoons are a great institution for getting to know ones spouse peaches is on the cover of the latest issue of heat magazine talking about her surprise trip to the little white wedding chapel with max drummey allowing the newspapers all over again to cluck nervously that this man was simply her boyfriend of a month a whole month niven would think that these two left it so long to get married they spoiled the magic back in a swedish woman called hjordis tersmeden accidentally sat in nivens chair on the set of bonnie prince charlie he noticed her uptilted nose and enormous grey eyes and married her days later hjordis didnt speak english at the time in his autobiography niven mentions this as a problem when it came to explaining to the marriage authorities that she had landed in england en route from america to sweden as the plane had been grounded because of sudden fog and a friend on board had invited her to visit a film studio im not surprised he can barely explain it in english himself but niven does not mention the language barrier as any kind of obstacle to deciding on nine days acquaintance that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with hjordis her nose did the talking with skills like that she could have had a great broadway career of her own and spend the rest of his life with her he did the couple were still together having adopted two daughters and moved to switzerland when he died in one assumes that her nose still tilted and her eyes hadnt got any smaller so david was happy unlike peaches geldof and max drummey the premarital nivens had not even made the effort to communicate on myspace not speaking the same language they hadnt communicated at all and peaches offers reasons for marrying max which are even stronger than the eyesnose argument he graduated from harvard with honours in social anthropology and can play instruments doesnt he sound great this is a man who could deliver a lecture on the psychology of shopping while accompanying himself on the panpipes that would get you through the first winter together at least people have cited mr and mrs drummey as examples of modern youths feckless disrespectful attitude to marriage i hope they will note david nivens words from years ago and realise that this is actually a charming oldfashioned elegant tradition marry first get to know each other later thats how we did it for centuries arranged marriage cultures still do and broadly speaking they dont seem any unhappier than the rest of us if you ask me getting married on a whim drunk aged to somebody you barely know is the only way of doing it if i had my life over again thats what id do if i had children thats what i would advise them but i dont have children because ive been loitering timidly by the open doorway for so long that ill probably never jump out of the plane pause to think about it and you just sit back down and buckle your seatbelt perhaps the tabloids would prefer peaches to hit without marrying anyone give her a chance to get used to the single life taking her own space own sleep patterns own choices own holidays own friends own family completely for granted allow the idea of sharing all this with somebody else forever to become a bit nerveracking let her come to believe that having left it so long it would now be really stupid to make a mistake let her take the whole thing so damn seriously that instead of acting without thinking she constantly thinks without acting all thirtysomethings do is date for years too scared of abandoning selfsufficiency to take things any further until the other persons flaws perfectly tolerable if they had already made the commitment become giant looming reasons not to marry them anyway or they get married and are so shocked by the unfamiliar compromises of permanent partnership they have to get divorced again do you remember when britney spears ran off to vegas got pissed pulled a frilly garter over her jeans and married a man called jason best thing she ever did we sat in the car revealed the groom and we were like are we gonna do this yeah were gonna do it im not saying this is every girls dream proposal he was down on one knee at the time but only because hed slipped drunkenly off the passenger seat but jason was a normal quiet footballplaying student from britneys home town what a fantastic choice she accidentally made it was like downing a bottle of vodka and staggering out to buy a sensible pair of brogues and get a flu jab the next day britneys mother flew to nevada and demanded an annulment in gods name why ill bet you anything you like that now four years later as britney lurches between crisis and rehab her mum is constantly saying why cant you settle down and get married to a nice boy from round here and jason went along with the annulment very happily what on earth was he thinking oh dear i have accidentally married a beautiful young starlet with a personal fortune of million dollars i must rectify this terrible mistake immediately max and peaches are quite right to make the jump before theyve had a chance to look down i hope theyll be very happy and if theyre not well at least they wont have to blame their own careful judgment

indian women may be climbing the global power lists but that doesnt stop our top politicos from rapping us on the knuckles for straying from where we belong home earlier this month soumya vishwanathan a television journalist in delhi was killed on her way back from work so far we know little except that it was around three in the morning and she was shot from a moving vehicle delhi chief minister sheila dikshit said she regretted vishwanathans death but felt that she should not have been so adventurous now shes appealing to employers to ensure safety for female employees because of course cleaning up the city known to be notoriously unsafe for women would take too much work vishwanathans death may not have been related to her gender but the debate on womens safety has been churned up with many echoing dikshits sentiments this is not new as indian women step into newfound freedom there are frequents attempts to bind our feet three years back when a call centre worker in bangalore was raped and killed by the driver of the company car a flurry of voices advised women to avoid night shifts in karnataka the law prohibits women from working at night in most industries media and the itenabled services industry are exceptions recently when the karnataka high court repealed a ban on female bartenders the police cautioned that crimes against women would increase feminists protest against such regressive attitudes and laws and with good reason by shifting responsibility from the state to the individual woman they make society more unsafe in the long run when something happens to a woman the kneejerk reaction is to assume that she is the miscreant the breaker of rules by curtailing womens freedom and mobility they impede our ability to compete in an economy that has to keep up with a global clock a professional handicap that increases our dependence on men as financial providers the fear factor makes women physically and psychologically dependent exacerbates a sense of victimhood and encourages helplessness its harder for women to engage in social activities build support systems or get involved in political or community issues im not advocating that we sacrifice ourselves on the altar of bravado and womens lib but isnt it time to give the blame back where it belongs our cities are unsafe and this is largely due to poor infrastructure dingy alleys badlylit streets poor public transport and inadequate or unresponsive policing as a recent planning commission report said funny thing because there are occasions when cops swarm the streets when a political bigwig comes visiting for example during public festivals processions the rare gay pride march clearly womens safety is not so high on the priority list because no matter what the situation is its presented as though it is womens fault for not toeing the cinderella line its our fault for not asking employers for special privileges its our fault for venturing out in the first place what madam dikshit and others like her would do well to remember is that in most indian cities stepping out alone anytime after dark constitutes adventurousness for a woman safe streets should be a basic right not a luxury it would be heartening if one felt that the government was taking the problem seriously and making some moves in the right direction but sadly year after year all we get is the same old blame game some sanctimonious advice a few regressive laws and no promises not even empty ones,2008-10,indian woman may climbing global power list doesnt stop top politico rapping u knuckle straying

pat pattinson there are two postcards i treasure because both were instrumental in changing my life the first is one i sent to my old university boyfriend when i noticed his details in our alumni magazine years after we broke up in it i say rather breezily dear john just seen your address in the newsletter how are you ive been teaching in the education department of utrecht university for the past years id love to hear your news we had met when john was sweeping up leaves around the campus to earn a bit of extra money and i was sunbathing outside our halls but we broke up two years later because he wanted to have a family and i wanted to travel i didnt really expect him to reply to the postcard but he did and we corresponded briefly for months he told me that he had worked as a civil servant and lived in australia for a while had married and gone on to have four children but he had since got divorced i on the other hand had worked mostly in europe teaching and although i had had several relationships had never married preferring to keep my independence then one evening i answered my door to find john on my doorstep he had been on a sailing holiday with his brother and was just passing i remember feeling embarrassed to be wearing an old tracksuit which he has since told me he found very sexy we spent the next few days catching up things might have stayed on an oldfriends basis if on the last evening i hadnt recklessly lit candles opened a bottle of wine and put on a jacques brel record with predictable results we continued our relationship for another years going back and forth between holland and england several times john asked me to marry him but i worried about losing my autonomy then when i retired in which was a leap year i decided to use a womans privilege to change her mind i wrote him a jokey postcard saying darling shall we continue our champagne lifestyle in legal matrimony or as toyboy and concubine he returned the card immediately saying matrimony every time darling thanks for asking we have been married four years and for our honeymoon made a roundtheworld trip which we enjoyed so much that we did it again we both feel incredibly lucky to have met up again as we did thanks to my casual postcard thats why im hanging on to it michelle williamshuw until recently i kept a whole bag of letters from friends and family who wrote to me when i was having treatment for breast cancer a year ago in it they say encouraging things about me and how they know ill come out the other end i took great comfort in them but a while ago i sat down read through them all then threw most of them away as i feel that now im in remission ive moved on from being the cancer patient but i kept a couple including this one because it was pivotal in my journey it is a simple note from my mother valerie to my husband which she wrote when i was sixth months into my treatment after two lumpectomies and while having chemotherapy which made my hair fall out and when i thought i was losing my grip in it she tells him i just wanted to let you know as sometimes we dont say these things that the last few months have been very traumatic for all of us i just want you to know that the way you have taken care of my daughter and looked after my grandchildren has made me feel very very proud of you it makes me feel much better knowing you are beside her when my husband rhodri read it he had a tear in his eye even though the sentiment was simple it had a huge impact on me too it made me cry because i suddenly realised that i had been so absorbed in my journey that i hadnt noticed rhodri had been on one too i had spent so much time thinking about myself that i forgot to think about how he might be feeling to be honest part of me was frightened to think that he might be scared too because if he was feeling like that who the hell was going to look after me when i had the meltdowns it made me realise that i had to open up and admit that i was vulnerable something i wasnt used to and ask about how he was feeling and face that after this letter we did change becoming much more communicative with each other and having some uncomfortable conversations about real things such as living and dying being together and about the children we had created the life we wanted to lead and the people we wanted to be we also needed to acknowledge that in the space of eight months since the diagnosis our lives had changed irrevocably when i first got the news about the cancer and woke up in the night crying rhodri had told me off for waking him up although he did later say sorry but this note reminds me of how he turned from that boy who found it difficult to comfort me in the middle of the night to a man who can stand by my side and make me feel that no matter what happens we can face it together you can read more of michelles story in my mummy wears a wig does yours by michelle williamshuw accent press caroline hughes you stupid pigheaded irrational bloody woman cant you understand get it into your thick woolly head that i have behaved in this way simply and only because i love you love you from the tips of your hair to your toes for christs sake i am frightened to death scared stiff finished i cant cope with a world that doesnt have you in it ive kept this letter for years as i like to remember that someone once felt so passionate about me it is from the man i was having an affair with at the age of we met at work and i had left my husband of years to live with him because i felt he really understood me was my real soul mate unlike my husband from whom id gradually grown apart who was rather oldfashioned in his attitudes to women my lover and i had run away together to start a new life in the west country however i got cold feet and out of guilt returned to my husband and our yearold son this letter goes on in the same vein for about four pages the emptiness and pain are unbearable i can be just driving along the road and the tears just go go go and i cant stop i love you love you love you and cannot ever envisage not loving you never i would do anything to see you hold you kiss you i was so overwhelmed by the letter and his subsequent attempts to draw me back that i finally decided to leave my husband for good after the letter we lived together and eventually married and had our sonnow however it took a long time to come to terms with the guilt of leaving my first husband then two years ago after years together he suddenly left me to live with a younger woman i begged him to return but he refused and we have since divorced i havent stopped loving him though and so ive kept this letter we are on speaking terms now but i dont think ill ever be able to forgive him its hard to believe that someone who had written such lovely things could leave me so carelessly unlike him when i promised to love him for ever i meant it sarah watts it was weird opening this letter because apart from never having seen my natural mums handwriting before a photograph of her slipped out the first time i clapped eyes on her she posted it the night i had first talked to her on the phone she wrote hope you slept well last night and arent too hyped up i am still trying to believe that i have spoken to you it just seems so much like all my dreams no words can describe how i felt or feel i always knew i had been adopted my mother had given me a photograph of myself at the age of six months explaining that this was the picture my birth mum had of me i researched it a bit when i was but it was only when i reached and i had my own three children a girl and twin boys in the space of a year that i started to think more seriously about my natural mother apart from the fact that the doctors kept asking about my medical history and i didnt know anything i felt such overwhelming love and protection for my children that i wondered what could have been so bad in her life that she had wanted to give me up i contacted norcap the charity that helps adults who are affected by adoption and gave the few details i had from my birth certificate for a small fee they agreed to do a search i couldnt believe how simple it was within a few months they were able to track down my mother as she still lived in the same area of yorkshire with my agreement the norcap intermediary wrote to her sending a short description of my life and asking if she would like to meet me she responded immediately and rang me that same night i was surprisingly calm at first but what struck me most was that her voice was like mine she told me that she was a vicars daughter and had got pregnant accidentally with an older boyfriend she went to a motherandbaby home where she had given me up at six weeks old unfortunately she had little information about my birth father and didnt seem to be able to remember much about him although on the adoption form it described him rather comically as a stout but jolly fellow but she did say that she had felt very sad about giving me away and although she married twice she had never had any more children of her own she still treasured my white matinee jacket with the name tag still attached and the photograph of me that my adoptive mother had sent her next day i got the letter and the photograph of her i was so surprised that although she wore glasses and dressed differently to me she looked just like me the same eyes lips and shape of face more than that there was something inherently familiar about her she was very solicitous of my feelings in her letter saying over the years ive always said to myself that i must never pry into your life if i was ever lucky enough to speak to you and i hope that you dont feel i did i have since gone on to meet megan in person and to match up the two baby photographs we both treasured ive also introduced her to my children and my mother although she can never replace my real mum meeting her has made me feel much more settled its as though i know where i am in the scheme of things i now know what comes before me and what comes after and it feels good some names have been changed,2008-10,pat pattinson two

family structure doesnt matter is a favourite labour mantra the governments keenness to distance itself from tory family ideals is understandable and on the basis of equality in principle more appealing there is a problem with labours diversity embracing position however and that is that its inadvertently also embracing deprivation trends in uk family structure today reveal distinct economic class differences bringing home the fact that in reality parenting choices are not equally spread across society the latest findings from the millennium cohort study mcs a nationally representative survey of the families of babies born around the year provide a pertinent illustration of how socioeconomic class affects families in this country the findings published today are from the studys third sweep gathered when the millennium babies were five years old the studys first sweep when the cohort were nine months old revealed a stark relationship between family structure and economics at the time of birth of married parents of cohabiting parents and of single parents lived in the wards classified as advantaged by contrast of married parents of cohabiting parents and of single parents lived in the disadvantaged wards the most striking difference was the relative unlikelihood of parents being married in the poorer areas of the uk the answer to well so what is the comparative instability of those unmarried families which is acutely apparent in the latest findings when the researchers returned to the mcs families in the cohabiting parents were considerably more likely to have separated than the married parents while of those children living with both their married parents at nine months were still doing so at five years old this was the case for only of those children whose parents were cohabiting when they were nine months the significance of this comparative instability among cohabiting parents is especially important when we look at the contributions of nonresident parents in the study generally the fathers just of nonresident fathers were in frequent contact with their five year olds and over half of nonresident fathers were not paying any maintenance aside from the implications for parenting equality the widespread lack of contribution on the part of fathers heightens financial strains on families that are already disproportionately likely to be struggling as the mcs illustrates families in disadvantaged areas are vulnerable to a pileup of instability where age income and opportunity are implicated for them the diverse family seems to equate less with choice than labour likes to imagine lowerincome families are likely to be younger a contrast with the increasingly older middle class parent connected to education and work opportunities as the betteroff postpone childbearing until after higher education and career priorities for those with fewer opportunities this is less often a consideration linked to this while the affluent are more likely to strive for comparative stability in their lives before starting a family stable circumstances are not always seen to be attainable to the less welloff with marriage roughly translating as making a commitment when circumstances are conducive to doing so the age and affluence difference between the unmarried and married parents makes sense in light of these patterns highlighted by the mcs but replicated in much other research family structure should in fact matter a great deal to the government while labour is right to want to treat all families

as a boy i was never especially masculine i never relished willy jokes ive always been a bit of a girl and still am in many ways my foray into the arts was an extension of my girlishness people used to quake at the thought of me heading all these bbc departments being the sort of person i am thinking does he really know what hes talking about i grew up in a vast jewish matriarchy in manchester jewish families are often dominated by women i had lots of aunts and a wonderful grandmother and i spent most of my childhood in a chaotic kitchen full of women immigrants and foreign languages naturally i was fascinated by women from a young age the first one to turn my head was the mother of a friend at my school i was about seven years old and i was besotted with her she was very sophisticated and didnt talk down to me in fact she told me my first dirty joke why did the psychiatrist put his wife under the bed because he thought she was a little potty of course thats actually incredibly tame but it was the most exciting thing id heard i count sexual relationships and flings as relationships and ive never cheated on anyone in my adult life i dont want to be sanctimonious about other peoples relationships but i find its the women who are more loyal than men loyalty is very important and i am an incredibly loyal person i think that having ingratiated myself into being the only nonoxbridge intern at the bbc when i was and having been there ever since the bbc has in return allowed me to blossom consequently ive made sure women get more of a look in i suppose i am prejudiced towards them they improve a workplace women prioritise their family yet are able to hold down incredibly demanding creative jobs far better than men i met my wife documentarymaker philippa walker in the bbc canteen shes another strong woman philippas quite outspoken so yes she wears some of the trousers but thats because shes an incredibly capable woman we havent worked together and we

i didnt have boyfriends until my late teens i was at a girls boarding school and my stepfather disapproved of me going out with anybody i never really came across any boys when i did one of them asked me out and i was petrified i felt like a fish out of water and it was excruciating my father was with us in the family until i was but i dont have any recollection of him talking to me or communicating with me he was very remote hed been a pilot in the war and i think he was slightly damaged george harrison and i met when i was after two years we had a nice house and we were decorating it together and it seemed like a natural progression to get married george was the first person that i properly fell in love with he almost felt like a brother ive got three brothers and i felt very easy in his company and he was great fun it was my ideal of what a family life would be but i wasnt able to have children men find it more difficult than women to be alone they function better with someone in their lives being married they are rooted so they feel safe to go and do what they want to do when i married eric clapton i was dealing with someone who was not well due to alcohol abuse so a lot of the time i had the upper hand which i didnt like but it was a role that i became used to and then i needed it i needed him to be ill for me to feel in control and thats a sick relationship i think both of the men i married were so unfaithful and destructive because they were adored by hundreds and thousands of people its very seductive and easy to misbehave am i as much to blame probably because i didnt put my foot down i didnt feel that i had the right to it takes two to tango and i suppose in a way i colluded with the effect of their huge fame i think men are mainly unfaithful because as they get older they feel the urge to prove to themselves that they are still attractive they need proof from outside the marriage its really sad its all about them its not about their wives at all with george and eric it was simply because they had women telling them how wonderful they were all the time women make the mistake of thinking that sex is love men are able to be a bit more detached about it i read erics autobiography and his description of our marriage his reflection of it is much colder than i believed he felt at the time i fell into his seductive trap and i believed it whereas reading his book it seemed like he had forgotten how he was when we were together women hang onto the romanticism of a relationship but a man compartmentalises it into the past and then gets on with his new life i wasnt very happy with his version of events id say i had the greatest passion and chemistry of my life with george i think i was a romantic inspiration to eric and george because i gave as much as i could to them both to the detriment of myself i was always there for them which i think is really what a muse is you are living your life for somebody else i dont know if one has choices about men or whether life is mapped out for us and you meet somebody and there is chemistry and thats it you think youve chosen them but maybe you were meant to be with them anyway but i do know that i wouldnt go for somebody now who drinks too much id like to go for a man who is a grownup but there are not many of them thats why im on my own pattieboydcouk,2008-11,didnt boyfriend

how disappointing that lucy mangan shortcuts g november chose to ridicule the work of the womens institute an organisation which since has represented the interests of hundreds of thousands of rural

too short and with a good hard work ethic a certain breed of women would swap their toes for a lesson from miss dabovic i met a woman who had booked a wedding reception near the princess castle in disneyland paris before she had even met a partner these are women who go to their weddings in pink pumpkinshaped carriages they hanker after proposals alpha businesswoman has had five marriage proposals to date shes and single recently when i had two marriage proposals in one week i too unlocked the secret to pinning down a potential husband these are the conventional rules for bagging a bridegroom remember men like an ultimatum describe what happy family life he will have draw his attention to married friends and their cosy settled lives get his parents on side dont give up ignore these rules at all costs boro proposed to me last week we were sailing along a west african river in a boat that looked like half a coconut shell and was about as stable there were crocodiles in the water but boro promised they were vegetarians to settle my nerves we chatted i told him about grey boring england and he asked if id like to stay in africa i bumbled on a bit about the great way of life until he put down his oar and said you will marry me it wasnt a question it was a statement of fact then thank god our canoe beached in the shallows and i made a quick getaway a friend had a similar experience in tanzania her safari driver gave her a cassette tape with swahili lyrics that translated as i love you before proposing she had a year of a medical degree left so thought better

a bustling atmosphere fills the community centre in bristol as a group of women busily collate statistics create collages and chat about their findings they are compiling the results of a monthlong project exploring why women feature so rarely in serious news stories yet turn up so regularly in naked pictures they have gathered a huge pile of information from newspapers and magazines and some group members have also been carrying out a subversive flyer campaign going into newsagents and replacing the sexualised images found on lads magazine covers with a photograph of a man to this they have added the words lads mags present a onedimensional view of sexuality these women are members of the bristol feminist network bfn a discussion and activism group set up last year by sally cosgrove the network brings together people of all ages to talk about feminist issues and plan direct action which has so far included a prochoice demo and an equal pay protest it acts as a natural extension of the consciousnessraising groups that sprang up during the s and s offering a space where women can talk freely about how discrimination affects their daily lives and work out how to change this cosgrove started the group in after volunteering to help organise the feminist festival ladyfest bristol inspired by meeting so many political women she sounded out interest in holding a regular discussion group and on receiving a positive response quickly set up a facebook and yahoo group since then the network has gone from strength to strength and now has members prochoice activist katy ladbrook is one of them and she says that an essential benefit of the group is being able to organise around an incredibly broad range of issues she first became involved as a way to reach more activists it was a great resource to disseminate information about abortion rights and prochoice events but then i continued to be involved as i really enjoyed having the space to talk about all the issues i care about she says that it is easy to feel politically isolated in an age in which feminism is often regarded as a dirty word but an organisation such as the bfn offers the chance to meet a large group of likeminded progressive people bristol isnt the only city with such a popular group there are new feminist networks forming around the uk providing a stark riposte to the notion that feminist thought and activism has long since snuffed it the glasgow feminist network gfn for instance has around members ranging in age from to and other groups include the waves in cardiff and the edinburgh feminist network then theres the london feminist network lfn one of the largest womens rights groups in the country which numbers around members one of the founders of the gfn is charlotte cameron who says that what spurred her to start the group was a growing frustration with the sexism and misogyny i experienced and observed on a daily basis i couldnt find any groups in the city that were trying to counter it so myself and a few other women set up the network its wonderful to see how inspired older women are to meet young feminists after theyve been told for so long that feminism is irrelevant and young feminists dont exist weve organised lots of events workshops film screenings direct actions and one of the most important things weve done in the last year was the vigil we held after the murders of local women eleni pachou and moira jones and a string of sexual assaults that was attended by around people and was really moving the lfn proved its might last weekend when women marched through london for reclaim the night an annual protest against rape and violence which is organised by the network the group was started by feminist activist finn mackay in and it has set up feminist conferences film festivals and a protest outside the playboy shop in london while mackays prime focus as a campaigner is addressing male violence against women pornography prostitution domestic abuse female genital mutilation forced marriage and socalled honour crimes lfn members campaign on these and many other feminist issues besides one of its members is the comedian kate smurthwaite who points out that a key advantage of these groups is the sheer strength of numbers the power of being in touch with over feminists means that if we want something to happen we can spread the word about an event or an issue and make it happen she says referring to the parliamentary challenge to the time limit on abortion which took place earlier this year smurthwaite says that she believes that the prochoice demos which were organised through the network really made a difference to the way politicians were prepared to look at the issue the power of these groups is also in the alliances that they build both between individual members and with longstanding singleissue feminist organisations the gfn works in tandem with groups including glasgow womens aid the glasgow rape crisis centre and the womens support centre while members of the lfn are involved with a huge range of organisations i do a lot of work with the fawcett society abortion rights and object a group that challenges the objectification of women as well as activism with stop the strip pub says smurthwaite she points out that by forming these connections we can create a much bigger noise which is the essential aim sue tate is a member of the bfn and an art lecturer at the university of the west of england and has been involved in feminist activism since the s she says that the bfn represents a new generation for her and that shell only believe that were living in a postfeminist age when discrimination against women is entirely a thing of the past until then she says these networks are vital to

today is the united nations day for the eradication of violence against women to be followed by days of global activism on the issue ho hum i hear the gentlemen of the press muttering most mornings i listen to bbc radio s today programme the flagship agendasetter for the days news in recent months listening as the show reported extensively on yet another youth stabbing the question frequently bubbling inside me is why dont the media cover the violent murders of women killed by their partners in the same way these murderers are rarely thrown into the media spotlight while each time a youth is murdered the event is treated with shock and outrage and given headline status a small minority of victims of domestic violence and murder are men but in four out of five domestic murders it is women who are victimised just look at the statistics violence against women is a pandemic more extensive than hivaids it is the main cause of death and disability globally for women aged to rape and gross bodily violence cause more death and permanent disability than cancer motor vehicle accidents war and malaria combined why the difference in media coverage and political outrage in the uk alone between one and two women are killed each week by a current partner or expartner the number of women murdered each year by their partner or expartner is higher than the number of youngsters knifed to death in london and other british cities last year alone women were murdered by a violent partner or expartner compared to youths knifed to death would anyone have guessed at those comparative stats doubtful there is deeply inadequate attention paid by press and parliament to the everyday horror of many womens lives even in this civilised country astonishingly women are more at risk of violence in intimate relationships than anywhere else according to the world health organisation more than of women in bangladesh ethiopia peru and tanzania were subjected to physical or sexual violence by intimate partners in the uk the extent of violence against women from their partners and expartners is way in excess of teenage stabbings one in four women in the uk will experience domestic violence in their lifetime one domestic violence incident is reported to the police every minute the total cost of domestic violence to services is estimated to be bn and the cost to the economy is bn what is the underlying reason for these double standards in media coverage is it that the media and british society consider the murder of a teenage youth more shocking than the murder of a woman by her oncenearest and dearest thirty years ago many people including editors and journalists were unaware of the existence of domestic violence or even felt it was normal and ok for a man to beat his wife or girlfriend in those days the police were not even supposed to intervene in what was euphemistically termed a domestic unlike their predecessors todays editors and journalists can no longer plead ignorance of the topic in the late s and early s campaigner erin pizzey put the issue of domestic violence in the public domain she founded chiswick womens aid since then womens organisations such as the fawcett society southall black sisters refuge womens aid and more recently the mens white ribbon campaign have all drawn attention to this horrific hidden silent spring of violence all violence whether it is against men or women or children is unacceptable in a civilised society in the uk much of our progress on human rights and justice have been helped forward by our free media journalists and editors have a moral and journalistic duty virtually a hippocratic oath to name and shame the perpetrators of this cowardly crime otherwise it sends a message that violence against women is still accepted and acceptable a normal part of family life and thus not newsworthy,2008-11,today united nation day eradication violence woman followed day global activism issue ho hum hear gentleman press

what makes a feminist icon according to the grizzlehaired grandedame of feminism germaine greer the answer may be an ample behind appearing on gordon ramsays cookalong last week greer outraged the likes of observer columnist barbara ellen by claiming that girls aloud singer cheryl cole could not be considered a feminist icon because theres not enough of her shes too thin asked to elaborate on this newly invented lackoffat based feministyardstick greer explained that a healthy girl is a fatbottomed creature which is a load of rubbish since when did feminism have anything to do with being healthy since the suffragettes first went on hungerstrike which must have gone some way to deflating their bottoms feminism has been a movement which is supposed to have held no truck with judging a woman by what she looks like and for greer to dismiss cole for being superlithe is particularly dishonest in the days when women would use copies of the female eunuch as instruments with which to beat their husbands germaine was as thin as a whippet and famous for taking her clothes off while an underground photographer pointed a lens at her unmentionables but who can be considered a modern feminist icon traditional feminists might cite andrea dworkin julie bindel or rosa luxembourg but do these names resonate with women casting about for icons in coles generation many feminists of the previous generation like greer now spend a great deal of time slating women of our generation fay weldon who once refused to wear a wedding ring now thinks girls should be compulsorily sterilised doris lessing who wrote the golden notebook now argues that it is men who are cowed in the sex war if feminist icons consist of women whose careers others can emulate and aspire to then surely the first female british prime minister margaret thatcher should be on the list or and the hackles shall rise the first ever female vicepresidential nominee of the republican party sarah palin neither may have got to their positions espousing any sort of feminist message but both coming from nowhere pulled themselves up by the brastraps and represent landmark achievements for womanhood another controversial choice would be julie burchill who was certainly empowered and definitely liberated leaving her second husband with nothing but a gramme of coke and a bust of lenin who once claimed that the most fun part of being a feminist is about frightening men other candidates will be equally unpopular are jordans breasts too big are madonnas thighs too stringy both are icons but are they feminists personally im flying the flag for tracey emin a most excellently talented woman who very unhealthily as well as being a real artist is also a consummate pissartist who scores of young female

i was a slop a slag and a whore says yearold zaina in a broad northern accent of how her violent exhusband viewed her the love marriage of her s soured when her gentle pakistani husband took up drugs and metamorphosed into an abuser zaina of asian heritage claims her husband beat her up on instruction by his mother who thought her daughterinlaw too westernised i couldnt talk to him he was changing says zaina he had a temper he was beating me up pulling my hair spitting my food was never good enough for him and not as good as his mothers yet despite years of violence including having a knife put to her throat and her young children nearly kidnapped by those to whom he owed money she says the police and support charities initially failed to help that third and fourth generation asians are now largely assimilated in the uk made little difference to how zaina was treated by both statutory and voluntary agencies i went to a support charity and theyd listen to my story write it down and i wouldnt get any help afterwards she says the police didnt help either i would sit in the station for hours and theyd just take a statement then never come back to see if i was dead or alive or they would tell my exhusband to leave instead of arresting him while i was there black and blue with bruises from punches they didnt take my domestic violence seriously the situation would be more credible if this were the s but zaina encountered it only three years ago before finally fleeing the extra barriers that black and minority ethnic bme women have to hurdle when fleeing domestic violence is the topic of a national conference next tuesday november to coincide with the united nations international day for the elimination of violence against women moving forward positioning culturally sensitive provision is being held by ashram housing association which runs domestic violence services and the university of wolverhampton the conference will explore why despite prevalence of domestic violence being similar across all communities bme women are less likely to access statutory services and then struggle with those they do receive some of the women we talk to are put off by presenting to larger statutory organisations such as the police or council domestic violence services because they feel they wont understand or respond sensitively says amanda nicholls deputy chief executive of ashram who is speaking at the conference she describes large mainstream groups as giants who often lack sensitivity understanding knowledge and skills that smaller specialist grassroots groups can provide groups she would like to see receive better funding and changing demographics in new immigrant communities from such countries as somalia and congo also threaten to reverse recent successes in reporting figures she says unclear immigration status and new language barriers stifle both reports and agency responses our client base is becoming increasingly diverse by the day says nicholls we dont want to go back to where weve come from in the s and s where there was a lack of reporting from these communities as a result of them not being dealt with sensitively funmi johnson national lead for the domestic violence project at the crown prosecution service agrees that immigration worries may gag women often theres an additional barrier preventing people reporting because they are concerned about their immigration status she says where this is not settled that becomes something the perpetrator can use as an additional method of control to say if you report this i will tell the authorities you will be deported and youll never see your children again nicki norman deputy chief executive of womens aid says there might be religious or cultural pressures not to seek help such as rejection from their own community as well as a valid fear of racism from authorities and where an organisation may not directly discriminate against them they may not take account of their individual needs she says norman adds that mainstream groups may tiptoe around bme women if they dont properly understand the different forms of abuse they experience such as sexual or physical violence from extended family forced marriage and honourbased violence there are other issues that agencies need to consider when dealing with bme women fleeing abuse claims priya chopra coordinator of saheli which works with asian women fleeing domestic violence with no recourse to public funds legal sponsored spouses coming to the uk to join their husbands or fiancs cannot claim welfare benefits for two years if their marriage breaks down into violence within this time and they cannot meet evidential requirements of this violence or if their sponsor does not renew their visa they get trapped within the immigration guidelines and face the choice of living with lifethreatening violence or facing destitution or deportation if they leave she says zaina is an example of someone who has managed to escape successfully picking up her life in a new town she commends her local police service now where she has a liaison officer and strong support from local charities but she wants authorities to reassure asian women too frightened to act that something will be done and that they can speak up dont be scared of no man she says not her real name,2008-11,wa slop slag whore say yearold zaina broad northern

women working full time will be paid less than their male counterparts over their lifetime it was claimed yesterday as new government figures emerged showing that the gender pay gap has widened over the past year men are now paid more than women for fulltime work a slight increase on last year while the disparity in parttime wages is up from in according to the office of national statistics annual survey of hours and earnings that lifetime disparity would be enough to pay for years of childcare or new cars the equality and human rights commission estimated or to pay off the average student debt times over katherine rake director of the fawcett society called the ons figures dire news for women after years of painfully slow progress in closing the pay gap we have now actually gone into reverse gear with the pay gap widening over for women working full and part time this sadly demonstrates that the government has failed to take serious action to combat discrimination still facing women in the labour market the world economic forum found this week that the uk had dropped from th to th in the global gender equality league table with sri lanka in th the annual survey ranks countries in terms of equality of economic participation access to education and healthcare and political empowerment that survey placed britain st in the world in terms of progress on equal pay for similar work with sri lanka places above rake said the worst offender on unequal pay is the financial sector where salaries and bonuses can remain widely disproportionate between the sexes but she also pointed to small companies without dedicated human resources facilities which are less likely to conduct pay audits the fawcett society has called on the government to include mandatory pay auditing in the equalities bill scheduled to be introduced in next months queens speech harriet harman the minister for women and equality has already announced a requirement for all public sector bodies to publish their gender pay gaps the figure for the treasury is though women in the government equalities office are paid more than men sri lankas position above britain in the global equality chart can also be explained in part by its high ranking on political empowerment the country is judged the fifth most equal in the world thanks to the long incumbencies as prime minister and president of sirimavo bandaranaike and chandrika kumaratunga the widow and daughter respectively of the assassinated prime minister swrd bandaranaike britains score dipped slightly on this index thanks to a fall in the number of women ministers yvonne galligan director of the centre for the advancement of women in politics at queens university in belfast said it was a matter of concern that there were still fewer than women in the house of commons its very interesting to look at the scottish parliament and the welsh assembly in both there is a much healthier gender balance and that has meant that issues come into the political arena that are perhaps seen as womens issues but are adopted collectively she cited the issue of violence against women which she said had been strongly taken up by the scottish parliament in general she said younger parliaments were often much more representative the rwandan parliament is the first where women outnumber men but dr selvi thriuchandran director of the womens education and research centre in the sri lankan capital of colombo said she was puzzled by the wef findings pointing out that aside from the bandaranaikes sri lanka had the worst record in south asia in terms of womens representation in the legislature and executive in fact the parliament has blocked a bill originated by womens groups asking for a quota of for women also the parliament has blocked liberal reforms of abortion sri lanka is also in the middle of a civil war and there is much violence against women in society as well as rape and attacks on women in the conflict zone i cannot see how they can have reached this conclusion they must have looked at the wrong issues,2008-11,woman working full time paid less male counterpart lifetime wa claimed yesterday new government

what do women want in a man it is the eternal question and it has never been answered well this week i stumbled across the answer completely by mistake of course women of my grandmothers generation seem to settle for someone who can carry a heavy watering can who can take them for a run out in the car for a pasty and chips at a push someone who can iron their own shirts for my mothers generation more is required someone who will peel the potatoes once a week and as my father discovered this week someone whose idea of a great present is not a giftwrapped ironing board cover even if it is by cath kidston women of the postfeminist generation are more difficult to decipher according to peter jonason of new mexico university we want bad boys with a dark triad of traits narcissism thrills and deceitfulness not so after all does anyone still hanker after colin farrell colin firth is far more of a catch big ex thought he had found the answer when he presented me a bunch of yellow supermarket carnations id always wanted to be given flowers i dreamed of irises and peonies egyptian lilies the colour of rust porcelaincoloured roses not red roses the choice of the unimaginative man and certainly not carnations from somerfield another ex thought he had found the answer when he forced himself through a book of john donne poems he deserves brownie points for remembering my favourite poet of course and he said he rather enjoyed the flea but thats all he could say he didnt know what it was about and when i asked what he thought of a valediction forbidding mourning he asked if it was by the beatles after that i upped my game and decided id rather like a man with a decent iq best friend settled for a rendition of the incubus tune stellar being strummed to her on a guitar and for a while another friend was satisfied with a desperate housewives boxset from her boyfriend but this week a man dressed as mozart showed me what i really wanted he wasnt a date or a fling in fact i didnt even catch his real name big boss sent me to a carnival in a small town feeling shrewd i parked in a culdesac im not going to compete with other festivalgoers in the main car parks i thought my work was done by pm minutes before the carnival procession began but id left my craftily parked car in a blockedin road that was closed until midnight six police officers told me to set up camp i would be staying the night it took a performer dressed as mozart and his mate with a luminous yellow jacket posing an emergency worker to get me out my renault clio followed mozarts mate who moved hoards through a closed road with his yellow jacket and loud voice he even moved two metal barriers and a pair of police horses out of my path leading me out on to a direct road straight to the m my hero so what do women really want commitment is soso roses are overrated what we want is a man with a full head of hair a luminous jacket and a good pair of lungs we want someone who can shift crowds and move horses for a damsel in distress we want our very own superman,2008-11,woman want man eternal question ha never answered well week stumbled across answer completely mistake course woman

i like naughty boys i was married to david bailey who was one of the naughtiest i like real men and i like masculinity the first time i was aroused was when i met marlon brando i was nine or years old brandos best friend was very close to my father and i remember sitting on his lap he said hello cutie and i had a feeling id never had sitting on my fathers lap he was absolutely gorgeous and it made me aware of feelings i didnt know were there i had boyfriends early and i still like men but as ive got older ive come to know what i like and ive realised i like them very masculine im not a prettyboy kind of a girl the brad pitts dont do anything for me i like men that are bigger than me i like to be engulfed bailey isnt taller than me but he was bigger his size and his personality were overwhelming and i like feeling like that im and the great thing about being my age is that i feel i really know what i want do i believe in monogamy yes and no its a great thing that works for a great many people but i think there is a way of being with someone and allowing them to experiment i think its very rare but its achievable with a certain kind of person i dont want a longterm relationship i am selfish in that i want to live in my own place but i would like a connection sex wasnt something that id say i was particularly interested in when i was younger i just saw it as part of what happened in a relationship today its part of what i pursue i feel i have more power now which is obviously very intoxicating the problem with being a strong woman is that you can sometimes emasculate men men are intimidated by me i very rarely get asked out most of the men who do hit on me are younger and i dont want to go out with someone younger but unfortunately the last person men my age want to date is someone in her fifties they want beautiful or yearolds so its tricky theres lots of guys i fancy but i cant take it further because it would be a waste of time im spoilt as well ive lived a certain kind of life and i hate to say this but i couldnt go out with a dustman i wouldnt know what to talk about yes its arrogant but i have to go out with someone who has some knowledge of how ive lived im not saying they have to be a celebrity but they have to have had a level of excellence because im a high achiever i have gone out with a lot of famous people i dated the likes of eric clapton and warren beatty although i never screwed warren i dont like all this letsbefriends stuff the only person that ive ever had a sexual relationship with that im still involved with is bailey i know the only reason for that is that i married him very young and his family became my family mine became his and i know his children and his wife intimately i can be friends with men if i havent had a relationship with them but i dont like carrying it on once its over marco pierre white was a boyfriend well he was a lover and occasionally i see him and its fine but we dont hang out what on earth would we talk about we were lovers not friends its one or the other i genuinely have to work i dont have enough money not to but the last thing i would want is to be looked after it drives my dad mad hes now and he says to me you have worked all your fing life why not let someone look after you but im a feminist and id rather do anything than be with someone because they are looking after me marie helvin the autobiography is published in paperback by phoenix,2008-11,like naughty boy wa married david bailey wa one naughtiest like real men like masculinity first time wa

why do young people understand so little about the world of work friday sees a government initiative encouraging children to take over various workplaces around the country for a day organised by the childrens commissioners office the idea is that by allowing children to be mini decisionmakers for a day they will understand a little more about what goes on at work sounds fun sounds noisy but this is a serious purpose for years employers and their various organisations have complained that the graduates they hire are bright and able just not ready for work where do the roots of this problem lie are parents to blame for not telling their kids what they do all day i visited three primary schools in north staffordshire to find out i asked children of all ages from schools with very different catchments areas what their parents did they all knew often in startling detail fouryearold daniel from leek first school explained my mum works at home she looks after henry and baby brooke henry is his younger brother and mum is a childminder to the baby nineyearold matthew interprets his fathers solicitor job as my dad helps people to treat other people better his father is in fact the senior partner olivia six said her father worked in a fish and chip shop selling fish sausages chips and drinks she had no idea he owned the shop likewise sixyearold george said his dad was a plumber and my mum gives cups of coffee to people working in our house in fact his parents run their own heating repair business many children expressed great pride in their parents jobs racheljay from churnet view middle school beamed that her mum is a very very good dinner lady and a brilliant cook and when robert said my dad teaches canoeing climbing and cycling at a climbing centre his classmates cheered declaring this a great job at westwood first school several children i met had direct experience of work megan eight told me my dad works in a shop called antiques within delivering fixing and selling things i know this because sometimes i go to work with him eightyearold daniel said my dad works in a scrap merchants buying and selling scrap ive also been to his work daughter of a vicar anna eight had a clear idea of his role he has meetings with married couples and sometimes he works at home doing stuff for the church time and again it was their parents jobs in relation to other people that the children homed in on they liked being asked about it and they knew the details that to them mattered status and hierarchy were not just unimportant they simply didnt exist but fast forward another dozen years and employers complaints about the young graduates theyve recruited go beyond literacy and numeracy skills something more fundamental is missing says richard wainer the cbis head of education and skills policy we wouldnt say every graduate is unfit for work but generic skills are often lacking such as team building communication skills and problem solving its a view echoed by john mcgurk of the chartered institute of personnel and development though he grimaces at calling these soft skills tactical skills is a better term it comes from the armed forces where the idea that only officers should learn these skills is frowned upon because if the person in charge is killed someone has to take over if people skills are lacking among some graduates its not the parents who are to blame but the fault of employers themselves who place too much emphasis on the paper chase for qualifications so says occupational psychologist and careers adviser sherridan hughes everyone has to have the obligatory these days and many employers look for good alevel grades too little wonder that students get the idea that academic achievement is all that matters its gone too far were losing good young people as a result kids are killing themselves getting these pieces of paper workrelated learning is a statutory element at key stage four of the national curriculum and almost all to yearolds undertake work experience lasting one or two weeks but is that really sufficient often its just a token gesture where kids just make the tea or do the filing and very few really get valuable experience says hughes a view echoed by mcgurk work experience is often a tickbox exercise which doesnt involve proper engagement beyond showing someone the photocopier so children lose interest it has to be properly structured and many arent so theyre next to useless the uks system of one short work placement doesnt measure up well in international comparisons says tony watts visiting professor in career development at the university of derby in sweden school pupils used to complete three placements over a period of time and across three sectors manufacturing service and social services he says thats no longer the case but it had the merit of giving all young people experience in a variety of work generally speaking tracking work in school is stronger in most scandinavian and european systems than here it could be because we have a different culture that encourages education to be less vocational than in europe half of all the graduate vacancies advertised in the uk are for graduates in any subject quite a striking statistic a spokesman at the department for children schools and families says the new curriculum which started this september has more enterprise and business skills content the new curriculum is designed to be less prescriptive and more flexible so teachers can encourage children to use the kind of skills employers have said are missing says the spokesman who explains that changes to the curriculum and the new diploma qualification include more workbased training too schools dont exist as entities in themselves we recognise the skills gap and are doing something about it children need skills that can be used in the workplace and the diploma is designed to provide handson training as a stepping stone into work employers have some work to do too says john arnold chartered occupational psychologist at loughborough university business school its all very well employers saying graduates dont understand the workplace but how would any of them fare in a student culture he asks older and more established workers have their own motives to notice what younger people cant do they may feel threatened by them for more information visit

i cant catch a break every time i come close to keeping up with the trends things change on me i buy a new laptop and everyone gets a mac i pour myself into stilettos and flats suddenly come into style i purchase my first dvd and then must turn around and plead what the hell is bluray now just as ive finally started to get my bearings in this dating game it only took me a decade and a half it seems that dating is out hooking up is the new black when did this happen its just not fair as charles blow recently pointed out in his oped column in the new york times courting trends have shifted somewhat the young people of today and im talking really young like high school and collegeaged kids not fake clingingtothewhispersofyouthyoung like me do not engage in the romantic practices of their predecessors gone are the days of a nervous young woman waiting to be pursued by a fellow perhaps agreeing to accompany him to a spring formal and then maybe just maybe allowing herself to be adorned with his varsity jacket which she would naturally wear proudly on the sidelines at the big game perhaps after many many months of dating they might even move things to a more physical level let the record show nothing like this ever happened to me in high school or maybe if thats a little too pleasantville for you there was this scenario boy meets girl girl and boy share mutual attraction boy asks girl on a date girl agrees they date for a while breakup get back together breakup get back together engage in some sort of sexual activity and then breakup again this time for real is that more familiar grandma and grandpa still not talking about myself here instead it seems young people today have a different pattern in place they hang out in large groups no real partnerships or alliances forged until a hook up happens a hook up my fellow dinosaurs occurs when two friendly acquaintances decide to have a casual sexual experience together but without any expectation of a relationship to follow as blow so eloquently states think of it as a onenight stand with someone you know and lest you think im using this to open yet another forum for teenagerbashing understand this young adults are not engaging in any more sexual activity than previous generations according to both blow and the centers for disease control theyre actually not as active as kids were back in my day hooking up is not synonymous with promiscuity according to a study from the guttmacher institute teenagers are waiting longer to have sex than they did in the past and over of them are using contraception this is better than the adult rate of contraception use by the way they arent having more sex or unsafe sex theyre simply switching up the order of operations on us and adding some lingo to the relationship vernacular theyre sly those young people i was pretty entertained throughout most of blows column until the very end when i found these lines it used to be that you were trained your whole life to date said kathleen bogle a professor at la salle university in philadelphia now weve lost that ability the ability to just ask someone out and get to know them now thats sad so basically kids now are hanging out getting to know each other in a platonic situation maybe hooking up to see if they want to take things to the next level and were upset about this thats bad because im kind of thinking that sounds almost exactly like the kind of dating ive always done except i play more games and tend to spill a lot in public also who was trained her whole life to date were not at a dog show that sounds like either some sort of soulless procreation robot or a tres tragique victorian heroine whos just about to load her pockets with rocks and wander into the river if you ask me if the teen pregnancy rate is at an alltime low people are waiting longer to have their first sexual experience and theyre not being idiots about condoms and birth control how is this new model not an improvement obviously the ideal situation would be that young adults wouldnt engage in any sexual activity until theyre completely ready for it but the same can be wished for a lot of older adults too and whos to say that spending time with a person on a platonic level and then maybe having a more intimate trial relationship isnt a good idea and to be honest it still doesnt resonate any differently to me than previous ideas of dating the only difference is the absence of the stiff formality of first second third and subsequent dates those nascent few awkward hours spent together forcing conversation and discussing goals as though youre in the worlds longest most dimly lit job interview are enough to make me say kudos young people for managing to spare yourselves of that fellow

david cameron today pledged that a conservative government would fund additional rape crisis centres to tackle violence against women the conservative leader promised to spend m to increase the current network of crisis centres by a third as part of wideranging plans to conquer domestic violence rape forced marriage and trafficking the tory leader sought to highlight his partys determination to stamp out violence against women as jacqui smith the home secretary said she was set to launch a consultation to find out what the governmment could do to improve the safety of women in their homes at work and in public the political commitments from both parties to beef up measures to root out violence against women came as crimestoppers launched an appeal for people to give information about the domestic abuse of a family member friend colleague or neighbour over the christmas period a spokeswoman said changes in the domestic violence crime and victims act now allowed crimestoppers to play a more active part in asking for information there was no risk to the anonymity of the caller and their information could be vital in getting offenders prosecuted crimestoppers spokeswoman hannah daws said christmas is a time when many people socialise and invariably their alcohol consumption increases a large proportion of domestic violence cases involve alcohol so it is important that people are aware that this devastating crime continues throughout the festive season cameron used an interview with the radio s womans hour to promise that a tory government would implement a crossdepartmental strategy on tackling violence against women and ensure that all police recruits receive appropriate training on issues such as domestic violence stalking female genital mutilation rape honourbased violence and forced marriage three million women in britain experience violence each year according to the tories domestic violence accounts for of all violent crime and over of its victims are women the tory leader said he would end the process of shortterm annual funding decisions by introducing stable threeyear funding cycles for rape crisis centres the proposals outlined in a document entitled ending violence against women also include provisions for the teaching of sexual consent compulsory in the sex education curriculum and clear guidance to teachers about specific forms of violence against women women housed in refuges following domestic violence would also be allowed a threemonth grace period during which they would not have to seek work in order to qualify for jobseekers allowance cameron explained the tory leader said his party and the government had much common ground on the issue of domestic violence he said we should work together on this very important issue which is trying to end the violence that takes place against women in our society million women every year suffer some sort of violent attack i think the difference is that weve produced this document today which is a crossdepartmental strategy and the government havent yet done that the tory leader said there were many different forms of violence against women and they required different answers smith said she was set to launch a consultation to find out what ministers could do to improve the safety of women in their homes at work and in public she said domestic violence was a devastating hidden crime and the government was determined to tackle it in all its forms successful prosecutions against perpertrators have risen from to in the last five years as a result of improvements in the criminal justice system said smith we now have specialist domestic violence courts and we have committed over m to support the expansion of independent domestic violence advisers and multiagency risk assessment conferences across the country the government was increasing its efforts over the christmas period through a domestic violence enforcement campaign in police forces she added smith said but we know there is still more to be done particularly in the area of prevention by better identifying potential victimsi want people to recognise that we all have a role

geeks and feminists have much in common if feminism is about embracing and striving for some kind of utopian dream of human equality then democratising knowledge is an important part of this process increasingly new technologies and information and communication technologies in particular have huge potential to democratise access to creation of and distribution of knowledge theres an important distinction here between information and knowledge knowledge involves some kind of engagement with processing of and ownership of information participatory video for example is changing the way people do research allowing researchers and activists to work with rural communities in new and innovative ways enabling these communities to shape the ways in which they are represented and understood not only can communities more actively connect with and influence the research process they can also more readily access key research findings without having to wade through mountains of heavy academic text for academics and activists involved in policy processes this entirely changes the field and brings new voices including those of poorer women into the debate digital storytelling is another specific methodology being used not just to extract information from people or to build evidence for arguments but to also allow people to tell their own story on their terms participants come up with a threeminute audio narrative which they illustrate with chosen imagery for anyone who has had experience of this process there is no denying the transformative power of opening up spaces for peoples voices to be heard and taken seriously then theres the added bonus of creating something beautiful from the process i was recently at a feminist technology exchange ftx run as part of and in the lead up to the association of womens rights in development ftx was developed in response to calls from feminist and womens rights movements for greater understanding of emerging technologies their potential and impact on the rights and lives of women what ftx emphasised was the importance for feminists of accessing and creating information in the context of very specific activist struggles the ramifications of this are clear for example the project that gives survivors of domestic violence untraceable donated cell phones to ensure secure communication when they are seeking help or the project that uses mobile phones to update people about what hivaids treatment should be available to them in their area these new technologies films mobile phones the internet are particularly useful when working with previously marginalised groups because they offer an instant global platform and when working with vulnerable groups because they offer speed of information transfer and anonymity much of the expression of lesbian and gay identity particularly in the africa the middle east and asia for example happens online where people are relatively protected by the anonymity afforded by the internet however there are other arenas of struggle which although perhaps more subtle are arguably as important how for example do images of different women in different contexts shape the way we view the world in terms of what we imagine exists and in terms of what we imagine can exist one example is a film made by colleagues in bangladesh which shows women doing jobs traditionally regarded as mens work many people have responded with a mixture of surprise and awe often it has never occurred to them that it would be possible for women to occupy such roles a strong argument for encouraging a more democratic use of media technologies is that it will enable us to change the way in which women are popularly represented in particular in the global south we need more images of women that challenge popular orthodoxies and narratives images of for example barefoot pregnant african women reinforce unnuanced negative stereotypes of woman as victims by ensuring women have access to these technologies we can populate the media with grassroots knowledge and cultural artefacts from new perspectives whats interesting about the use of information and communication technologies is not just the creation of these new artefacts and the ways they are influencing change but the process of their creation and the potential for the traditionally structurally disempowered to be in control of and understand the creation tools all this is good news for the left and for those interested in cultural politics george lakoff an american sociolinguist influential in contemporary debates about revitalising progressive politics argues that we need to carefully reframe the way in which we articulate social policy issues in order to effectively communicate a more democratic approach to knowledge creation and distribution should allow us to be a lot more aware of the way in which we speak about issues and the metaphors we invoke in so doing artful use of information and communication strategies can reengage the popular imagination empower the disenfranchised and reclaim political discourse tessa lewin is the communication and learning officer for the pathways of

you dont have to be poor to experience domestic violence plenty of middleclass women and some men are beaten and humiliated by their partners but theres growing evidence that the global recession is making people more vulnerable to physical and mental abuse this isnt because poverty causes violence in itself but it does create conditions a sudden change in circumstances acute financial problems loss of selfesteem in which its likely to take place in an interview in the guardian today attorney general baroness scotland says she believes domestic violence will become more widespread as the recession deepens which supports reports from the us where the effects of the subprime crisis began to be felt a while ago putting families under huge levels of stress a recent report from florida suggests that domestic violence refuges in tampa bay are struggling to cope with an increase in the numbers of women seeking a safe place to stay one refuge took in women in october this year twice as many as the same period last year obviously there is no excuse for domestic violence and many men who suffer a sudden drop in income or lose their jobs dont take it out on their partners and children but preexisting abuse is likely to get worse if a man is angry depressed and spending more time at home because he no longer has a job men who feel insecure often abuse their partners and children to make themselves feel less inadequate as a recent editorial in the british medical journal acknowledged violence is used frequently to resolve a crisis of male identity it observed it also pointed out that poverty increases vulnerability by raising the degree of conflict in relationships diminishing womens economic power and reducing mens ability to lead what they think of as successful lives amnesty international which has run a highprofile campaign against domestic violence around the world sees poverty and marginalisation as both causes and consequences of violence against women poor women in developing countries find it harder to escape abusive situations get protection from violent partners or redress from the criminal justice system this is particularly true when women are illiterate and live in countries where patriarchal attitudes persist among lawyers and judges in the developed world decades of campaigning by organisations such as refuge mean that the existence of domestic violence is widely acknowledged but the impact of the recession on already fraught relationships is only just being recognised as unemployment and job insecurity affects more families its depressing but not surprising that women are becoming scapegoats for their partners feelings of anger and humiliation job losses are being reported daily and men who have lost their own incomes may resent the fact that their partners are still working even if theyre in minimum wage jobs or they may drink to blot out their misery exacerbating financial problems and making violence more likely as economic forecasts for the next year get worse the government needs to alert gps teachers and social workers to look for signs of abuse in those families hit hardest by the recession,2008-12,dont poor

the first time i went into a feminist bookshop i was completely overwhelmed it wasnt just the sheer number of womanfriendly books and magazines though that in itself was amazing it was the sense of community the reading groups the board where local organisations posted their events the activism the friendships formed feminist bookshops are a lot more than stacks of steinem or hooks theyre often the centerpieces of local feminist organising but like many independent bookshops feminist outlets are in trouble deep trouble last year book woman the only feminist bookstore in texas almost had to shut its doors because of a lack of funds this year its in other words in portland oregon the bookshop recently put out a call on their website on blogs and via email asking people to help them raise in order to keep their doors open we know it sounds crazy that a small bookstore in portland could raise this much money in such a short time however our community of locals outoftown family and friends as well as feminists nationwide have responded in full force to our plea they are making online donations swarming through our doors to support the store by doing their shopping and attending events and by getting the word out to their own communities that we need help and its working weve made nearly in the five days since we announced our financial crisis clearly in other words is an institution that our community will not let go under the organising around in other words has indeed been amazing feminist blogs have posted about the bookstores situation and ive received dozens of emails from activists asking for donations for the store we can keep this store this community open after all we did it with book woman in just a few months the store raised nearly and was able to stay open because again this is about more than just books in an interview with feministing heather ites one of the proprieters of the oldest feminist bookstore in north america the amazon bookstore cooperative said literature has been historically seen as a liberating space a transgressive space and having that filtered through a corporate entity like large bookstores or online megagiants is scary scary indeed to me and to me so the next time youre thinking of buying a feminist book instead of heading to the nearest shopping centre consider heading to your local feminist joint as ites noted without free spaces free thinking spaces this world is in dire trouble and with more and more independent booksellers going out of business it is more important than ever to be conscious of what you are actually supporting besides youll probably find a lot more there than a book youll find a community,2008-12,first time went feminist bookshop wa completely overwhelmed wasnt sheer number

one in four parents have reduced their working life to spend more time with their family according to a government study that also charts the rise of relay parenting whereby mums and dads parent in shifts to fit around their jobs families are under stress from the pressures of juggling work and home life but even so parents who work are more likely to stay together because financial problems are one of the biggest strains a relationship can suffer says the wideranging cabinet office study which documents the changing nature of families it was presented at a conference of newspaper and tv agony aunts convened by the childrens secretary ed balls to highlight the impact of family breakdown on children the paper declares the end of the typical family we see an increasing range of family structures to the extent that there is arguably no longer a onesizefitsall family in britain today but this is diversity and not decline warm loving and stable relationships matter more for our happiness and wellbeing than the legal form of a relationship says the introduction written by the minister for families beverley hughes and the cabinet office minister liam byrne it documents the growing impact of working lives on families around of adults aged to have downshifted their careers over the last years by quitting their jobs reducing their hours or changing their career path a third said spending more time with their family was the primary reason nearly were looking for a more fulfilling job and about said they were looking for a postmaterialist lifestyle while mothers and fathers now spend more quality time with their children in particular taking part in educational activities there is much less couple time for parents children see less of their parents as a couple and the reduction in shared time places conflicts and strains on their relationships says the paper titled families in britain unemployment and economic shocks in a family are a trigger for breakups it warns the report attempts to debunk the myth that the traditional family pattern of two married parents has declined since the s pointing out that rates of lone parents were the same in the th century as they are today it outlines the numerous negative effects on children when their parents separate but suggests that if parents can keep an amicable relationship and maintain as much stability as possible they can ameliorate those damaging effects families that experience breakdown face the most challenges but a negative impact on their children is not inevitable maternal grandparents play a crucial role when parents separate stepping in to support the parents in particular the level of involvement of grandparents is often a factor in whether a mother living alone with her children can take a job four in grandparents live within minutes of their grandchild and see them several times a week some of grandparents feel very close to their grandchild ed balls said we know that in the vast majority of cases where parents are splitting up they will always try to make sure they put the needs of children first but sometimes that just isnt possible and the risk is that the impact of their parents breakup can sometimes scar children for life balls announced m in funding for the relationship counselling service relate to support families and said he would fund a new booklet to be called kids in the middle written by agony aunts including linda blair of the guardian and deidre sanders of the sun to go into schools and doctors surgeries a child health strategy due to be published in the new year will include an expansion of the role for health visitors and other professionals in the first weeks of a babys life when stress levels are running high and research shows the family is most at risk of breakup he said the paper finds that most parents now aspire to share the workload of child rearing but in general fail to achieve the ideal the new research confirms that women still shoulder the bulk of the housework i dont see her when i work sarah a lawyer in central london and james a filmmaker have a twoyearold daughter milly when james is unemployed its great he looks after her and i can work as much as i need to but then if he isnt working theres huge financial pressure and when i work that hard i dont really see her and thats not great childcare doesnt solve the problem of missing your child when james is working its really tough its just me i need help in the mornings and evenings dropping her off and picking her up but the minimum someone works for is hours a week that costs a month on top of of nursery costs but we have to pay that otherwise theres no way i can make it to work on time its still this hard even though i downshifted to four days im now at a small familyfriendly firm earning about a third of what i earned as a city lawyer in my old job it was normal not to get home until pm but being a lawyer is never a ninetofive job and i still work weekends my job will never be predictable i sometimes think i downshifted in income but not in terms of the demands on me some nights im so exhausted i can hardly see people say working from home is the answer but i think theres a lot of dishonesty in the discussion about what people are capable of doing if you are up four times in the night go to work come home get the kid to bed and then are expected to work more what kind of brutal society is that do we think that will solve the gender equality issue im good at my job and i believe in what im doing but sometimes i feel the only answer is to abandon the career names have been changed,2008-12,one four parent reduced working life spend time family according government study also chart rise relay

the womens issue review december made fascinating reading i suspect a matriarchy would be no less ruthless and defensive of its power than a patriarchy this is not to suggest that a matriarchy should not be given a crack at the whip but surely the fact that women are no less power hungry and competitive than men and why should they be explains mens overwhelming fear of letting go of control of the reins women most certainly have developed relational and support skills which many men appear to lack but i fear such skills are borne of centuries of need rather than innate altruism however thats not to say its not high time we had a chance and with women like sarah brown at the helm theres every possibility that i could ultimately be labelled an old cynic her qampa was warm and intelligent inspiring and hopefilling and with yon beret on she shows that she can look every bit as glamorous as mrs sarkozy if she chooses to joyce gunn cairns edinburgh as a teacher and education researcher i have witnessed instances of sexual harassment by and from children among themselves as a commonplace activity and communication i have read depressing testimonies of boys in schools threatening girls with rape if they do not comply with an atmosphere of sexual harassment these instances are symptomatic of a very serious threatening and wide problem in schools sexism is now acceptable women are targets and playthings for whatever society wishes to do to them the media must take a great deal of the responsibility for this state of affairs helen lees coventry the womens issue was an intelligent and thorough look at changing circumstances and womens viewpoints in todays society it would be great to have a similar counterpoint focused on men examining such issues as the rise of body dysmorphia and anorexia among young men the disparity between paternity and maternity leave the issue of male rape men as the victims of domestic violence suicide being the highest cause of death of men in their twenties and so on all these issues are facing men today but seem to be largely ignored by the mainstream media james brown nottingham just a touch ironic that the special womens issue of the review crowded out the regular gem from the year archive of your distinguished photographer jane bown peter barnes milton keynes rachel cooke refers to the fact that bbc economics editor stephanie flanders was missing from our screens during the biggest financial story in years because she was on maternity leave doesnt this sum up the equality issue she missed the story she wasnt there so people had to cover for her would anyone be surprised if her status and authority were to suffer because she was unable to do her job albeit for understandable reasons and whose fault is it that there are no female economists to fill the gap bbc and have female controllers the bbc is accused of dumbing down with too many soaps and shows about cookery or home makeovers or shoppingfashion

who is best placed to bring up your child you or the possibly transient probably underpaid young and not as naturally qualified staff of a daycare centre this is the question raised by last weeks report from unicef on the state of childcare in developed countries for the first time in centuries it notes the majority of parents in the developed world are farming out the care of their children to paid workers at the same time neuroscientific research shows surprise surprise that the architecture of the brain is formed largely through the interactions of the early years love it turns out is as important for intellectual as for emotional development so this mothering thing that my generation was taught to disdain as something we could fit in round our economically valuable highstatus real work and that we could get away with paying other people low wages to do proves to be not such a side issue after all women have always known this secretly of course since childcare has been our historic responsibility weve felt in dereliction of our duty when we were on maternity leave or doing more of the childcare because that was how the architecture of our own brains had been established we could see how much social capital was created by meeting other parents hanging around at school gates this awkward truth remains the great unspoken issue of the childcare debate feminists dont particularly want to face it publicly because it plays into the hands of reactionaries whod rather we werent in the workplace and certainly not competing for the top jobs unfortunately theres another unpalatable reality in conflict with that one being with children all the time can be boring draining and frustrating most women work not only because they couldnt otherwise manage financially but also because work offers selfesteem sociability power and dignity the trouble with paid childcare is that it lets men off the hook women have to pay for childcare because most men arent prepared to cut back their hours to do enough of the parenting if women want to work it should be men rather than children who alter their lives it comes as no real surprise then that the countries doing best in unicefs assessment are those with the most social and gender equality sweden and iceland in the uk the debate about whether to opt for paid childcare in what form and how much of it takes place against a background of growing inequality a winnertakesall society where not to be constantly available on your blackberry is not to have a proper career the rewards for work of often opaque value certainly compared to raising a child can be enormous extended parental leave job security and parttime employment are for wimps many women look at the pay gap at their own inclination to balance at the impossibility of two parents being distracted most of the time and choose to work parttime or at any rate with less zealotry and most parents manage to cobble something together that more or less works the unicef report is flawed in not taking into account informal homebased or neighbourhood childcare grandparents child minders au pairs parents may feel guilty about how much of their childrens upbringing they delegate to others but the dangerous experiment that unicef implies we are embarked upon is actually being pursued for the most part with love and concern for the balance of everyones interests which is not to say that the circumstances in which the decisions are being made are remotely ideal it is those who arent in a position to make decisions with whom we should really be concerned one reason britain figured so poorly on unicefs rankings the government disputes our midtable position is that there are still three million children living in poverty here many are clustered in places where the notion of family itself seems to have collapsed here it is not a choice of whether both parents have serious jobs because theres only one parent and no work these families feature a desire to do the best by children as do families everywhere but have little ballast in terms of work or structure to lives a child from the most disadvantaged per cent of families is times more likely to have multiple problems at the age of than a child from the most affluent per cent of families nursery care can be invaluable here the unicef report which does rather lack the courage of its alarmist convictions acknowledges that daycare can improve linguistic and social development and help break the cycle of deprivation if you wanted to design an ideal childcare strategy you wouldnt start from here youd have to go much further back to gender parity and social equality and an economy that was designed to serve those ideals not ride roughshod over them perhaps the recession will induce a rethink perhaps technology will offer more civilised financially manageable ways of working to more people but its hard to see the balance of work and family being much easier

one of the first things i was told when i started at my secondary school in manchester was that years before it had been attended by two sisters christabel and sylvia pankhurst their mother emmeline had been the leader of the british suffragette movement and arguably the godmother of the battle for womens rights so it was drilled into us from an early age that much of what we had as girls and the opportunities we would be granted as women our schooling career opportunities the vote access to contraception and more had been fought for we were not to take anything for granted yet inevitably as we grew up through the s and then s that is exactly what we began to do after all to us the notion that girls should be treated any differently to boys in terms of education or that women should not have equality in the workplace or be barred from the political process seemed absurd we had never watched these issues being fought over we were born into a world where many had already been won and with so many battles behind us it is little surprise that the rate of change appears to have slowed down in my lifetime i am the womens rights movement seems to have moved forward in steps rather than the leaps of the past but i never thought it would move backwards yet is the year that the pay gap between men and women widened reversing for the first time in years and that the number of women attaining top jobs in britain fell it is also the year in which chief executive of the equalities and human rights commission nicola brewer told women that in some cases the glass ceiling had been replaced with one made of reinforced concrete todays ipsos mori poll published in the observer provides yet more worrying reading that of people agree with the statement that the mans job is to be the breadwinner and the womans is to look after the home is depressing that the figure rises to among to year olds many of whom were probably raised by mothers who worked is appalling of course this is one survey and it must be read with caution but its findings are disheartening women remain underrepresented in ftse boardrooms throughout politics in the judiciary the police and senior roles in the media and where they do succeed they are still likely to be paid less my generation may not have witnessed the major battles of the past but the fact that they were won means that we now have more choices about how to live our lives than our grandmothers could have ever dreamt of in it is worth remembering that we should not take what we have for granted and that there is still a fight to be

her husband was suffering from longterm depression and alcoholism hed lost his job four years ago and hadnt worked since her daughter who was had never worked the mother had done occasional cleaning work but hadnt had a proper job for years another benefitdependent household in an old industrial area where too many families need state support not britain though in gelsenkirchen in germany but things are changing for that family the mother and her daughter work and her husband receives specialist help and is ready to start seeking work its part of a radical approach run by a british company ae paying dividends in germany which we want to bring to britain britain is a country of glass ceilings once there was a welltrodden path from our most deprived areas to a better life from the shipyards of the clyde to the boardroom from the council estates of yorkshire to the corridors of power not today few escape our most deprived estates few young people with potential escape difficult upbringings fewer cross the social divides it was never easy but it should be much easier after a decade that we were promised would make the difference billions more spent on education and training billions on helping poorer families with tax credits millions of jobs created yet britain remains one of the least socially mobile countries in the developed world on our toughest estates generations

open to us or more choice about starting a family and the worst thing as a society were more imageconscious than ever and this obsession with how women look is so much a part of todays media that creates really hard pressures not just for people in the public eye but especially for girls at school and young women and we all need to learn how to deal with that so it doesnt overwhelm our lives a

in war when a commander orders the bombing of a strategic target all too often civilians collateral damage bear the brunt sometimes this is by design sometimes not for the more ruthless it is part of a zerosum strategy to humiliate terrorise and disempower the enemy rape as a weapon is just such a terror tactic one that views damaged and traumatised women as merely collateral damage while forcing large numbers of civilians to flee a territory in panic the coordinated mass rape of women is increasingly a weapon of choice not least in the democratic republic of congo as the film released by the guardian today demonstrates little or no action is currently being taken to stop this of course rape is forbidden under international law the customary laws of war forbid attacks on civilians including the rape of women rape is a war crime under the geneva conventions and several other legal codes the rome statute which established the international criminal court provides an extensive definition of rape as a war crime and the tribunals for the former yugoslavia and rwanda have prosecuted rape as a war crime indeed systematic use of rape can also be a crime against humanity and a constitutive element of genocide however the problem is that the laws are hardly adhered to at all to return to just one example among many in the congo a yearold woman called bitondo nyumba a mother of four from katungulu in south kivu province was beaten and raped in her own home by seven government army soldiers in her injuries were so severe that despite two operations she later died although this was not an unusual case the difference was that her family launched a campaign to bring the perpetrators to justice against the odds they were successful three men were pronounced guilty by a military tribunal in uvira in september this year but it was a hollow victory they remained untouched continuing to serve in their regiment meanwhile congo was about to plunge into a new bout of anarchy creating yet more cases like bitondo nyumbas what is the international community to do in the face of this horrific reality robust peacekeeping and serious engagement from major powers not least the african union is obviously key but so too is dealing with the aftermath of mass rape in june the un security council agreed resolution establishing not only that the use of rape as a systematic weapon of war is a war crime but that failure to prosecute and provide redress prolongs deepens and reignites conflict possibly a statement of the obvious its nevertheless an important recognition of the damaging genderviolence spiral that a conflict can create and it couldnt be more relevant to congo congos decade of violence derives from a horrible multiplicity of causal factors the tailend of genocide and ethnic hatred greed for minerals and land congolese political implosion and foreign intervention and one spark to the flame has been the overwhelming sense that killers and rapists were going to get away with it noone was going to bring them to justice ever as in so many conflicts women and children have borne the brunt of suffering in congo amnesty recently published a report showing that for every two child soldiers rescued from the north kivu conflict five more are abducted and forced to serve as soldiers and rape is used to a terrifying extent at the end of the un records that rape cases were being reported every month in north kivu province alone how is this impacting on communities first husbands of female rape victims often seem to find it harder to cope with the rape than the women themselves rejection and ostracism is common women just have to pick up the pieces and rebuild their and their childrens lives and often also rebuild their own communities meanwhile un efforts to deal with the aftermath of conflict and mass rape are still in development for example un security council resolution passed at the turn of this century after much lobbying by womens rights activists around the world requires all peace and reconstruction processes to put gender at their heart in liberia for example attempts have been made to make resolution projects work but in practice theyve often foundered the un has offered disarmament and rehabilitation programmes to excombatants of whom had been women in liberias wars of the s and s but as they were designed with men in mind the women often couldnt benefit locations and hours of courses made them inaccessible for many women and no childcare support was offered indeed many women wouldnt even present to the programmes as this meant identifying themselves as rape survivors and excombatants and exposing themselves to shame stigma and hostility the un has hopefully learnt from where it went wrong in liberia what we need are projects women set up themselves designed around the realities of womens needs these have proven relatively sustainable in liberia producing tangible economic benefits to the whole community perhaps when people do get round the table to rebuild conflictravaged african countries the un will give better force to its own resolutions and have women at the discussion with their own solutions for a truly lasting peace and economic redevelopment meanwhile how long before the women of congo are able to do this,2008-12,war commander order bombing strategic target often civilian

it isnt always very cool to be a feminist these days youd have thought you would get away with it at university though especially at a place like the london school of economics my idea of female emancipation does not include beauty pageants however i am told by some of my fellow students who support the miss lse competition part of miss university london that parading up and down on a stage being judged on how we conform to a standard of beauty is all in the name of womens lib emancipated objectified more like i am flabbergasted that students at topclass institutions can honestly think that what they are doing is postfeminist i dont buy their postfeminism malarkey and i definitely wont be told that following the mantra of dumb down breasts out makes me the modern woman you just have to look at the ratio of men to women in parliament and the media to see that the fight for gender equality is nowhere close to being won its a massive con by selling this as empowerment for women discrimination can continue and thats why we need to protest because it is all part of the bigger picture the wider struggle no of course they are not as damaging as trafficking or as controversial as prostitution but if we accept beauty pageants without debate where do we draw the line i realised i had hit a huge nerve with the promiss lse camp when i was confronted one day in an aggressive manner by a few of the organisers apparently i was making the women taking part feel bad and should cancel the protest i was planning they claimed that there was a diverse range of women competing of all shapes and sizes and backgrounds a quick glance at photos of the contestants shows that this was a transparent lie no room for trans gay or disabled contestants clearly in hindsight our protest was a huge success it was bigger and louder than last years demo i cant say i missed being called a fat hairy lesbian by the punters as happened last year and our healthy gender balance proved that we werent just enjoying an excuse to play the manhater card proclaiming that you are only there to support a friend who was taking part is no argument shame on a personal level i had to protest to distance myself from the event and to show that these lse students did not speak for me or represent the ethos of the school id like to see the lse say more than that they wont comment on what students do in their free time i believe its a gross misappropriation of the schools name and we should distance ourselves from it as much as possible the organisers propose a mr lse competition as a solution but regardless of gender we are humans not objects,2008-12,isnt always cool feminist day youd thought would get away university though especially place like london school economics idea

unmarried fathers have reasons to celebrate the welfare reform bill announced in the queens speech proposes new requirements for the birth registration of children each year children are registered with only one parents name on the birth certificate a father who is not named does not have parental responsibility in law and so in theory has no say in a childs upbringing and all the issues that matter such as education and medical treatment in june a white paper recording responsibility explained how joint birth registration would become a legal requirement for all unmarried parents unless the registrar thought it to be impossible impracticable or unreasonable the white paper said mothers would also have a right to insist that the father acknowledges his responsibilities to his child and that the father has a new right to insist that he is registered why does it matter the change has been prompted by the fragile families study in the us carried out to provide information about unmarried parents and their children over several years children three quarters of whom were born to unmarried parents in cities have been followed to look at what keeps a couple together and what tears them apart the study looked in detail at issues such as the capabilities potential and realised of fathers in particular how the children fare and what policies help or hinder in the process the fragile families has usefully helped to bin a number of stereotypes including that of the disengaged deadbeat dad given a chance often signalled by joint birth registration men do try to do the right thing the study found most fathers appear to be very involved and to be committed to helping raise the child even among unmarried fathers and even among fathers who are not residing with the mothers in the uk as the white paper pointed out drawing on the fragile families findings a fathers positive involvement in a childs life can lead to good educational achievement and reduce the risk of mental health issues for children in separated families it can also help to boost a childs resilience and wellbeing some critics oppose the idea of joint registration saying it might put some mothers and children at risk of an abusive dad asserting his rights to the detriment of all the fragile families study indicated that unmarried mothers sometimes do struggle between wanting a fathers involvement with their child and the need to protect the child from violence andor substance misuse the study said mothers distinguish between healthy and unhealthy relationships particularly in cases of domestic violence choosing to end their romantic relationships and limit fathers access to the children the study also recommended that different options should be found to incarceration because the impact on children of sending fathers to prison was especially hard more support should also be given to helping families to stay together while trying to tackle issues such as both parents addiction while changes are underway fatherhood is still treated too often as an undertaking on the margins of family life two weeks paternity leave on a pittance underlines that point more engagement of fathers in pregnancy a friend whose wife is expecting a baby imminently says hes constantly made to feel an irritant by the midwives and his view isnt untypical an assumption on the part of gps teachers and nursery staff that father and mother are jointly involved in rearing a child would make a big difference and especially so for young men who want to do their best and yet are treated as if they can

the worlds attention always hungry for the pornography of disaster is moving on from the insurgency in the democratic republic of the congo cholera in zimbabwe is this weeks crisis next week it will be another country another tragedy yet in congo as we report today the troubles were claiming victims long before the worlds attention first swooped in september and will go on claiming victims far into the future since biblical times rape has been the final humiliation for defeated populations terrorising families and keeping fearful women from working in the fields or going into the forests to gather wood commonly victims of rape suffer further abuse they are excluded from their community robbed not only of selfworth and often their children but even of the means to feed themselves meanwhile the perpetrators are rarely caught and if they are brought to trial have fled long before they are convicted at best they will receive a derisory prison sentence over the past six months leah chishugi a survivor of the rwanda massacre and now a nurse in the uk has courageously recorded the stories of hundreds of congolese rape victims in kivu province her film is on our website the act of witness is an important start to be taken seriously and treated as an individual is the beginning of the process of restoring some sense of selfworth working to stop these rapes happening in the future is the next step on monday at a specially convened session the un human rights council expressly condemned sexual violence in kivu it called on the government in kinshasa to act but there was no parallel commitment to end the culture of impunity among the militia commanders they must realise that they cannot rape or allow their men to rape free from the fear of consequences that means bolstering the court system and supporting women to bring charges it also means vetting the security services so that rapists and suspected rapists are excluded it means putting womens rights at the heart of peacekeeping and reconstruction and supporting the efforts of local and international charities to provide medical and psychological care for victims but it is also important to begin to understand the pathology of sexual violence in warzones rape can be a weapon of control for the young soldiers who make up the militias often little more than children themselves brutalised by their commanders and seeking however fleetingly to control their environment that means providing schooling and skills for them and for the children born from rape otherwise they will become the next generation of soldiers and the next generation of rapists,2008-12,world attention always hungry pornography disaster moving insurgency democratic republic congo cholera zimbabwe week crisis next week
