if you are a female and b fed up with workplace politics you are not alone in fact youre a growing breed according to a new study which says that women increasingly believe their male colleagues play often immoral power games while they on the other hand are adamant that theyd never resort to such tactics to win promotion women see progress in the modern office as being based on political skill rather than competence they realise that to get on you have to stitch people up stab colleagues in the back and try to appear better than other people all things that they believe men enjoy but which they dont says the studys author kate mackenzie davey of birkbeck college university of london who interviewed women across the country come on girls if politicking really is the only way forward why dont you throw caution to the wind and embrace that good oldfashioned if you cant beat em join em attitude not a chance lament the majority of the women surveyed many of whom justify their decision on the basis of these games being corrupt and unkind people like my boss seem to get their satisfaction out of getting one up on someone else out of winning the power games and i see that as a very masculine attitude to work which i completely reject says one but she adds it probably means ill never get very far nicola stuart a pa from stratford in east london agrees if you want to make it in this office you have to be quick to point the finger when something goes wrong be in with the right cliques and grab as much turf as you can from day one ive refused to lower myself to it other recent studies also show women denying any interest in underhand careerenhancing tactics a recent survey by recruitment agency planet recruit found that twice as many men as women say they are happy to take credit for someone elses work meanwhile of the men questioned said they would be prepared to have sex with their boss if it would get them a higher status job while less than a third of the women said they would do so but says dr mackenzie davey a deep dislike for mercenary strategies isnt the only reason women claim not to get involved in office politics many feel they would fail miserably at attempting to use politics to their advantage this kind of attitude is linked to a lack of confidence and skill in negotiation that women demonstrate right across the work place she says we know that women for example will not apply for a job unless they are confident that they could do all the components of it successfully men on the other hand will apply when they are confident that they could do a fraction of the work if youre going to succeed at playing against the rule book in an office to get somewhere then clearly the latter approach is required debra allcock author of high flying published by the industrial society agrees women are more likely to measure themselves on what they cannot do rather than what they can do underhand tactics which involve playing up their achievements is therefore alien they honestly think they are less deserving not necessarily than men but than any other employee it doesnt help that many more women than men work parttime she adds a whoyouknow type attitude to getting promotion is far more difficult to achieve if youre not there all the time to see who the people are to know and then theres the fact that many women dont like admitting their ambition says mackenzie davey in terms of their social identity it was difficult for many of the women i interviewed to reconcile maintaining a positive image of their femininity with a desire for power prestige and progression aha stop right there if women wont admit to ambition isnt it possible that they wont admit to using the tools to get there either in other words isnt it possible that those who say they wouldnt resort to politicking to get on are telling porkies or at least exaggerating occupational psychologist hannah ellis certainly thinks so office politics like ambition are perceived as masculine and macho and some women therefore have difficulty in positioning themselves within its framework its not necessarily that theyre lying when they say they dont use underhand tactics just that they dont regard their behaviour as such in fact some research has found that women can be far greater political animals than men a recent study from deskdemon a website for pas and secretaries is one in a long line to have discovered that employees on the whole prefer working for men for this very reason cary cooper organisational psychologist at the university of manchester institute of science and technology explains particularly in industries such as law and finance where there are fewer women they remain controlled by the predominant masculine culture the queen bee personality where aggression and macho tactics rule can be very strong its as if women feel the need to be even more political than men to make up for the fact that theyre female underneath the interesting thing is that theyll rarely admit to it on the other hand says ellis you could argue that we are likely to be harder on women than men even when they display the same behaviour we have ingrained notions of what is proper female behaviour that is not political and when they deviate from that we are quick to throw wild accusations she says when a woman tells someone off for instance she may be seen as being aggressive and irrational whereas her male counterpart is seen as assertive and fair sheer hite gender guru and author of sex and business agrees women tend to treat each other as bitch or best friend she says my boss is a bat from hell a bitch on wheels complains one secretary in her latest study according to organisational psychologist marilyn davidson it may be time the debate on office politics moved away from gender altogether the truth is that negative politiking is most likely to occur in offices where job security is high irrespective of the balance of males and females says professor davidson it makes even the least naturally competitive people start vying with colleagues in a fight to keep their job excessive competition at the top of industries such as banking and retail can mean companies in these sectors are the worst offenders says beverley stone author of confronting office politics people redefine company goals to suit their own purposes managers are wellplaced to empirebuild and conflicts tend to arise between departments the trend for hotdesking also breeds office politics says christopher early organisational psychologist at indiana university without any space to call their own people feel unstable undervalued and are rife for misusing power mackenzie davey adds that the decreasingly hierarchical organisational structures that are currently in vogue may also be to blame in the oldfashioned bureaucratic structures its clear and explicit who holds power and who doesnt she says in the flatter organisations its much more difficult to know who are the people who can pull strings but before you feel tempted to run screaming from your office in an attempt to get away from all thats political take comfort in the views of jane clarke author of office politics backstabbing bitching buckpassing bullying mention office politics and thats what people think of but in fact politics is simply defined as the informal rather than the formal way of getting things done and thats inevitable in any environment whether its a country company or even home where there are conflicting objectives clashing priorities and different styles says dr clarke in fact she adds office politics are constructive when employees learn where the power lies understand how to obtain it for themselves and have the skill to use it to pursue their goals its only destructive when motivation is purely selfish or unethical,2002-01,female b fed workplace politics alone fact youre growing breed according new study say woman increasingly

the equal opportunities commission yesterday slammed britains progress in closing the pay gap between men and women after official figures showed it had widened among top earners according to the annual new earnings survey published yesterday the differential between mens and womens hourly pay narrowed by just between and last year leaving them still behind their male counterparts men earn an average of per hour women earn among highest earners the pay gap is wider still with the top of men paid more than a week up from against for the top of women a rise of the new figures reveal the shameful truth that britain is still failing to make any significant progress towards closing the gender pay gap said julie mellor chairman of the eoc women will remain the poorer sex until there is a radical change of working culture in all sectors and at all levels an eoc report on women in management also published yesterday showed that although of managers are now female they are still paid less per hour than male managers the proportion of female managers has only reached in sectors traditionally associated with women such as education health and social services barbara roche the minister for women admitted there was still much work to do in closing the pay gap but denied it was solely the responsibility of government we are committed to tackling the circumstances that lead to the pay gap and to doing this in partnership with business she said but this is not solely a matter for government what is also needed is a cultural change among employers so they properly value womens contribution to business success the government has introduced measures for reducing the gap including pay questionnaires making it easier for women to find out how much their male colleagues earn earnings differences vary by region the survey reveals with women in london taking home of their male counterparts hourly wage but women in wales earning as much as men,2002-01,equal opportunity

enable more families to take advantage of flexible high quality childcare at the moment many mothers are returning to work for absolutely no financial gain it is estimated that there are at least nannies in britain and a further registered childminders this increase reflects the booming economy and the fact that more parents are working full or part time while the average take home pay in

relief to parents employing them consequently according to nursery world parents are forced to pay their nannys wages tax and national insurance out of their already taxed salary the treasury insisted yesterday it could give tax relief only for registered carers the good news for nannies is that parents are increasingly offering extra benefits to attract them use of a mobile phone the family car

the government is set to miss its target of creating m new childcare places by because of bureaucracy and a failure to encourage entrepreneurs a report will claim tomorrow thinktank demos and consultants genderquake say that ministers need to help create a new industry to meet the needs of working families if the goals of their national childcare strategy are to be delivered the report highlights the ever more complex and precarious childcare arrangements being cobbled together by working families blaming this situation on the fact that the number of registered childminders fell by a third during the s while the government says it will need newlyqualified childcare workers to meet its targets the report points to recent estimates that show a total of up workers including unqualified staff are needed report author helen wilkinson said we must stop treating childcare as a burden that society has to bear grudgingly just so women can be allowed to go back to work there is an opportunity to grow a new and dynamic industry which can meet the needs of todays working families and at the same time provide employment and socially responsible business opportunities her report lays down a series of recommendations to improve the situation including the creation of a national childcare agency to help develop publicprivate provision it also proposes employers that invest in childcare should get tax breaks a new fund should be set up to attract investment and a recruitment campaign should be launched to bring men into the industry currently men make up less than of

the first ever uk national childcare strategy unveiled in was a historic event but four years on the child care gap remains significant and the government is in danger of failing to deliver on its own target of m new childcare places by why is this at the most basic level the demand for child care services is far outstripping supply at a time when the recruitment challenges facing the sector are greater than teacher and nursing shortages the number of qualified childcare workers would need to increase by over the next four years according to government figures the childcare commission which reported in estimated that over childcare workers would be needed over the next four years the cost of care also remains prohibitive for many working parents parents typically bear of the costs the typical cost for a family with two children one preschool the other school age is per year so many parents are left struggling to stitch together precarious childcare arrangements often reliant on grandparents or other friends and family employers for their part have been curiously absent from the child care debate partly because government policy has done little to encourage and reward familyfriendly employers in autumn the performance and innovation unit the governments own thinktank decided belatedly to conduct a review of the national childcare strategy no doubt the review will aid the decision making process in the run up to the spring budget but money alone is not enough beyond the headlines and statistics about the childcare gap individuals and organisations are working in imaginative ways to deliver change on the ground but the system is disabling rather than enabling departmental responsibility for childcare is unclear and holistic government is lacking peoples energies are spent navigating the funding maze rather than on developing and delivering childcare services unwieldy bureaucratic child care partnerships the primary vehicle for delivering change locally have lacked focus been shortterm in their approach and have suffered skills deficits in marketing and business development partly as a consequence child care entrepreneurs small scale as well as large have not received the support they need to grow their services and enterprises a number of announcements during illustrated the governments desire to accelerate delivery on the ground and on the surface at least there appears to be an increased emphasis on the business of child care new funding commitments are bringing much needed capital to child care entrepreneurs and poor areas the government has also established an expert group to ensure access to public and private finance and a m business support programme for child care and nursery education providers has been unveiled with business advisers available to support childcare partnerships these are important new initiatives and they reflect a clear shift in priorities towards business development and shared investment in innovative childcare solutions however they do not fit clearly within a strategic framework for defining and delivering the next phase of the national childcare strategy nor do they grapple decisively enough with the problems impeding delivery on the ground after all if we take the business of child care seriously rather than seeing childcare as a burden which taxpayers bear this requires much more than incremental reform it means recognising that child care is as important to the national economy as an effective transport system it means recognising that the national childcare strategy provides an opportunity to grow a new and dynamic industry which can meet the needs of working parents but which can also provide employment and socially responsible business opportunities and it means creating the intermediary institutions which can enable and grow the fledgling childcare industry one solution would be for a childcare development agency to take responsibility for the child care industry this nondepartmental public agency could be founded through a publicprivate partnership with start up finance from central government its job would be to incubate and accelerate the growth of the industry government funds could be matched by privatesector funds including the venture capital industry but it could have nonprofit status to allow it to access the broadest range of funding sources financial surplus should be reinvested into growing more childcare businesses strategic investment business incubation and support engaging employers in the childcare challenge empowering parents and communities to help themselves and sharing knowledge and experience will be critical if the first ever national childcare strategy is to go down in the history books as a turning point for working families and the catalyst for growing a new and dynamic sector of the economy helen wilkinson is the author of creche barriers how britain can grow its childcare industry published by

the forgotten heroine of the race to unravel the mystery of human dna is to be honoured posthumously as part of a government crusade against sexism in science rosalind franklin has become a feminist cause clbre the dedicated scientist held back by her male colleagues refusal to acknowledge her vital role in one of the most important scientific discoveries of the century while the three male scientists who helped establish the doublehelix structure of dna shared the nobel prize for their breakthrough based in large part on franklins detailed xray images of atoms she won little public recognition and her early death robbed her of later fame rosy was dismissed in james watsons account of the discovery the double helix as a buttonedup bluestocking who her scientific partner believed had to go or be put in her place only recently has her reputation begun to be restored now patricia hewitt the trade and industry secretary is to create a franklin medal in her honour to raise the profile of other women scientists with a annual prize for exceptional innovation hewitt has also ordered an inquiry headed by professor susan greenfield the neurologist and presenter of the bbc tv series brain story into the barriers keeping women out of top science jobs a report to be published by the government tomorrow maximising returns reveals that at any one time there are around women science and engineering graduates not working mostly after leaving to have children only a third of those who return from a career break take jobs that use their university qualifications we have a lot of very clever women going to waste said a source close to hewitt who will outline the findings in a speech this week to the daphne jackson trust which helps women scientists return to their careers patricia is very clear that the economy is losing out if you are only concentrating on half your potential workforce franklin who died of ovarian cancer at the age of faced the barriers hewitt is now trying to overcome she nearly lost her place at cambridge university after her father who disapproved of degrees for women refused to pay her tuition fees he was eventually shamed into it by her aunt and mother franklins break came when she was hired by kings college in to work on the dna project as a crystallographer mapping the location of atoms within a structure at the time women were not even allowed to take lunch in the senior common room her partnership with maurice wilkins who was racing francis crick and james watson to find the structure of dna was strained apparently wilkins resented her involvement but when he showed her dna images to watson their rival realised she was on the right track when franklin announced in that she was leaving for another job wilkins wrote to the cambridge pair that our dark lady leaves us next week at last the decks are clear but by the time his letter reached crick and watson they had announced their discovery of the doublehelix based in no small part on franklins research crick later admitted franklin was only two steps away from the solution when she left kings it was not sexism that denied franklin the nobel prize in she died before it was awarded and it is not given posthumously but the prize can only be shared three ways raising questions over whether she would have been given the credit had she lived franklins sister jennifer glyn is delighted about the medal scheme rosalind would have been amazed and immensely pleased at this recognition of her work she said although the number of women with science engineering and technology degrees rose by a fifth between and they are sparsely represented at the highest levels there have only ever been female nobel science laureates the women that science forgot astronomer caroline herschel was the first woman to discover a comet by the time she died in she had mapped thousands of galaxies overshadowed by her brother the astronomer royal she played down her achievements

fathers groups yesterday welcomed the decision of one of britains top chief executives to quit his ayear job to spend more time with his wife and four children fathers direct said danny oneils decision to step down as chief executive of the britannic group so he could be with his triplets as they grew up would be an inspiration to fathers across britain after finding he could not successfully balance family life with the pressures of running one of britains largest companies mr oneil has quit his post and plans to work three days a week as a consultant mr oneil said he began rethinking his priorities this year when his eldest daughter siobhan left home for university climbing the career ladder meant long hours and a great deal of travel and he felt he had missed out on her childhood the consultancy which will pay about half what he previously earned will allow him to spend much more time with his nineyearold triplets patrick conor and caitlin at their home in glasgow this means that fathers lower down the corporate structure will also feel able to say their children are a priority corporations will have to realise that men need the same sort of flexibility at work as women enjoy said jack osullivan of fathers direct men in britain work some of the longest hours in europe a report by the european commission network on childcare revealed fathers with children aged under work an average of hours per week mr oneil said commuting between glasgow london and birmingham where britannic has its headquarters took up an immense amount of time when this was added to frequent foreign trips his worklife balance seemed out of kilter i have been at the top for a while now and have proved i can do this job he said but i have not had the right balance between my personal life and work the triplets are at an age where i want to spend more time with them and they want to do more things with me mr oneils decision has the backing of his wife patricia who is also giving up her part time job as a practice nurse so that she too can concentrate on their children there is strong evidence to suggest most men increase their working hours after their children are born largely because their partners tend to reduce their hours and the shortfall in income has to be met,2002-01,father group yesterday welcomed decision one britain top chief executive quit ayear

it has been heralded as the cornerstone of new labours drive to modernise public services and tackle social exclusion but policy experts have warned there is still scant evidence of joint working a report on health and social services partnerships by leading thinktank the kings fund due to be published later this month has found little to indicate the initiative is delivering better quality care the report partnerships under pressure will also warn that the governments plans to impose structural solutions to joint working such as care trusts and its focus on acute care are hindering the development of alternative sustainable local partnerships penny banks fellow in health and social care at the thinktank said the evidence is yet to come that they are delivering its conclusion mirrors that of an assessment of five jointworking programmes by parliaments spending watchdog which found that only three of the government schemes the rough sleepers unit rsu early years development and childcare partnerships and business link partnerships have achieved tangible benefits so far the number of rough sleepers has fallen by from in june to in june the target to provide a free parttime nursery place for all four year olds had been met by march and new childcare places had been created exceeding the target of by the productivity and profitability of businesses assisted by business link partnerships is also higher than those of nonassisted businesses but the national audit office nao said it was too early for there to be any measurable longterm benefit for the remaining two projects sure start which supports disadvantaged preschool children and exports promotion body british trade international the report joining up to improve public services also found that there is still little joint working between central government departments while local organisations often lack commitment to the approach for example the rsu found it difficult to persuade councils and nhs trusts to treat rough sleepers as a priority unless it provided them with direct funding the auditors added that joint working does not always lead to greater cost efficiency for example the average cost of providing a childcare placement is with early years development and childcare partnerships compared with under previous arrangements however the cost of reducing rough sleeping has dropped considerably prior to the establishment of the rsu it cost on average to take one person off the streets this has now fallen to this decrease suggests that the provision of more integrated services including health and social support is more cost effective in helping rough sleepers and preventing rough sleeping than previous arrangements states the report but mps from the public accounts select committee have criticised the reports value given the lack of financial data available to draw meaningful conclusions about the impact of joint working the report warns if parliament is not able to identity total expenditure and outcomes achieved by joint initiatives then parliament cannot take assurances that taxpayers money has been well spent labour mp alan williams pointed out that they could not check this because only the costs of central government expenditure were available for the nao to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the programmes how can we know if we do not know the full cost whether the government is bearing a fair load whether it is just taking on other peoples load or whether others are now carrying more because government sums are going down in one programme while going up in another he said the select committee also heard that there was little takeup of joint working by mainstream providers mavis mcdonald of the cabinet office admitted we havent cracked it just yet were working on it this problem was highlighted last september by the association of directors of social work which warned that sure start was poaching social workers from mainstream services exacerbating staff shortages another obstacle to the wider takeup of health and social care partnerships identified by the kings fund is the fast pace of nhs modernisation a problem recognised by the chief inspector of social services denise platt in her th annual report last august despite these difficulties ms mcdonald and naiomi eisenstadt head of sure start told the select committee that joint working was being extended to cover health inequalities children at risk drug programmes and the voluntary sector through a series of crosscutting spending reviews but several of the mps remained unconvinced with many suggesting the approach was merely a nebulous concept citing some of the other jointworking initiatives they had analysed such as the benefits agency and employment service

welcome to lean street an ordinary road in a deprived innercity area somewhere in england it is populated by a variety of families couples and single people of different ages and backgrounds and with different social problems from a pregnant teenager to a jobless yearold the neighbours preoccupations vary from how to cope with two troublesome teenage boys to how to stay on top of a drink problem and whether it is safe to walk to the shops all require help but all require help of a particular kind it is this diversity of the nature of social exclusion that makes tackling it such a challenge under the umbrella of the social exclusion unit the government has introduced a raft of programmes designed to work across government departments to provide joined up solutions to joined up problems but getting a clear coherent picture of how they are intended to work together is elusive and made more difficult by the fact that many schemes operate only in certain parts of the country to try to demonstrate what might happen in an ideal world we have had to create lean street where all the programmes are in place and running simultaneously at no lives yearold tina with her mother tina is pregnant and was about to drop out of school when she was allocated a teenage pregnancy learning mentor who is ensuring that the education system accommodates the birth of her child tina will be able to attend classes up until the delivery with time off to attend hospital check ups and will return to her studies when she is ready the mentor is employed as part of a teenage and parent initiative funded by a department for education and skills standards fund grant to date this m grant has been awarded to local education authorities leas with the highest conception rates to help reintegrate schoolage parents the scheme is being expanded this year to leas tina receives home visits throughout her pregnancy from a midwife funded by the sure start plus programme to work specifically with teenage motherstobe sure start plus aimed at young parents operates in areas lean street is in one of nine areas piloting subsidised childcare for to yearolds whose families cannot help look after children tina would also be eligible for help with childcare costs should she decide to go on a training course or work experience under the new deal for lone parents when she gets a job she will be eligible for working families tax credit which includes a childcare tax credit if the childcare is registered at no lives yearold keith with his parents and younger brother keith got into trouble a few years ago for breaking into cars he left school at and has since been hanging around with his friends the youth offending team has referred keith to a personal adviser from connexions the governments youth service targeted at to yearolds most at risk of underachievement the adviser meets with keith once a fortnight to assess whether education training or employment is the most appropriate avenue for him to pursue and has identified a btec in performing arts that keith would like to take up keith has fallen out with his parents and is about to move into a hostel so his adviser will also help him to get income support and free meals if he decides to go to college he will also receive an education maintenance allowance piloted in a third of leas to encourage pupils to remain in education beyond the allowance comes to a week plus a bonus at the end of each completed term and a achievement award there are connexions personal advisers in regions but the scheme is being extended nationally keiths brother joe is he is at risk of being excluded from school because of his disruptive behaviour in class when he bothers to turn up joe had been spotted playing truant and being a nuisance with his friends by a neighbourhood warden who patrols the area she contacted the head teacher and joe has now been assigned a learning mentor who provides additional onetoone support these mentors are funded by excellence in cities a programme providing extra support for city schools he may also be supported by the childrens fund implemented in areas which develops plans for assisting children at risk of permanent exclusion joe attends a new youth club the warden has helped set up and a crime prevention initiative under new deal for communities ndc providing activities as well as advice on drugs issues and teenage pregnancy at no mavis and husband george have just had new house locks fitted free of charge as part of a locks for pensioners scheme funded by the crime reduction programmes m initiative to counter burglary it is one of projects designed to improve safety in high crime areas the couple have had both their house and car broken into and have been intimidated by the gangs of youths hanging around the street now a neighbourhood warden scheme one of employing wardens provides a uniformed presence to tackle nuisance and cut crime as a result youngsters are attending a youth club and washing residents cars and mavis and george feel safer going out during the day a year into the scheme burglaries and car crime have fallen as lean street is also an ndc area there are across england with bn funding over the next years residents have identified vehicle crime as a local priority and money will be spent on reduction programmes located in one of the most deprived local authority areas the neighbourhood will also have a share of the m neighbourhood renewal fund over the next three years to be spent on improving local services according to local priorities mavis and george think poor transport links and rubbish collection should be improved at no live bob and his wife carol their two children have both left home last year yearold bob

the benefit agency and a private company which has helped residents find work in the past six months it is one of the services initiated by the ndc neighbourhood manager who is responsible for finding the best solutions to local problems because residents said they found the jobcentre in town hard to get to and impersonal he negotiated on their behalf with service providers about how employment advice should be delivered locally some local communities have neighbourhood managers at no a john has moved into a flat after spending years sleeping rough following the breakup of his marriage the yearold alcoholic received help to find accommodation and tackle his drink problem from a multiagency contact and assessment team he is now being supported by one of tenancy sustainment teams across the country six of them in london where they are helping former rough sleepers rebuild their lives the tenancy sustainment team helped john furnish his flat very cheaply through a furniture recycling project and showed him how to pay his rent and utility bills regularly mental health workers and staff from detox and rehabilitation agencies are represented on the teams john attends an alcohol rehab day clinic and is learning horticultural skills at a community garden that the team has put him in touch with pushing the limits launched by the prime minister in a blaze of publicity four years ago the social exclusion unit has reported on five main issues school exclusions teenage pregnancy deprived neighbourhoods rough sleepers and young people not in education employment or training its recommendations have resulted in a variety of governmentfunded programmes the governments own figures suggest that the unit has made an impact there was a drop in pregnant unders in the number of children excluded from school fell by more than a third in there are almost twothirds fewer people sleeping rough on the streets more than young people identified as not being in education training or employment have been helped to settle into a job or fulltime course by the connexions service however the units achievements are limited by the relatively few areas in which many of the programmes

welcome to lean street an ordinary road in a deprived innercity area somewhere in england it is populated by a variety of families couples and single people of different ages and backgrounds and with different social problems from a pregnant teenager to a jobless yearold the neighbours preoccupations vary from how to cope with two troublesome teenage boys to how to stay on top of a drink problem and whether it is safe to walk to the shops all require help but all require help of a particular kind it is this diversity of the nature of social exclusion that makes tackling it such a challenge under the umbrella of the social exclusion unit the government has introduced a raft of programmes designed to work across government departments to provide joined up solutions to joined up problems but getting a clear coherent picture of how they are intended to work together is elusive and made more difficult by the fact that many schemes operate only in certain parts of the country to try to demonstrate what might happen in an ideal world we have had to create lean street where all the programmes are in place and running simultaneously at no lives yearold tina with her mother tina is pregnant and was about to drop out of school when she was allocated a teenage pregnancy learning mentor who is ensuring that the education system accommodates the birth of her child tina will be able to attend classes up until the delivery with time off to attend hospital check ups and will return to her studies when she is ready the mentor is employed as part of a teenage and parent initiative funded by a department for education and skills standards fund grant to date this m grant has been awarded to local education authorities leas with the highest conception rates to help reintegrate schoolage parents the scheme is being expanded this year to leas tina receives home visits throughout her pregnancy from a midwife funded by the sure start plus programme to work specifically with teenage motherstobe sure start plus aimed at young parents operates in areas lean street is in one of nine areas piloting subsidised childcare for to yearolds whose families cannot help look after children tina would also be eligible for help with childcare costs should she decide to go on a training course or work experience under the new deal for lone parents when she gets a job she will be eligible for working families tax credit which includes a childcare tax credit if the childcare is registered at no lives yearold keith with his parents and younger brother keith got into trouble a few years ago for breaking into cars he left school at and has since been hanging around with his friends the youth offending team has referred keith to a personal adviser from connexions the governments youth service targeted at to yearolds most at risk of underachievement the adviser meets with keith once a fortnight to assess whether education training or employment is the most appropriate avenue for him to pursue and has identified a btec in performing arts that keith would like to take up keith has fallen out with his parents and is about to move into a hostel so his adviser will also help him to get income support and free meals if he decides to go to college he will also receive an education maintenance allowance piloted in a third of leas to encourage pupils to remain in education beyond the allowance comes to a week plus a bonus at the end of each completed term and a achievement award there are connexions personal advisers in regions but the scheme is being extended nationally keiths brother joe is he is at risk of being excluded from school because of his disruptive behaviour in class when he bothers to turn up joe had been spotted playing truant and being a nuisance with his friends by a neighbourhood warden who patrols the area she contacted the head teacher and joe has now been assigned a learning mentor who provides additional onetoone support these mentors are funded by excellence in cities a programme providing extra support for city schools he may also be supported by the childrens fund implemented in areas which develops plans for assisting children at risk of permanent exclusion joe attends a new youth club the warden has helped set up and a crime prevention initiative under new deal for communities ndc providing activities as well as advice on drugs issues and teenage pregnancy at no mavis and husband george have just had new house locks fitted free of charge as part of a locks for pensioners scheme funded by

youngsters are attending a youth club and washing residents cars and mavis and george feel safer going out during the day a year into the scheme burglaries and car crime have fallen as lean street is also an ndc area there are across england with bn funding over the next years residents have identified vehicle crime as a local priority and money will be spent on reduction programmes located in one of the most deprived local authority areas the neighbourhood will also have a share of the m neighbourhood renewal fund over the next three years to be spent on improving local services according to local priorities mavis and george think poor transport links and rubbish collection should be improved at no live bob and his wife carol their two children have both left home last year yearold bob

advice should be delivered locally some local communities have neighbourhood managers at no a john has moved into a flat after spending years sleeping rough following the breakup of his marriage the yearold alcoholic received help to find accommodation and tackle his drink problem from a multiagency contact and assessment team he is now being supported by one of tenancy sustainment teams across

project and showed him how to pay his rent and utility bills regularly mental health workers and staff from detox and rehabilitation agencies are represented on the teams john attends an alcohol rehab day clinic and is learning horticultural skills at a community garden that the team has put him in touch with pushing the limits launched by the prime minister in a blaze of publicity four years ago the social exclusion unit has reported on five main issues school exclusions teenage pregnancy deprived neighbourhoods rough sleepers and young people not in education employment or training its recommendations have resulted in a variety of governmentfunded programmes the governments own figures suggest that the unit has made an impact there was a drop in pregnant unders in the number of children excluded from school fell by more than a third in there are almost twothirds fewer people sleeping rough on the streets more than young people identified as not being in education training or employment have been helped to settle into a job or fulltime course by the connexions service however the units achievements are limited by the relatively few areas in which many of the programmes

in todays workplace young men are often spoken of as a lost tribe who must be protected in case the women grab all the glory against this comes an academic paper that shows that young women are lost and confused too dr kate mackenzie davey of londons birkbeck college told this years british psychological association conference on organisational psychology that female graduates feel compromised by the office politics required to advance their careers her research found that the female graduates divided work into crawling and backstabbing on the one hand and quiet efficiency on the other with the former likely to be rewarded at the expense of the latter nearly all those interviewed assumed that they fell into the quiet efficient category and were resigned to failing in their careers they assumed that the exhibitionism they believed necessary for success comes naturally to men and they tended to describe what men do as games and nice women dont want to play those games anyway although some admit they would not be so nice if they thought they had a chance of winning it is ironic that those interviewed feel socially excluded because it is assumed that women are racing ahead on the strength of their superior social skills davey found that women regarded assessments as an opportunity to take on board constructive criticism rather than as an opportunity to show off and that they spoke in meetings only when they had something relevant to say the belief that quiet efficiency will be overlooked may be selffulfilling because by valuing themselves for their efficiency they are more reluctant to to talk themselves into jobs for which they do not believe they are fully qualified the root of the problem seems to be that young women still consider that success can be achieved only at the expense of personal integritythe positive note that comes out of the research is that some young women see the disadvantages they believe they face as a challenge and are more determined to become successful on their terms rather than sell out,2002-01,today workplace young men often spoken lost tribe must protected case woman grab glory come academic paper show young woman lost

imagine pat from eastenders taking up a post on the strategic rail authority or coronation streets deirdre discussing her role at the audit commission it may sound farfetched but a government report published today recommends that soap operas should be used to help attract more women to serve on public bodies the report for department for transport local government and the regions found that women made up only of the boards of bodies sponsored by the department such bodies include the highways agency the planning inspectorate english partnerships the electoral commission the housing corporation and the local government commission as well as the strategic rail authority and the audit commission to increase the recruitment of women to the boards of these organisations the report says soap opera storylines should be linked to public appointments it also recommends an awarenessraising campaign through womens magazines such as womans own or good housekeeping the study by the office of public management found there was no apparent discrimination in the recruitment process to such posts since applications from women tend to be more successful than those from men it claims that one of the biggest problems is encouraging women to apply in the first place more than five times more men than women applied for dtlr appointments the report also called for the culture of public bodies to change to become more welcoming to different kinds of people and different ways of doing things it says mixed boards were particularly good at strategic changes they are more flexible and they create a better image of the organisation the government currently has a target of equal representation of women and men in public appointments a spokeswoman for the equal opportunities commission said the overall number of women on the boards of dtlrsponsored bodies is lagging behind the national average for public bodies so we welcome the departments commitment to using a wide range of measures to boost the number of women appointed she added the eoc wants to see the quality of the public positions held by women improve as well as an increase in the number of positions

today in sunderland at least women will be attacked and beaten by their male partners the number may be even higher than that police can only record the incidents they are called to and social workers believe the true figure may be more like like other female victims of domestic violence across britain the women of wearside have until now been given little option when they want to escape a violent partner if they crave a halt to the beatings and the abuse they have to flee the family home and seek refuge with other battered women and their children but in sunderland a scheme is being developed where instead of battered women being forced into refuges it will be the perpetrators of the violence who are removed from the family home they will be placed in a specially staffed hostel where they will undergo counselling the scheme hinges partly on a tenancy agreement drawn up by sunderland housing group which has taken over the running of the city councils properties under the agreement any tenant responsible for domestic violence is deemed to have broken the contract and must leave the property sharon kane coordinator of the wearside domestic violence forum says why should the woman who is the innocent party be the one to have to leave the family home instead we are going to provide accommodation for the perpetrators of domestic violence and offer them help if they are prepared to change the statistics for sunderland and surrounding districts make shocking reading eight hundred women and children all fleeing violent men were turned away in from local refuges one in the city itself and another in nearby washington each has only beds providing space for an average of just families last november alone police in sunderlands three operational districts were called out to incidents of domestic violence in our experience you can probably treble that figure says kane then look at what percentage of these attacks are in the highrisk category that could be and you have a better picture of what is really happening a clause in a tenancy agreement making domestic violence a case for eviction is not a new initiative either in sunderland or elsewhere but linking it to a specific programme of counselling for violent men who want to change and who will not be allowed back into the house until they do is a radical departure the sunderland housing group works closely with the domestic violence forum and is helping find a property in which to set up the hostel john craggs speaking for the group says the clause has been in the tenancy agreement for quite some time but he cannot remember any man being evicted for domestic violence we have been taking domestic violence seriously as a housing issue for a very long time craggs says the provision has existed and there has been intent to support but it has never been taken up it has been the situation normally that the woman has wanted to leave the house and then wouldnt return but that will now change once the hostel is up and running believes clare phillipson one of the workers at wearside women in need and by general agreement the driving force behind the scheme what we have had is women who are the victims of domestic violence saying their male partner will have nowhere to go if they throw them out or they fear that the man will kill himself if he is evicted she says but they will soon not have those concerns we will be offering somewhere for the men to go and live to receive counselling and learn how to address their behaviour to realise they have committed a serious crime and that they have to change phillipson is adamant that battered women must not see their only options as staying at home and living in fear of attack or fleeing to a refuge she welcomes the chance to work with the citys biggest landlord in seeing that women get a better deal she quotes an instance where one social landlord in the northeast threatened to evict a woman if the sound of her male partner beating her up got any worse the neighbours were complaining thats why its good to work with sunderland housing says phillipson we all know that were pulling in the same direction the scheme will cost some to set up then a year to run but the groups involved are confident they will be able to raise the money needed through various funding agencies it is incredibly costeffective says phillipson what is the cost of the damage done by violent men to women and children thats a figure that cant be calculated wearside women in need is on,2002-01,today sunderland least woman attacked beaten male partner number may

can the government really achieve its year target of eliminating child poverty research published today by the daycare trust the national childcare campaign group questions whether the range of initiatives aimed at disadvantaged children in england is either sufficiently coherent or sustainable in the longer term to ensure that the target is met it is thought there are at least different funding streams associated with antipoverty schemes emanating from the department of health the home office the department of transport local government and the regions and the treasury and despite the impressive number of initiatives their coverage is by no means comprehensive by contrast the welsh assembly has decided to adopt a unified approach creating a single support grant fund that will bring together all the main schemes and funding flows aimed at supporting children and young people in wales jane hutt welsh minister for health and social services describes the new children and youth support fund or cymorth as coherent and efficient the daycare trust research carried out by hilary land professor of family policy and child welfare at bristol university analyses the range of health education and childcare initiatives aimed at children living in poverty in england it concludes that agencies both voluntary and statutory are frequently hindered by the sheer number and variety of initiatives and that the mix of programmes is unlikely to meet the needs of anything like all children suffering the effects of poverty and social exclusion large numbers of disadvantaged children land points out live in areas not targeted for help and the shortterm financing of many schemes means that the agencies involved are unable to intervene and provide support in the longer term they cannot build and maintain the human capacity necessary to turn round longestablished problems associated with exclusion and deprivation it does not follow that land the trust or indeed other childcare agencies take a negative stance against programmes such as sure start or the national childcare strategy nor against the childcare tax credit or working families tax credit neera sharma policy adviser at childrens charity barnardos says sure start which by should be helping disadvantaged young children is demonstrating that sustained action brings tangible benefits the process of mainstreaming good practice emerging from the programme should provide a lesson for the government about the importance of moving away from shorttermism and narrow targeting sharma adds yet even by sure start will be reaching only about one in three of all unders living in poverty similarly as land outlines in her report meeting the child poverty challenge the national childcare strategy has delivered only a very modest improvement in services from meeting the needs of one in nine unders in to one in seven in and not only are there very marked regional variations in provision of day nurseries playgroups childminders and outofschool clubs but over the past year there has been a net reduction in the number of available childminders and playgroup places not surprisingly the daycare trust is particularly concerned about this as a result of demand for childcare outstripping supply it says the typical cost of a fulltime nursery place is now a week rising to in inner london while a fulltime place with a childminder is some a week a recent survey of community nurseries with fees below the market rate found two in three reporting that they were threatened with closure stephen burke the trusts director points out that parents still pay threequarters of the cost of childcare although working families on lower incomes now get tax credit help this commonly amounts to less than a third of the cost of a nursery place at the same time the vast majority of workless families get no help at all which affects m children of whom only can access services paid for by their local authority says burke millions of children in workless families are therefore missing out on learning and development opportunities preschool education however continues to be developed as a universal service funded by general taxation all fouryearolds are now guaranteed a place and by the end of this year the guarantee is to be extended to cover twothirds of threeyearolds critics say this exemplifies a lack of joinedup thinking by government possibly a result of wellintentioned pressure on whitehall departments to come up with ideas and schemes as a result as lands research suggests labours original commitment to push through an integrated programme of educational financial and social care help for the m children getting a poor start in life has led to something of a muddle this is particularly evident in support available for disabled children and their families almost children and young people have some form of disability and are almost twice as likely as their peers to live in low income households yet as sharma points out less than of government funding for local early years and childcare partnerships a cornerstone of the national childcare strategy are aimed directly at meeting the needs of disabled children so there continues to be a lack of good quality affordable childcare for them campaigners in england are now casting envious eyes across offas dyke the new welsh children and youth support fund will bring together the funding flows and structures associated with among others sure start the national childcare strategy the childrens fund and waless youth access initiative and play grant there will be a specific grant for the first five years starting in april next year but thereafter the funding will be in mainstream grant allocations every welsh council is required to have childrens partnerships with relevant agencies and every local partnership is expected to submit detailed plans and applications for funding by this october many funded projects will be delivered in wales through integrated local childrens centres though sure starts special focus on the underfours will be retained i want to maximise the benefits of these links says hutt for example there are common themes of play and support for parenting skills that are relevant to all stages of childhood while priority will be given to the most disadvantaged localities she adds that the more holistic the support the better the outcome the plan gets wholehearted support from joe howsam who speaks on childcare issues in wales for the association of directors of social

parents of toddlers can save nearly every school term under the expanding free nursery places scheme although whether you are entitled to free provision depends primarily on where you live the government has pledged that by september it will fund free nursery places for all threeyearolds whose parents want them starting the term after their third birthday the scheme guarantees five twoandahalf hour sessions per week this is already the case for fouryearolds who are entitled to a free parttime place in an eligible setting which may be a school nursery or reception class a private nursery or playgroup and as the government gears up for universal provision for threeyearolds in which means a target of giving at least of threeyearolds access to a free place some parents who pay for their toddlers to attend a private provider will find they are already entitled to a free parttime place and a consequent reduction in the fees they are paying the term after their child turns three but many parents are confused about whether their children are entitled to a free place during this interim period at present entitlement to a free place which can reduce private nursery fees by up to per term depends primarily on where you live and a range of criteria such as social deprivation in your area the rollout of central government funding for threeyearolds nursery places to local authorities is being allocated on the basis of need if you live for example in newcastle upon tyne or the inner london borough of islington both of which have long had a high level of commitment to the provision of nursery education and are recognised as deprived areas by central government your threeyearold will automatically have access to a free parttime nursery place if you want it regardless of your level of wealth newcastle city council says that of the areas threeyearolds currently have access to a free good quality early years education place islington too can offer free parttime places to all threeyearolds whose parents want them in fact of islingtons children have fulltime places in councilrun nurseries attached to primary schools before the age of four islington is pushed however to quite reach the governments target of universal takeup because it does not suit parents in certain sectors of the authoritys mobile and multicultural population to send their children to an early years setting some prefer for example to keep their preschool children at home within the extended family but areas like newcastle and islington which already receive enough funding to provide free nursery places for all their threeyearolds are not the norm far more local authorities as yet receive only sufficient funding to provide free places to a percentage of those who want them and it is down to each authoritys early years partnership to decide the criteria for how that money should be allocated richmonduponthames in surrey for example which is largely an affluent area but with pockets of relative deprivation has approximately threeyearolds some of them already attend councilmaintained nursery classes around attend nonmaintained private settings and the remaining either stay at home or have other care arrangements the funding richmond received for the spring term was sufficient to pay for free parttime places not a figure that would easily divide between the children in eligible settings so its early years partnership strategy team had to work out a fair set of criteria the first was social need with children identified by its social services department receiving free places second it decided that all threeyearolds in settings in the boroughs four most disadvantaged wards would get free places third all children living in these four wards who attended settings outside their boundaries received a free place these three criteria accounted for of the available places the rest were then allocated by date of birth with places going to the oldest threeyearolds those born before june working all of this out was described by one team member as an administrative and mathematical nightmare and not one easily explained to parents but allocating free places for next term should be much easier as the government moves towards universal funding richmond will get enough money to pay for free places split between the children in eligible settings this should allow an acrosstheboard policy of giving a free parttime place to every threeyearold for the two terms prior to their fourth birthday parents who want to check on their own childs entitlement to a free nursery place should start by contacting their local authoritys childrens information service and asking what the local po sition is you should then make sure that the nursery provider you want your child to attend is participating in your local authoritys plan for nursery education the final twist is that if you choose a provider which has decided not to

how equal is stcentury woman in the workplace when it comes to management of managers are women yet they earn considerably less than their male counterparts less per hour according to new figures from the equal opportunities commission there has been significant progress since the mids the number of female executives has doubled and the number of female company directors has tripled despite these increases only one in company directors are women the eocs report into british management reveals that female managers are more concentrated in certain careers and clusters continue in particular industries there are plenty of them in personnel training and industrial relations yet there are fewer than one in five it managers in some industries they remain non existent at certain levels for example there are no female chief constables a higher proportion of women managers work in the public sector than in the private sector and they constitute twothirds of managers in health and social work and just in construction the findings are not a huge surprise says eoc chairwoman julie mellor they confirm our suspicions that women simply arent represented at senior level in many industries what is particularly disappointing is how big the impact of raising children is on womens careers female managers are much less likely to have dependent children than their male colleagues the eoc remains concerned about britains glass ceiling where senior positions are still mysteriously elusive to women in some industries the report says the eoc would like to see employers opening nontraditional opportunities through staff development and improved recruitment practices sarah best senior policy advisor at the confederation of british industry suggests a few ideas that these companies might implement we could learn a thing or two from the us and adopt best practice such as mentoring networking and career tracking schemes maledominated industries could also do with an image makeover she says employers have actively to change the image of their companies and this has to work its way down to universities colleges and schools careers advisors in schools have to be more imaginative and ensure females arent just channelled into the traditional stereotypical industries such as social services she also believes the state should provide childcare behavioural expert and corporate trainer judi james says the reason women are highly represented in certain industries is not due to any genderspecific psychology its a really iffy stereotype to think women prefer the caring professions the problem is that the doors of opportunity are far more visible and open in those industries and this is not necessarily the case in the private sector or in maledominated industries james has been working with large numbers of female graduates who are choosing to work in the financial sector at the moment more women than men are moving into accountancy but i dont know what happens to them after that when i see people being groomed for partnership level i dont see many women the government also believes that career attitudes of men and women are creating pay differentials women have traditionally seen certain highly paid sectors of the economy as unattractive speaking at a recent conference on women in it trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt said the current situation is bad for women it means they are missing out on opportunities to earn the higher wages available in the it sector its also bad for business and bad for the economy the governments strategy is to encourage more women to take up careers in science engineering and technology set free it software is being supplied by us software company macromedia to schools running computer clubs ambassadors of set are to visit schools to encourage girls in particular to choose the subjects as longterm careers and it compass a free online advice service for women is soon to be launched up to m is also being made available for the it sector from the dtis work life balance challenge fund this provides consultancy support for employees wanting to introduce innovative working practices an it industry dominated by men is using only half the available talent and creativity that is a particular cause for concern in an industry that despite current economic conditions has a growing demand for skilled labour said hewitt the eoc report makes recommendations to improve equality in the underrepresented industries it suggests promoting parttime work and flexible working and says employers have a duty to discourage the long hours culture james goes as far as to suggest that women may not be visible in these industries through choice i think women may be more ahead of the game than many think she says some of these senior jobs such as company directors arent up to much a lot of people are missing out on having an enjoyable life id like to know what these jobs have to offer thats so great ok youve got power but often what you can do is dictated by shareholders the working environment is solitary and if you make loads of money you dont have the time to enjoy it if women choose not to take certain senior managerial positions that is an individual matter but if a glass ceiling is suspected what can they do to break through it if there is resistance to progression then women may have to think creatively the climb up the ladder may not be linear says james women have to look at other ways of getting there it may mean moving sideways for a while or leapfrogging through certain jobs executive coach ian mcdermott says that it may be a case of managing upwards it is often senior staff who generate obstacles at work he says start to think of those above you as customers or clients you need to make them perceive you as someone who makes their life easier who can supply otherwise unavailable skills and information maintain a good rapport with them and make it clear that you are supporting them rather than acting as a threat for more information about the eoc log onto wwweocorguk and for the set initiative visit wwwsetwomengovuk,2002-02,equal stcentury

childcare costs have risen by up to per cent in the past year and the chancellors tax credits for working mothers may be to blame a new report to be published this week reveals a nursery place for a toddler now costs an average of a year almost as much as a minor private school with rates soaring even higher in london and the south east the report is expected to show that the average nursery place for a child under two now costs a week against less than last year a rise of more than four times the rate of inflation british parents already pay the highest childcare bills in europe the daycare trust a think tank warns in its report that the governments attempts to help working parents through tax credits may be fuelling the rise in childcare costs unscrupulous nursery owners have been able to hike prices safe in the knowledge that government handouts will soak up the cost for many parents the news comes as tony blairs whitehall troubleshooting unit the performance and innovation unit piu is completing a secret report expected to highlight problems in the governments childcare strategy including growing pressure for a review of how the tax credit works stephen burke of the daycare trust said parents reliant on nurseries to enable them to work had no choice but to pay the going rate parents are trapped there is a real shortage of places so demand is outstripping supply and at the same time there are more and more women in the workforce with young children he said there is some anecdotal evidence even that the childcare tax credit has led to an increase in prices because its just given providers yet more ammunition to put up prices the levels of childcare tax credit were upgraded in the last budget and i think this shows there will need to be further increases but there is a fundamental question about whether that is only helping to stoke the market rather than delivering more childcare the piu report overseen by education minister baroness ashton but heavily influenced by the treasury is expected to back technical changes to make the tax credit easier to claim however it is also expected to highlight fears that the credit is skewing the market for nursery care campaigners now want ministers to switch money into building new nurseries creating competition that drives costs down rather than hoping that giving cash to parents will stimulate demand and encourage more daycare providers to set up in business we should not underestimate the fact that we wont get another chance on this said lisa harker deputy director of another thinktank the institute for public policy research ippr which has led a research project on childcare there are only so many times you can reexamine a strategy and its extremely important not just to consider how we improve the existing system but to look at the year picture browns fondness for tax credits to resolve all problems has already created tensions within the government prompting arguments that too much is spent on a complicated system that many parents do not understand childcare tax credit is paid as part of the working families tax credit claimed by million britons and comes as cash through the pay packet administered by employers it covers up to per cent of the cost of daycare or childminders up to a maximum of for one child and for two children or more it can only be used to pay for

a chronic shortage of childcare is stopping women returning to work after having children according to a new study research by the institute for fiscal studies found that government efforts to try to create more childcare places were failing to close the gap between supply and demand the shortfall worse in britain than any other eu country is compounded by the high cost of existing childcare provision with some mothers spending a quarter of their salary on care about a quarter of nonworking mothers said they would like a regular job but are prevented by high childcare costs or a lack of appropriate provision according to the research one in mothers who work part time say they would work longer hours if suitable childcare was available according to the study there are just eight day nursery places for every children under five and seven places for every children under eight the study mothers employment and childcare use in britain suggests far more parents are relying on informal childcare by relatives friends or neighbours than most previous estimates indicated of preschool children and of school age children the findings confirm widespread concern that government initiatives are failing to provide affordable high quality choices a conference tomorrow organised by the thinktanks genderquake and demos will hear research suggesting that the governments childcare strategy is failing to expand provision fast enough to meet its own target of a million new places by,2002-03,chronic shortage childcare stopping woman returning work child according new study research institute fiscal study found government effort try create childcare place failing close gap supply demand shortfall worse britain eu country compounded high cost existing childcare provision mother spending quarter salary care quarter nonworking mother said would like regular job prevented high childcare cost lack appropriate provision according research one mother work part time say would work longer hour suitable childcare wa available according study eight day nursery place every child five seven place every child eight study mother employment childcare use britain suggests far parent relying informal childcare relative friend neighbour previous estimate indicated preschool child school age child finding confirm widespread concern government initiative failing provide affordable high quality choice conference tomorrow organised thinktanks genderquake demo hear research suggesting government childcare strategy failing expand provision fast enough meet target million new place,"['chronic', 'shortage', 'childcare', 'stopping', 'woman', 'returning', 'work', 'child', 'according', 'new', 'study', 'research', 'institute', 'fiscal', 'study', 'found', 'government', 'effort', 'try', 'create', 'childcare', 'place', 'failing', 'close', 'gap', 'supply', 'demand', 'shortfall', 'worse', 'britain', 'eu', 'country', 'compounded', 'high', 'cost', 'existing', 'childcare', 'provision', 'mother', 'spending', 'quarter', 'salary', 'care', 'quarter', 'nonworking', 'mother', 'said', 'would', 'like', 'regular', 'job', 'prevented', 'high', 'childcare', 'cost', 'lack', 'appropriate', 'provision', 'according', 'research', 'one', 'mother', 'work', 'part', 'time', 'say', 'would', 'work', 'longer', 'hour', 'suitable', 'childcare', 'wa', 'available', 'according', 'study', 'eight', 'day', 'nursery', 'place', 'every', 'child', 'five', 'seven', 'place', 'every', 'child', 'eight', 'study', 'mother', 'employment', 'childcare', 'use', 'britain', 'suggests', 'far', 'parent', 'relying', 'informal', 'childcare', 'relative', 'friend', 'neighbour', 'previous', 'estimate', 'indicated', 'preschool', 'child', 'school', 'age', 'child', 'finding', 'confirm', 'widespread', 'concern', 'government', 'initiative', 'failing', 'provide', 'affordable', 'high', 'quality', 'choice', 'conference', 'tomorrow', 'organised', 'thinktanks', 'genderquake', 'demo', 'hear', 'research', 'suggesting', 'government', 'childcare', 'strategy', 'failing', 'expand', 'provision', 'fast', 'enough', 'meet', 'target', 'million', 'new', 'place']",60
the national childcare strategy has been one of the governments flagship policies but it is failing to deliver change at the pace and scale required why is this a report published by the institute of fiscal studies today helps to explain what has been going wrong the ifs report has two important conclusions having children remains a significant barrier to the employment opportunities of mothers and the lack of accessible and affordable childcare is having an adverse impact on mothers returning to the labour market put more bluntly the current strategy is not working and there is a significant economic cost the figures in the ifs report show strikingly that mothers especially those with younger children are substantially less likely to be in paid employment than women without children the problem is especially acute for single mothers of single mothers do not work and it does not resolve itself when children are old enough to go to school there is no sudden increase in the employment of mothers with schoolage children the childcare gap is a significant constraint on the ability of mothers to return to the labour market about one quarter of nonworking mothers report that they would like to work but are prevented from doing so by having to look after children one in mothers working parttime say that they would increase their hours if affordable and accessible childcare was available partly because of these problems the majority of working families depend on some informal care from family friends and neighbours the government has focused on providing subsidies such as the nursery education grant and the working families tax credit to make childcare more affordable but the ifs research raises questions about this strategy while lower childcare prices were associated with greater use of formal childcare the working families tax credit was found to have a relatively high cost to government and a marginal impact in increasing mothers employment it raised the employment rate by just for single parents and had practically no impact on mothers with partners what then are the implications for government strategy perhaps the most significant is that public resources need to tackle the supply side systematically and aggressively targeting investment at childcare providers as well as providing more effective subsidies for parents that could be done by for example introducing a childcare tax allowance so that childcare costs could be a legitimate expense as well as by reforming the working families tax credit this implies a significant boost to public investment despite an increase in public resources since the state contributes less to childcare provision than almost every major economy while british parents pay the highest childcare costs in europe the childcare sector is ripe for expansion a recent study of nursery provision by market analysts laing buisson put the value of the uk childrens day care nurseries market at just over bn in like the childcare sector in general the childrens nurseries market has grown rapidly in the past years and is now more than five times bigger than at the start of the s as the charts show the vast bulk of this growth is coming from the commercial marketplace and large nursery chains are beginning to take market share from the single nursery providers as investors wake up to the value of childcare as a business if the government focuses public investment on supporting and capitalising childcare entrepreneurs in the notfor profit as well as commercial sector they will accelerate the growth of the sector and tackle supply side problems as more places become available so prices should fall and formal childcare should become more affordable for families subsidies available to parents especially lowerincome ones should continue and be extended but would also benefit from being underpinned by a strategy for tackling the supply side and accelerating the growth of the sector as a whole this cannot be achieved overnight and the government will need to create a framework to develop the industry increase the level of public investment and target it more effectively genderquake and demoss recent report creche barriers recommended the creation of a national childcare development agency with a dedicated childcare fund which would encourage publicprivate partnerships and act as an incubator for new childcare enterprises not for profit as well as commercial as the chart shows there is scope to develop market share among notforprofit childcare enterprises and government could play a leading role in this tax breaks for employers encouraging investment in employee and community childcare provision should also be introduced to engage and involve employers this strategic framework would enable the government to lead by example investing public resources in the marketplace and encouraging venture capitalists and private equity investors and employers to see childcare businesses as socially responsible investments in every crisis there is an opportunity and so it is with childcare the government has a historic opportunity to develop a new and dynamic industry which delivers equality for women meets the needs of todays working families and children and provides employment and socially responsible business opportunities helen

and the lack of accessible and affordable childcare is having an adverse impact on mothers returning to the labour market put more bluntly the current strategy is not working and there is a significant economic cost the figures in the ifs report show strikingly that mothers especially those with younger children are substantially less likely to be in paid employment than women without children the problem is especially acute for single mothers of single mothers do not work and it does not resolve itself when children are old enough to go to school there is no sudden increase in the employment of mothers with schoolage children the childcare gap is a significant constraint on the ability of mothers to return to the labour market about one quarter of nonworking mothers report that they would like to work but are prevented from doing so by having to look after children one in mothers working parttime say that they would increase their hours if affordable and accessible childcare was available partly because of these problems the majority of working families depend on some informal care from family friends and neighbours the government has focused on providing subsidies such as the nursery education grant and the working families tax credit to make childcare more affordable but the ifs research raises questions about this strategy while lower childcare prices were associated with greater use of formal childcare the working families tax credit was found to have a relatively high cost to government and a marginal impact in increasing mothers employment it raised the employment rate by just for single parents and had practically no impact on mothers with partners what then are the implications for government strategy perhaps the most significant is that public resources need to tackle the supply side systematically and aggressively targeting investment at childcare providers as well as providing more effective subsidies for parents that could be done by for example introducing a childcare tax allowance so that childcare costs could be a legitimate expense as well as by reforming the working families tax credit this implies a significant boost to public investment despite an increase in public resources since the state contributes less to childcare provision than almost every major economy while british parents pay the highest childcare costs in europe the childcare sector is ripe for expansion a recent study of nursery provision by market analysts laing buisson put the value of the uk childrens day care nurseries market at just over bn in like the childcare sector in general the childrens nurseries market has grown rapidly in the past years and is now more than five times bigger than at the start of the s as the charts show the vast bulk of this growth is coming from the commercial marketplace and large nursery chains are beginning to take market share from the single nursery providers as investors wake up to the value of childcare as a business if the government focuses public investment on supporting and capitalising childcare entrepreneurs in the notfor profit as well as commercial sector they will accelerate the growth of the sector and tackle supply side problems as more places become available so prices should fall and formal childcare should become more affordable for families subsidies available to parents especially lowerincome ones should continue and be extended but would also benefit from being underpinned by a strategy for tackling the supply side and accelerating the growth of the sector as a whole this cannot be achieved overnight and the government will need to create a framework to develop the industry increase the level of public investment and target it more effectively genderquake and demoss recent report creche barriers recommended the creation of a national childcare development agency with a dedicated childcare fund which would encourage publicprivate partnerships and act as an incubator for new childcare enterprises not for profit as well as commercial as the chart shows there is scope to develop market share among notforprofit childcare enterprises and government could play a leading role in this tax breaks for employers encouraging investment in employee and community childcare provision should also be introduced to engage and involve employers this strategic framework would enable the government to lead by example investing public resources in the marketplace and encouraging venture capitalists and private equity investors and employers to see childcare businesses as socially responsible investments in every crisis there is an opportunity and so it is with childcare the government has a historic opportunity to develop a new and dynamic industry which delivers equality for women meets the needs of todays working families and children and provides employment and socially responsible business opportunities helen

the child support agency established in and about to be overhauled again has become one of the most derided of government agencies in there were reforms that reduced the amount that many absent fathers would have to pay but these were complex and still produced results many claimed were anomalous so the law has been changed again with effect from next month at first only new applications will be affected but existing orders will gradually be brought into line the basic formula will be simple so long as the absent parent earns between and per week after tax national insurance and pension contributions he will have to pay for one child for two and for three or more the other parents income is no longer taken into account but the amount paid is reduced by up to if the paying parent is supporting children in a new relationship anyone whose income is less than per week will only have to pay with a sliding scale where the income is between and income over is disregarded one anomaly that remains is that the parties cannot agree to prevent the csa becoming involved when they settle their finances after divorce not even a court order can have that effect the purpose of the provision may be to prevent overbearing fathers from making mothers agree to too little particularly where the real beneficiary of any child support would be the dss but it causes many uncertainties catherine aherne a barrister specialising in high value divorce settlements explains often the parties and their lawyers have spent a lot of time negotiating a precise settlement that seems fair to everyone this may be fine tuned to produce tax advantages everybody is aware of the orders the csa can make and should take them into account in dividing up the assets and agreeing maintenance if an application is subsequently made to the csa that agreement is distorted and may have to be expensively renegotiated when graham jenkins not his real name divorced his wife cathy in he fell into this trap at the time he was earning as a software engineer and had about saved up however they both felt that grahams income might fall dramatically if the dotcom boom collapsed he agreed to give cathy all but of his savings on the informal understanding she would invest it to produce an income so she would have enough to support the children then aged eight five and three adequately if he did lose his job in exchange she agreed not to seek any further maintenance for herself or the children in fact grahams career has marched on and he now earns around he voluntarily gives cathy per month but knows the csa could order him to pay double that if she applied he says in one sense i couldnt complain if i had to pay more towards my kids but they and cathy are well provided for on the basis of what we agreed and i would feel cheated if she went behind it another criticism of the changes is that if the child stays with the nonresidential parent more than nights a year maintenance will be

grandparents would be paid by the state for time they spent looking after their grandchildren under a radical scheme being considered by ministers to encourage single parents back into the labour market alistair darling the work and pensions secretary is looking at an experiment in nottinghamshire where the county council is paying grandparents aunts and uncles up to per child per week for providing family childcare he is understood to be frustrated by the slow progress made by the department for education and skills in setting up an effective and affordable network of nurseries and childminders officials said mr darling was well aware that the treasury would not countenance funding all grandparents for providing a service that many typically grandmothers were glad to offer for nothing according to research by age concern england one in four uk grandparents look after their grandchildren while parents go out to work providing millions of hours of free childcare but he wants the government to do more to help single parents who say they are unable to embark on a training course or take a job because they cannot find or afford a registered childminder childcare shortages are particularly acute in deprived areas under the working families tax credit parents on low incomes can claim part of the money they spend with a registered childminder but informal arrangements with family members are ineligible his plan was supported by age concern grandparents would welcome any initiative which recognises the vital role they play in childcare a spokeswoman said one million grandparents said their babysitting duties lasted for more than hours a week many said their children would have to give up work without their help she added but the daycare trust the national childcare charity said the government should concentrate on investing in professional childcare services paying grandmothers is at best a short term sticking plaster to mask the failings in current services no other european country sees investing in informal childcare as the way to achieve quality services the trust said nottinghamshire county ouncil said it started years ago to subsidise childcare for parents on benefit or low incomes in poorer parts of the county last year it provided childcare grants to about parents and at least of the money went to close relatives mainly grandmothers trish adams the project manager said the grants helped parents make a reliable commitment to work or training informal childcare arrangements with grandparents trended to break down if the grandparents thought they were helping out as a favour the grant of a week encouraged them to last the course jane wheelock a newcastle university professor who has researched informal family childcare said the government should consider paying pension contributions for grandparents who have given up work to help with childcare there is no doubt that parents consider that grandparents are the next best carers for their children if they are not available more childcare is probably undertaken by grandparents than the formal sector in organisations such as nurseries playschools and kids

the child support agency will descend into chaos and confusion under reforms to child support payments due to come into force next month the government was warned yesterday the wholesale shakeup of the formula for calculating the payments which the government argues will simplify the much criticised existing arrangements and so increase the numbers of parents paying will lead to a two tier system and prompt thousands of appeals the liberal democrats claimed the appeals service serving the csa has acknowledged it expects a significant increase in the number of appeals over child support potentially totalling as many as two million mothers and fathers who have abided by the current arrangements government estimates obtained by the lib dem work and pensions spokesman steve webb show that two thirds of working parents living away from their children usually fathers are expected to pay less under the reforms leaving mothers with less financial support from former partners meanwhile phasing in over around a year of the new maintenance formula would create a system of winners and losers in which fathers in similar circumstances were paying potentially dramatically different sums he said the liberal democrats yesterday renewed calls for the csa to be abolished highlighting further figures showing that the agency delivers on average only maintenance per week per child of which the treasury takes back a third from mothers on benefits the party argues that at an annual cost of m with only half of eligible parents paying the correct amount and over a quarter paying nothing the csa is unable to enforce collection and is unlikely to improve under the new arrangements from april nonresident parents whose income is per week or more will pay of their net income for one child for two children and for three children or more those with an income of less than per week will pay reduced rates of maintenance while those on less than per week net will pay a flat rate of per week a spokeswoman for the department of work and pensions said the changes were aimed at directing more money to children while a disproportionate amount of time had been spent in the past on making the

nannies usually employed to look after children when both parents are at work responsible for fostering a loving and stimulating environment for the kids they also prepare their food and wash their

childcare clubs relied on by working mothers to occupy their youngsters after school hours are under threat of closure according to a new study the survey by kids club network found that twothirds of the clubs which look after thousands of british children from toddlers to teens said their funding was not secure even for the next year almost eight in were worried about their longterm future of those with concerns nearly a quarter said that if things did not improve they might have to close triggering crises for working parents and potentially leaving a flood of older children to entertain themselves on the streets others would raise fees which some parents could not afford or axe places and services the snapshot of clubs represents the early findings of a study of more than centres all in innercity and deprived areas set up under the governments flagship national childcare strategy to help single mothers back to work there are also fears for the future of some private nursery schools used by wealthier parents of preschool children according to the national day nursery association ndna it warned this weekend that government plans for schools to provide childcare facilities after hours could force some of its members out of business what closure means is that parents who are working will have to consider whether they can carry on or will have to make arrangements for their kids which are not what they hoped for said anne longfield of kids club network which represents outofschool clubs outofschool provision was identified by ministers as one of the key gaps meant to be plugged by the government strategy longfield said the crunch would come in the next months as initial lottery funding awarded to set up the clubs runs out leaving fledgling businesses battling to survive on their own most at risk will be those in poorer areas where parents cannot afford to pay high fees privately education ministers are taking the problem seriously in clubs whose lottery

female graduates can expect to earn less than their male counterparts by the time they reach according to new research released today to mark international womens day the report commissioned by the equal opportunities commission showed that on average men in fulltime employment earn more than women even when they have studied the same subjects and achieved the same class of degree julie mellor chairwoman of the eoc today addressed a conference held to mark the launch of both the research and a new advertising campaign to educate women about equal pay if employers want to recruit the brightest and the best in future they are going to have to be able to prove that they provide equal pay students need as much information as possible when they are making decisions about their future if an employer cannot show they take equal pay seriously students might well ask themselves how much they value their staff we know employers dont set out to cheat women most say discrimination is a hidden problem that is precisely why employers need to review their pay systems to make sure they are not shortchanging women she said billboards advertising the new campaign why are women graduates still going cheap were today floated down the thames on a barge to mark international womens day owain james president of the national union of students said it is unbelievable that in the st century women are not paid equally the evidence shows that despite equal and often better academic success the disparity in pay still exists between male and female graduates nearly half of all students said a commitment to equal pay from an employer would influence their choice of job its time to make sure that employers respond to the eoc campaign the report also found the gap between womens and mens average salary gets progressively wider among older graduates kat fletcher nus womens officer said we find that pay inequalities are further exacerbated for women who seek to return to work after raising a family women should not tolerate the gender pay gap which in effect treats them like secondclass citizens a separate report from the transport and workers union also published today showed that british women earn less than women almost anywhere in europe less than men if they are paid hourly and less if paid weekly the good news is that the pay gap was also found to be narrowing it had

decades of equal pay battles have left women earning only an average of of mens earnings the government and other parts of the establishment regularly wring their hands over this unfairness which is caused partly by discrimination within jobs but much more by the fact that women tend to do work that is lowerpaid anyway in the public sector at least the government could try to redress the balance but the subject is rarely discussed in these terms however you choose to look at it female occupations are less well paid than male ones compare for instance the mostly female jobs of secretary hairdresser teacher and speech therapist with the higherpaid more male dominated professions of accountant it specialist and steelworker occupational segregation accounts for the largest part of equal pay differentials says nick page pay specialist at the chartered institute of personnel and development cipd research published by the department for education and employment last may on pay levels among apprentices showed a gender pay gap even for workers aged apprenticeships in engineering and electronics largely held by males were the best paid at an average of a week and respectively women apprentices training in early years childcare and education received and hairdressers got so in engineering and hairdressing the men earned double pay research body incomes data services ids said these findings reinforce the notion that the gender pay gap cannot be tackled effectively without measures aimed at reducing occupational segregation since a disproportionate number of women are still finding work in lowpaid sectors at an early stage we narrowed the issue to two jobs by asking should a police officer be paid more than a nurse the nurses of them female start at salaries behind those of the police who are male the gap widens as their careers progress a strong argument for paying nurses at least as much as the police is that nursing is almost entirely a graduate profession while policing is not only about to of metropolitan police recruits have degrees police officers would argue that their work is more dangerous about of the rank and file officers are attacked each year according to the police federation the royal college of nursing rcn does not have accurate statistics but thinks violence against its members is growing derek ramsay who served in the metropolitan police for four years before becoming a nurse nine years ago says nursing is more dangerous if i was caught in a fight as a police officer i would have top blokes helping me in two minutesin nursing you are alone most hospital security services are useless other arguments however hold more sway shortages of police officers their willingness to threaten action their greater political clout and the reluctance of politicians and unions to address the occupational segregation issue nursing is seen as a vocation but policing is vital to governments which are happy to pay to ensure loyalty during national crises such as strikes that threaten the economy alastair hatchett of ids highlights supply and demand as a basic factor in setting salaries in the case of police officers they have had to pay salaries of that order to attract people in furthermore once they are in the service officers are far more likely than nurses to demand better conditions as they are doing now the police can retire on full pensions at while most nurses must wait a decade longer for less says actuary bryn davies nick page of the cipd says men are more likely to go on strike kick up a fuss and dominate the board ramsay highlights this as the biggest reason nurses dont resist when things happen to them they wont go on strike nursing is not a very united workforce and it is cheaper for politicians to pay more to about police officers than to nurses what is surprising is the unwillingness of the tuc to discuss this apparently for fear of losing friends in one camp or the other and the rcn while urging parity with the police in some of its campaigns is reluctant to comment further a spokeswoman says the police are earning a little bit more we do not comment on what other professions pay you could get into a situation where public sector workers are slagging each other off while the issue is not discussed it may never be resolved the governments women and equality unit does little to highlight the problem despite being committed to reducing the pay gap politicians run a mile from this issue particularly labour ones who fear that in paying police more than nurses they may be seen as keener on the repressive side of government than the caring one if it is genuinely committed to reducing the gender gap however the government must ask itself why the gap is so wide fair equality watchdog finds it impossible to say we asked politicians and leaders of industry should a police officer be paid more than a nurse julie mellor chair of the equal opportunities commission impossible to say the relatively low pay of nurses is indicative of the way this country values what is traditionally seen as womens work other countries value nurses more in australia they earn more than the male average fulltime wage yet here they are paid less however without a full job evaluation to assess the skills and education levels needed it is impossible to compare these two jobs richard towers director of the low pay unit no police officers being paid more than nurses says more about the historical gender divisions in the labour market than about the value of the work such differences will stay until we get rid of artificial divisions in our thinking about jobs and focus on skill risk and value will hutton chief executive industrial society the justification for a woman police officer earning more than a male nurse should rest entirely on how hard it was for her to acquire her skills the difficulty of recruiting and retaining woman officers and the daily demands of her job that she is a woman

parents hit by last weeks national insurance increase can offset the worst effects of chancellor gordon browns second income tax if they replace a portion of their salary with childcare vouchers the littleknown vouchers can be used to pay for care provided by childminders nurseries play groups after school and holiday clubs nannies and even close blood relatives say experts who believe many working parents are missing out the savings are down to the fact that childcare vouchers currently offered by around employers in the uk fewer than do not attract ni so if you elect to substitute a childcare voucher for part of your gross salary you can save the ni normally deducted from that portion and get more money in your takehome pay your employer also benefits by saving on the employer ni contributions due on that portion these savings can be used to offset the costs of running the scheme so everybody is happy its a real winwin situation says claire spottiswoode chairman of one childcare voucher provider busy bees which provides vouchers to more than employers including many in the public sector it has just added supermarket chain asda to its client list the potential savings for both employees and employ ers who take part in a salary conversion childcare voucher scheme will be even greater from april when the ni increases announced in last weeks budget come into effect ms spottiswoode says the fact that childcare vouchers do not attract ni makes them really significant but underpublicised way for a lot of people and businesses to save money on childcare costs the potential for others to gain from this fantastic recruitment and retention benefit is enormous at present employees pay ni on annual earnings between and the upper earnings level uel or if they belong to a company pension scheme that is contracted out of serps employers pay or if they run a contractedout pension scheme on all an employees salary over from april employees face a rise in their ni to on annual earnings between and and for the first time on all earnings above that amount employers ni rates also go up by so under current ni rates someone earning and paying a month for childcare for example could save up to a year in ni by taking part in such a salary conversion childcare voucher scheme the same person could save up to in the tax year at present higher paid employees who earn more than the current uel make no savings by opting to take childcare vouchers in place of a portion of salary but next year when theyll have to pay the new ni rate on everything they earn above they stand to make at least a saving it should be made clear that having a deduction from your salary for childcare vouchers does not affect the amount of income tax you pay while vouchers dont attract ni they are taxable in the same way that earnings are employees who earn less than and dont pay class ni do not benefit from taking part in a childcare voucher scheme and the selfemployed cannot take part while childcare voucher schemes have received little publicity in the past next years promised rise in ni rates has prompted many more employers to investigate the possibility of setting up schemes anne ross national sales manager for accor services the largest provider of childcare vouchers with clients including the bank of scotland the royal bank of scotland and nationwide says our childcare vouchers business is buzzing at the moment we are inundated with enquiries from employers busy bees managing director john woodward says it is a puzzle why more employers arent already taking advantage of childcare voucher schemes he dismisses claims from some critics who say employers are put off setting up schemes because the commission charged on vouchers by providers cancels out any ni savings for employers our commission varies slightly from employer to employer depending on volume he says we charge to a typical health trust for example but the most we charge an employer is so they are still making a saving and our charges wont go up next year when the potential ni savings increase mr woodward says i think the main obstacle is apathy and a certain amount of ignorance on the part of employers i suggest working parents whose employers dont yet offer a scheme ask them why not as sweet as honey thanks to busy bees amanda spink a project manager from nottingham has been taking advantage of the salary conversion childcare voucher scheme offered by her employer boots for the past year her twoandahalfyearold daughter anna attends a private daycare nursery in nottingham four days a week at a cost of a month while ms spink works at the boots head office ms spink who earns takes the whole out of her salary as childcare vouchers i fill in a form each month saying that i want one voucher for made out to the nursery and post it off in a prepaid envelope to busy bees who provide the vouchers for the scheme she explains i do it separately each month because this allows me to alter the amount if for example i take anna to a play group session on my day off i can add that cost and request another voucher to pay the playgroup any childcare provider i use who receives the vouchers has to be registered with busy bees when i receive the vouchers i hand them over to the carers who then reclaim the money from busy bees and the amount shows up on my payslip as a deduction from my gross salary the ni saving on would be each month but for me is actually because im in the company pension scheme im really pleased with the benefits the scheme offers to come back to work after anna was born meant paying out a huge nursery bill so any help i get with it is very welcome and from next april when ni rates go up the saving will be more which makes joining the scheme even more worthwhile,2002-04,parent hit last week national insurance increase offset worst effect chancellor gordon brown second income tax replace portion

a squad of barristers specialising in rape prosecutions is to be set up after an inquiry revealed that fewer than one in cases resulted in conviction harriet harman the solicitor general told the commons yesterday we must ensure that women can have confidence that the criminal justice system will take rape allegations seriously and prosecute them effectively and that offenders and potential offenders must know that they cant get away with it ms harman also suggested that a large rise in the numbers of female barristers and senior judges was needed to improve womens confidence in the system the report by the inspectorate of constabulary and the crown prosecution service inspectorate found that of cases examined attackers were charged or cautioned in just from a snapshot of cases referred to the crown prosecution service went to court and seven out of defendants who denied the charges were acquitted it found serious failings in the way victims were treated at every stage of the criminal justice process ms harman told vera baird labour mp for redcar who accused the judiciary of outdated views that the lord chancellor was aware of the need to involve judges in discussions but it was also important to appoint more female judges she said i think its unlikely that women victims alleging rape will have confidence in a criminal justice system where the barristers are nearly all men and nearly all the judges in the higher courts are men she added what is sad is that there is clear evidence of underreporting because many women think that the man is just going to get away with it because the criminal justice system wont take it seriously there will also be efforts to improve the handling of cases with sessions being held after both successful and unsuccessful cases to discover what lessons can be learned from them the liberal democrat spokesman john burnett asked whether the government would change rules on the disclosure of previous convictions in sex cases ms harman told him that this was part of a separate review of the criminal justice system by lord justice auld and the governments decision would be included in its response to his report a source said that the crown prosecution service had a number of very able women prosecutors who had been driven out of private practice by the long hours culture and who would form the nucleus of the proposed new team of experts ms harman also promised action on domestic violence so that more reported cases come to court,2002-04,squad barrister specialising rape prosecution set inquiry revealed fewer one case

what job did you want to do when you were chances are unless you were one of the focused few who knew their working destiny from an early age you wouldnt have had much of a clue mostly this is because children are not sufficiently exposed to the world of work to know what is available research by the guide association has found that girls in particular still have a shockingly narrow perception of the opportunities available two in three still aspire to the traditional female jobs such as teaching childcare and nursing this is what take our daughters to work day aims to change operated on a small scale in this country since by a pair of volunteers the scheme has just been taken over by the guide association although relatively lowprofile in this country the scheme is well known in the us where it is estimated that m girls and parents take part each year the day has featured in the plot of hit animated film monsters inc as well as in er and spin city on this years day in the uk thursday well over girls between and are expected to troop into the offices of their parents to discover exactly what mum or dad does all day organisations as diverse as the crown prosecution service intel the immigration department and a quarry in the midlands are all gearing up to show schoolgirls what the world of work is really like engineering companies are being especially encouraged to allow their employees daughters to come in as the figures for girls entering this profession are still low even after years of promotion there has been a increase in the proportion of women in this sector since but they still only make up of the total engineering workers this is all about opening girls eyes to what is out there for them says susan kaywilliams head of marketing at the guide association the day is an excellent opportunity for companies to shatter preconceptions and demonstrate the diversity of career opportunities open to young women by gaining an insight at a young age into what is available we hope girls will be inspired to broaden their aspirations gloucester sixthformer nikki hollett had thought her dad went to work at am came home at pm and regularly took holidays in hot countries after spending the day shadowing her father and others at his incentive travel company carlton atlantic travel and events she realised the reality was different i learned how hard he and his team work but also saw the relationships he has built with clients and the satisfaction of completing an event hollett now plans to take a degree in international hospitality management sometimes the day gives a more practical introduction to work everyone was so smart even the receptionists wore suits says joanne austin who spent a day at her fathers employer barclays two years ago of course bringing your daughters to work doesnt just mean driving them in and leaving them in a corner of the office with a magazine kaywilliams says girls get the best out of the day if the they can move around talking to colleagues about their jobs after all no one wants their daughter to come home and say is that all you do companies including merrill lynch and barclays have taken part for years the former has arranged its own programmes for the girls involving workshops and talks from famous role models lucinda horn vicepresident of employee communications at merrill lynch supervises the companys scheme she says they have found it makes sense to create a structured programme we used to arrange activities for the morning and then let them spend the afternoons with their parents but we realised this was too long so we now send them back to their parents just for the final hourandahalf of the afternoon girls are then encouraged to help out with basic tasks such as answering the phone or photocopying a lot depends on what the parents job is says horn theres not much that a daughter is going to be able to do if her parent is say a derivatives trader but she would still benefit from the buzz of the trading room keeping the girls under adequate supervision is a key element of bringing your daughter into work this is why many companies operating the scheme organise group activities for the girls appointing a guardian for the day keeping them in one place might have avoided the nightmare scenario described by journalist toby young in his book how to lose friends and alienate people he had arranged a stripper to come into the new york offices of magazine publisher cond nast on take our daughters to work day and had to fend off a succession of girls tapping on the door wanting to know what was going on inside but assuming youve hidden away any embarrassing facets of office life you may want to put that pirelli calendar in a drawer hosting your daughter for the day should arm her with an understanding of the nature of work of course she may also discover the embarrassing nickname your colleagues reserve for you and the amount of internet surfing you indulge in during the mid afternoon lull make friends and get involved you should make friends with the other girls straight away advises adele chapman who took part in merrill lynchs take our daughters to work day last year some of the girls just sat there and didnt take part they cant have got much out of it adele a pupil at bullers wood school in chislehurst kent was part of a group of girls split into groups of colour coded to avoid losing children an icebreaker game at the start of the day was followed by visits to advertising it and trading with various workshop activities arranged to give the girls a flavour of the job they also listened to talks from blue peter presenter konnie huq on how tv work is tough to break into and a representative from house of colour who advised the girls on dress and makeup for work id had a rough idea of what happened where my mum works but that day taught me a lot says adele when we were in the trading room we played a game using cards with pictures of animals that were changing value and had to decide whether to sell or keep them that made the whole idea of trading much clearer adele dreams of being an actress but having listened to huq warn of the practical obstacles to getting into the business she is considering a more reliable backup career im aiming to be a lawyer ive watched investigative tv programmes like kavanagh qc and it seems an interesting job the day gave me confidence kate scott now spent a day shadowing a family friend at norwich solicitor mills amp reeves when she was she already had more than a passing interest in the law her father is a solicitor and the day gave her more confidence she is now studying law at cambridge and hopes to specialise in international law kate spent the day observing tax and probate work the solicitor showed her how to draw up a will and she sat in on a meeting with a client it was interesting she recalls it shows you that whatever you think of a career there is always quite a bit of paperwork it also made me realise that law requires logical thinking and research and then working out how to put something to a client in a simple explainable

it has been the cause of countless arguments across the land and now the truth is finally out women do spend inordinate amounts of time getting ready to go out whether to the office the nightclub or even the shops new research shows it is impossible for a woman to take less than minutes to leave the house regardless of where she is going a survey of women by marks amp spencer has found that the average woman takes the equivalent of working days a year getting ready for work although that is down by two full days on a decade ago it still accounts for minutes a day and per cent of women admit to taking more than an hour the gender revolution has received a great deal of attention in the past few years with women reaching several important milestones in terms of their economic educational and professional power said william nelson an analyst at the future foundation which undertook the research but this shows that despite all their other accomplishments women are still acutely concerned that they will be judged on their appearance the majority of women take minutes and per cent spend over an hour getting ready for a shopping trip the anxiety grows as night draws nearer with the average woman spending minutes preparing for a night out with the girls while a romantic evening demands minutes of care and attention one of the most surprising findings of the research was that women care more about what their female colleagues are thinking and saying about them than their male colleagues scott said while nine out of women claimed their own opinion was most important to them when it came to their appearance at work per cent said the opinion of their female colleagues was most important compared with per cent who gave a fig what men in their office thought this finding certainly suggests women tend to be more conscious of the social rather than sexual implications of their appearance in the workplace scott saidbut when you look around you at the appearance of both

applause from the labour benches during gordon browns budget speech was prompted not only by the huge investment in health but also by more money for childcare a decade ago even a mention of the cword would have been unthinkable in a chancellor in five years labour has travelled far in putting childcare on the public agenda working parents on lower incomes now get help towards childcare costs new nurseries are to open in deprived areas and a national target of a million new childcare places by has been set the budget extended eligibility for childcare credits to families employing registered childminders in their own homes and to families on higher incomes childcare is now undeniably in the public domain the problem is that responsibility for finding and funding that care remains primarily within the private sphere the government will give you money to help subsidise your childcare but supply has failed to grow to meet parents needs last year there was only one childcare place for every seven children under eight and the government looks unlikely to hit its goal of one million new places whether you can find care for your baby still depends on where you live and how much money you have a nursery place costs on average a week and even those entitled to the maximum childcare credit must still pay of costs ironically in the light of mr browns keenness to see mothers return to work the expense and shortage of childcare is a barrier to womens employment even where the government has provided startup money to create new nursery places in deprived areas it involves a complex web of grants with none guaranteed for more than three years the market has not provided the answer to the uks depressing combination of scarce and costly childcare campaigners agree that without a core of sustained public funding universal childcare will never happen the state need not provide the care it could be the voluntary or private sector but money is needed for startup costs

any working parent who has had a child in the past years will know that precious darling has acquired an all too literal meaning north or south a baby in a nursery can cost in the region of a year and rising in childcare was recognised by gordon brown as the key to a prospering modern economy releasing female talent and creating a route out of poverty five years on it is ironic that its now becoming a fast route to penury only of parents with dependent children can afford to use formal childcare services all the time afford meaning for many on an average salary squeezing tight on everything else and forgetting about a pension we have much to thank this government for it has gone further than any before in recognising that if parents are in the workforce someone else has to be paid to rock the cradle who minds the baby has at last moved into the public domain thanks are due too for the introduction of the working family tax credit for the new nurseries and for the bn promised in future investment but no thanks at all for the marketdriven mess that is now emerging ten years ago a nursery place could be had for a week now fees range from to a week the market is worth bn a year and local authority provision has shrunk to only of the total michael thompson heads childbase a company set up years ago that now runs nurseries with an annual turnover of over m sixty per cent of costs relate to wages he points out and its right that they should rise from the shamefully low rates that apply in much of the industry but that will mean everescalating fees childcare is tomorrows klondike but where does that leave the poor the averageincome earners on plus and that new breed the affluently broke the system is too expensive it is inadequate there was one childcare place for every seven children under eight in and it is badly targeted nurseries in deprived areas are welcome but as academics have pointed out there are more poor people scattered throughout britains affluent areas than there are concentrated in areas of obvious deprivation subsidies such as they are are linked to a parent in employment coming through the wage packet and penalising the child in a nowork household where the government gives no help at all while available choices mean that too many children are experiencing a patchwork of inconsistent care how to make a real difference of course employers in the uk who fork out miserably little should be pushed to contribute more but what is really required is the one radical measure that mr brown is unlikely to deliver in next weeks budget not just more government investment as helen wilkinson recently argued on these pages but the provision in the long term of free universal childcare it may sound absurd but once upon a time so did free universal education until the age of we need a fresh strategy in which government pays the cost of nurseries or childminders and the private sector meets the demand contracting to provide quality care raising wages and thus ensuring that the dangerous lack of qualified staff is corrected we could even grow really bold and opt for that original s feminist demand of hour nurseries not to incubate your offspring round the clock but to provide for the flexible working life which includes night shifts and dawn starts critics will no doubt immediately protest against the taxpayer meeting the childcare bills of those who can afford to pay their own but that is precisely the point most parents are struggling financially with many relinquishing careers because it is cheaper to stay at home precisely the opposite effect to that which brown intended raise taxes on the higher earners who will probably opt to stay in the gucci zone of nannies on salaries of a year and liberate the rest of parents at present living on their nerves and overdrafts when you think of the longterm savings free childcare doesnt seem nearly so scary in their

only one in women reporting a rape will see their assailant convicted according to figures today from the first british study to look at the investigation and prosecution of rape from start to finish the report produced jointly by the inspectorates for the police and the crown prosecution services finds failures throughout the system and calls for a package of measures to bring more rapists to justice among key recommendations are more sensitive treatment of rape complainants to increase their confidence in the system and specialist teams of prosecutors to handle rape cases the report found that of cases reported to police ended up with a conviction the findings confirm home office statistics showing that the rate of conviction for rape has fallen from of reported cases in to in the study of police forces and cps areas found that only of cases reported to police resulted in criminal proceedings or caution and only of the cases referred to the cps reached court where cases reached court the conviction rate including guilty pleas was but seven out of defendants who pleaded not guilty were acquitted in a quarter of cases the complainant withdrew the allegation the report highlights a catalogue of serious failings in the way victims are treated at every step of the criminal justice system its not perfect at any stage of the process it all needs tightening up and sharpening said the inspector of constabulary david blakey who called for a major cultural shift key findings include the sensitive treatment of victims is key to the prospects of securing a conviction better training and guidance are needed for police forensic medical examiners and prosecutors all allegations of rape should be reviewed by prosecutors with specialist training in the handling of sexual offences major review decisions by cps lawyers such as dropping a case or reducing a charge should be discussed with another specialist lawyer to make sure cases are pre sented in the best possible way there should be early meetings between prosecuting counsel and the cps team and the same counsel should deal with the case throughout prosecuting counsel should be more robust to ensure victims are not forced to endure inappropriate questioning in court stephen wooler chief inspector at the cps inspectorate said what we see is the potential for a lot of improvement across the whole process taken collectively these recommendations have the potential to make the pro portion of successful outcomes significantly higher he said the figures were quite disturbing in relation to what is such an awful crime there being few crimes which have such a lasting effect on their victims a crucial element in improving the success rate was making sure victims were well supported from the beginning so they have the courage to go through what they perceive as a substantial ordeal he said probably the biggest single factor is ensuring victims have confidence in the system at all stages a high number of com plaints are subsequently withdrawn by the victim particularly where the victim is known to the assailant factors thought to contribute to the fall in conviction rates include the decreasing proportion of stranger rapes and the increase in cases where defendant and complainant know each other these cases often raise difficult issues of consent another factor is the rise in cases involving drugs or alcohol the report says in themselves the numbers appear shocking the steps we have outlined will we hope have a cumulative effect upon improving the quality of the evidence and presentation in court the impact of this should be to reduce the attrition rate at each stage a spokeswoman for the rape crisis federation said many of these points about treatment of victims and the failures of the criminal justice system are what we have been saying for years we particularly welcome the recommendation for specialist lawyers which led to a conviction rate when introduced in new york,2002-04,one woman reporting rape see assailant convicted according figure today first british study look investigation prosecution rape start finish report produced jointly

teams of specialist rape prosecutors could be set up after an official report confirmed that fewer than one in allegations of rape result in a conviction an inquiry by the crown prosecution service inspectorate which monitors the work of the cps found criminal proceedings were launched in only of cases where an allegation was made to police only of trials ended in a conviction the report carried out jointly with the inspectorate of constabulary is to be published next week it will identify several reasons for these figures including the difficulties of proving lack of consent in date rape cases it will recommend that every cps office or region has access to a prosecutor with specialist knowledge of rape cases not every case would have to be prosecuted by an expert an increase in the number of prosecutions where the accused and the complainant know each other has been linked to the fall in convictions in of rape allegations ended in convictions since then the proportion of all recorded cases categorised as stranger rapes has fallen from to and there has been an increased proportion of allegations of acquaintance rape the report is expected to call for improved training of police when questioning rape complainants and improved training of police forensic medical examiners crown prosecutors will be expected to raise standards of presentation in court making sure that the complainant is treated more sensitively and is better informed about what is happening in court sandra mcneill a spokeswoman for the rape crisis federation in england and wales said rape cases should not just be given out at random the defence have specialists in rape cases and its time the prosecution did complainants say to us that they would welcome the chance to meet the prosecutor beforehand

to set the prosecution the lower test of proving that the victim had not given their voluntary and genuine agreement rather than having to prove the victim did not consent the law will list examples

doctor dna was taken from me and i gave a statement they found him after a fortnight by running his dna through the computer in his first interview he denied he knew me in the second the police presented him with the dna finding and he made a confession in front of his solicitor hed also been examined before his interviews by a doctor who said he was capable of being questioned when it came to the crown court there was suddenly two days of legal argument at the last minute his defence argued he had a low verbal iq of making him on the borderline of being mentally handicapped because there was not an appropriate adult present when he made his confession they argued the evidence wasnt admissible and the judge said he had no option but to acquit i was absolutely gutted i had a fit and began gulping for air while the barrister from the cps said he wanted to explain it to me and then talked to my sister about it over my head all along the police had told me it was as cut and dried as it could possibly be but when they threw out his confession it was just my word against his the injustice of this was worse than the actual minutes when the rape took place one thing that would increase the rate of conviction would be for people to start believing women because of them cant be lying can they i know because im one of them,2002-04,kirsten summer mother castleford west

at dame julia higgins has almost as many letters after her name as in it based at imperial college london as professor of polymer science she is also the president of the institution of chemical engineers as well as her numerous responsibilities she is desperately trying to promote chemical engineering particularly to women through her work with the government body the athena project she is also a trustee of the daphne jackson trust which helps engineers and scientists return to work after career breaks higgins admits that she got into engineering by accident had anyone mentioned engineering to me at school which they certainly didnt years ago i might possibly have studied it but it wasnt an option then higgins went to an allgirls grammar school in southwest london her physics teacher is the only role model she can recall she was so charismatic a brilliant teacher higgins studied physics at oxford university in the early s at a time when only five of its colleges accepted women of the women at somerville college only were doing physics it was a chemistry professor there who made her switch to chemical engineering he was looking for a physicist to do some research he wanted to use the elementary particle the neutron to study the structure of materials he thought chemists might be a bit nervous about doing something like that physicists at least knew what a neutron was thats how i moved into the chemistry side of things higgins stayed to do her phd and then taught for several years but she longed to move back into research by a number of coincidences she ended up with a fellowship at manchester university where she became a specialist on the subject of polymers which in essence are plastics can plastic really be a subject to get excited about polymers were only really understood properly about years ago they are made up of extremely long molecules when i start thinking about them i find them absolutely fascinating how do you make them how do you make them stretch most of the clothes you are wearing are probably made from synthetic polymer fibres higgins is well aware that engineering is not perceived as a sexy subject and that as a result young students are shying away from it the number of people going into engineering is dropping by every year and i think the country should be really worried the problem surrounding recruitment into engineering is a complex one exacerbated by ignorance ask the average person what they think an engineer does and theyll be stuck for a response those who do suggest an answer are often way off the mark in this country people think an engineer is the person who comes to mend the sink or the person who drives the train engineering has a completely different image in places such as france and germany where they are regarded as highly qualified technical people so what exactly do engineers do simplistically put you might say that a scientist asks the question why and an engineer asks the question how she says people dont think food petrol or pharmaceuticals involve lots of chemical engineers if you buy a jar of jam its not made by some little old lady stirring a pot its made at a chemical plant chemical engineers are involved in the process but we seem to be a bit invisible within that attracting new talent is proving difficult higgins believes that children are having to choose subjects far too early if i had a magic wand id make them choose their subjects later the sciences are perceived to be harder than the arts and suffer from poor image we need scientists and engineers to have more dialogue with children in schools showing them that it is an exciting field to enter it isnt about scientists being locked away alone it involves group work it is about problemsolving and it is extremely satisfying women who choose science and then fail to see females working in university departments are unlikely to choose it as a career path says higgins also if you drop out of research for any length of time its almost impossible to get back because things move on so fast women see that and dont consider it as a career compatible with having a family those who do stay are women like me who are madly keen but a job in university should be flexible enough to allow for a career break just like in the rest of industry global companies she says will always find ways to recruit new talent and if they fail to find it in the uk they will move their businesses elsewhere its a hugely important issue we have to find a way of encouraging children otherwise we are not going to have people educated enough to be able to take advantage of new technology and we are not going to have an educated electorate who understand what is being done in their name in technology she concludes,2002-05,dame julia higgins ha almost many letter name based imperial college london professor polymer science also president institution chemical engineer well numerous

many moons ago when the old boy network dominated the workplace replacing a pompous pinstriped male boss with an empathic and understanding female one would have merely been a pipe dream but years on as women are steadily filling senior management positions and exuding positive professional qualities statistics appear to suggest that many of us would prefer to work for a man in a report produced for the chartered institute of management cim by online recruiters gojobsitecouk of the women surveyed say they would rather be managed by a man while only feel women make better bosses but the bosss gender was irrelevant to most of the women and men surveyed nearly half of women and of men didnt state a preference one woman who certainly does have a preference is danielle hine a pa for a womens glossy magazine give me a female boss any day she says ive worked for male bosses in the past both in australia and london and found them really arrogant we didnt get along very well because im just not the type of girl who would giggle at their silly jokes or pander to their egos in my experience female bosses tend to be much more willing to give their staff extra responsibility and encouragement because they understand the glass ceiling thing and are more likely to push you forward than a male boss so can we believe surveys when they say that we would rather work for a male manager cary cooper professor of organisational psychology at the university of manchesters institute of science and technology thinks not he discounts such results and supports the argument that women make better managers its true that those first women who pushed through the glass ceiling had quite a harsh approach a sort of queen bee attitude but the next generation didnt bother accommodating the male way and allowed their own natural management style to shine through women are often wrongly criticised for being emotionally imbalanced and therefore incapable of having senior management roles men lose their rag at work too they get angry and aggressive and often resort to bullying tactics but due to the experience women have in organising their social or family lives they are so much more adept at being able to hold down a highflying career and deal with the domestic side of life he says the other advantage is that women are sensitive to employees needs which is especially helpful in dealing with workplace change the more women there are handling it the better adds professor cooper furthermore figures earlier this year in the journal people management reveal that feminine management skills are considered more effective than masculine ones john albanmetcalfe is a lecturer in psychology and beverly alimometcalfe is professor of leadership studies both at the university of leeds as part of their research into leadership they asked managers in both the public and private sector to assess a current or previous boss and then identify their sex although the results show that qualities such as vision charisma and inspiration are crucial to leaders at the top the qualities staff value and appreciate in the managers they work with on a close or daily basis are often very different the key attributes are genuine concern for others humour integrity motivating people and responding sensitively to signs of stress and in this study women scored far higher than men but leadership is not about being a wonderman or woman it is about being a decent human being who truly values the individuality of staff and who removes barriers between individuals teams functions and other organisations to work towards the achievement of a joint vision says professor alimometcalfe rather than having a heroic masculine leader our study proved that staff value a caring and encouraging one who helps them to think laterally and motivates them she says that said a lot depends on the individual there are plenty of sensi tive male bosses around just as there are tyrannical female ones there are also people for whom a female boss is their worst nightmare this is the case for jane thomas a secretarial temp in london thomas specifically requests her agency to put her forward for jobs where she will be working for a man because she has experienced too many irrational and difficult women in the workplace one particular female boss used to slam doors and make snide and nasty comments if i so much as said good morning to her she says another would throw dictaphone tapes at me i prefer working for a male boss because i like a direct and cleancut working approach and there arent any feelings of competitiveness but it has to be said that such behaviour could come from either gender perhaps we havent become used to working for women yet and this may be true in some sectors more than others says jackie jones human resources director at gojobsite and she adds women may prefer a male boss because he is less likely to ask personal questions petra cook is head of policy at the chartered institute of management she says that women in management roles simply dont have the time to be nosy and are far more concerned with doing their jobs than finding out every last piece of information about their employees but in any case forming close working relationships with staff is good because it ensures that subordinates are known as people rather than numbers richard tidsall a marketing consultant from richmond has a balanced view towards the boss gender debate i respect people with business flair regardless of whether theyre male or female id probably feel more able to turn to a female boss with a personal issue as they are more understanding and sympathetic but on the other hand a male boss has the ability to be more impartial toni henvest a pa who works for a london law firm agrees she has worked for both good and bad male and female bosses but believes there is nothing worse than a woman trying desperately to make an impression in her efforts to get to the top consequently the higher up the female boss is the better they are to work for she says getting to know and understand how your boss ticks is the main hurdle once youve cleared that youve cracked it but trying to find clearcut boundaries between men and women as managers becomes irrelevant when you consider the fact that any healthy workplace needs both women are generally more empowering than men and good at teambuilding and communicating but traditional skills such as strategic ones which are typically male are equally important says karen dale at

men who rape their wives or girlfriends should be sentenced just as harshly as those who rape strangers the official body which advises judges on sentencing said yesterday the sentencing advisory panel said judges seemed to have been passing lesser sentences where the rapist and his victim were known to each other although this was not a mitigating factor under current rape guidelines which date back to the panel mainly academics judges and magistrates was set up four years ago to provide independent advice to the appeal court judges on the guidelines they should issue to judges in the lower courts to ensure consistency the panels chairman professor martin wasik said sentencing practice does appear to be more lenient when the victim and offender were known to each other it seemed clear to us from the outset that the relevance if any of a relationship between victim and offender was a factor that could not simply be ignored in new sentencing guidelines for rape a research report commissioned by the panel showed that rape was always seen as a very serious crime and that the impact on the victim was as great regardless of the individuals relationship with the rapist our advice to the court of appeal is that new guidelines should include a clear statement that relationship rape and acquaintance rape are to be treated by sentencers as being no less serious than

women assaulted by their partners could be granted a right of anonymity in court similar to the protection given to rape victims under a government crackdown on domestic violence the step intended to encourage more women to press charges amid significant underreporting of domestic violence is being considered by ministers together with plans for tougher sentencing and new criminal offences the solicitor general harriet harman unveiling plans for legislation and proposals for a review of the way courts and other agencies deal with domestic violence yesterday promised a culture change in which any lingering acceptability of domestic violence would be banished between a quarter and a third of murders of women are committed by present or expartners and domestic violence accounts for almost a quarter of violent crime the proposals announced yesterday at a conference of prosecutors in london represent an attempt by ms harman a former minister for women to kickstart the governments stalled drive to tackle domestic violence introduced three years ago the minister has already intervened successfully over an excessively lenient sentence for domestic assault and promised to continue to exercise her powers of appeal among the expected new measures are the introduction of restraining orders which courts could impose during sentencing to ensure violent men stayed away from their partners either in addition to or in place of a custodial sentence campaigners warn that abusers jailed for assault frequently return to harass their partners after leaving prison ms harman also wants to see a new criminal offence of breaching a nonmolestation order the orders granted by civil courts to stop an abusive expartner harassing a woman such an offence already exists in northern ireland the extension of the right to anonymity is also under consideration though is expected to prove more controversial ms harman backs the idea arguing that women frequently refuse to go through a criminal trial for fear of exposure of their children the move would inevitably also ensure the anonymity of the male partner in court but the solicitor general believes women are less interested in public shame of a violent husband than in justice and in their immediate safety the womens aid federation the domestic violence campaign group yesterday welcomed the package of announcements but cautioned that moves to grant anonymity to women victims should be addressed carefully in order to ensure they were not prevented from seeking help if the legal process failed them since her appointment a year ago ms harman has made clear her determination to address domestic violence abuse by partners happened at all levels in society she added the case referred to the appeal court by ms harman which saw a noncustodial sentence increased to a sixmonth jail term concerned a university professor who had broken his wifes ribs punctured her lungs sexually assaulted her and threatened to kill her its not men burgling to feed their crack habit ms harman said domestic violence happens in all walks of life we must target those people who think they can be criminals at home and get away with it the conference is also discussing pilot schemes being run by the crown prosecution service and metropolitan police to develop murder reviews following domestic killings in the reviews similar to inquiries carried out after child murders all agencies which have come into contact with the family will share notes in an attempt to find out how procedures can be improved to prevent further

an overhaul of britains laws on sex crimes that is expected to sweep away the remaining victorian bans on gay sex and reform the law on rape will be introduced into parliament this autumn the home secretary david blunkett said yesterday we will legislate in the next session of parliament on sex offences and sex offenders sex offences in terms of the th century laws and definitions which have been consulted on in the last two years and sex offenders in terms of updating our laws to take account of the most horrendous events that have been in the headlines in this country the package is expected to include a new crime of adult sexual activity with a child the first of its kind anywhere in the world which will spell out that some cases of child abuse and paedophilia are so serious that they will in future carry a life sentence home office ministers also want to use a sexual offences bill to strengthen the law on rape to tackle the appallingly low conviction rate it will cover issues such as a new definition of consent but will not create a lesser offence of date rape which ministers say is just as traumatic as being raped by a stranger the definition of rape is expected to be extended to include oral penetration mr blunkett said yesterday that he was in the process of finalising proposals to update the centuries old outdated law on sex offences we are balancing here the toughening of protection particularly for children while ensuring the law is fair and nondiscriminatory and reflects the st rather than the th century view of social policy a government white paper setting out mr blunketts proposals is to be published this autumn based on the home office review setting the boundaries which was produced in and has attracted more than responses it will also include proposals to tighten the way the sex offenders register works setting the boundaries advocated sweeping away the remaining victorian offences of gross indecency buggery and soliciting by men which is sometimes called cottaging its author betty moxon argued that the assumption in the original criminal law amendment act that such gay sex acts by consenting adults in private were unnatural legitimised prejudice and contributed to homophobia oscar wilde was jailed under this law the review said that the law which had been used against thousands of men for cottaging or cruising should be scrapped arguing that similar behaviour between men and women would be seen as no more than chatting up the overhaul of the sex crime laws will also include legislation to ensure that incest covers stepparents and keeps pace with the changing nature of the family a new crime of adult sexual activity with a child would replace seven different offences which are currently used to prosecute in child abuse cases which carry different age limits and penalties it is also expected to include heavy penalties for those who engage in the commercial sexual exploitation of children simon hughes the liberal democrats home office spokesman welcomed the decision to bring forward wholesale reform partial reform will not be sufficient and it is right that the government wishes to take more time and

mothers using childminders are more confident about the quality of care being provided than those leaving a child with a grandmother nanny or nursery according to a report today from penelope leach a childcare specialist giving the first results of a five year survey of families she said they cast doubt on the governments determination to promote nurseries at the expense of childminders the survey asked mothers when their babies were three months old what they thought would be the ideal childcare if money were no object nearly half said they wanted to stay at home and care for the child full time grandparents nannies and nurseries were the most popular alternatives with only mentioning a childminder and suggesting the childs father when the mothers were reinterviewed nine months later half were at home caring for the child full time but childminding had become the preferred alternative a childminder was chosen by of mothers compared with opting for grandparents using a nursery and a nanny in of families the father was the main carer the researchers found that of mothers using childminders said their relationship was very good compared with using grandparents using nannies and using a nursery grandparents were the most likely to be close and loving but they were also more inclined to tell the mother when the child had been unhappy in a way that made her feel guilty childminders scored more highly than nurseries and nannies for being close and loving the mothers also found them more welcoming ms leach president of the national child minding association will present her findings at a conference at the royal college of physicians in london today she said our early inquiries into what families want and need call into question some outdated assumptions about

does parental leave for men work a survey conducted by the chartered institute for personnel and development cipd shows encouraging signs it claims that takeup of paternity leave has jumped from to over the past three years when the statistics are cleaned and filleted however the message is rather more mixed although a substantial minority of firms claim that more than of their male employees took leave for family reasons the largest group was made up of firms where or less of men took family leave these figures may be as good as it ever gets in norway which has the best arrangements for paternity leave anywhere in the world only a quarter of fathers take up the option the apparent surge in the uk is no doubt due to the fact that a modest amount of paternity leave became a statutory right in at the time peter mandelson who was in charge of the legislation claimed that such leave was already established in many british firms he was exaggerating but only slightly the fact is that leave provisions by employers and by law is still running ahead of demand this will come as a disappointment to pressure groups that campaign for working mothers they look to men to change the workplace culture a further disappointment is that the same cipd survey shows that employers assistance with childcare in the form of workplace creches or contributions towards childminding has fallen away since this is in spite of the introduction a couple of years ago of tax allowances for workplace creches while the pressure groups are far from satisfied with the current state of things arguing that all expenses for childcare should be allowable against income tax they do agree that five years of a labour government has produced a friendlier climate for working mothers unfortunately it would appear that office culture has not kept pace with such progress further pressure will have to come from mothers rather than fathers,2002-06,doe parental leave men work survey conducted chartered

one of the most unexpected aftereffects of giving birth to a son for yearold tiffany dealhoy was that she started to do her homework tiffanys son jordan is almost seven months old and as he bounces and gurgles on her knee she explains her loathing of school prior to his arrival i didnt do much work at school before i got pregnant and after school i was just going out all the time drinking and clubbing but you cant do that when you know you might have to get up in the middle of the night to a crying baby since ive had jordan my grades have improved a lot he goes to bed around pm every night and after that i sit and do my coursework for my gcses tiffany is one of six pupil mothers who attend an integrated support service centre in langdon hills run by essex county council the centre caters for a variety of children who are out of school for a good reason because of a pregnancy or a baby or because they have school phobia or a medical condition that prevents them attending mainstream school the centre has a creche with two nursery nurses who care for the six babies while their mothers attend three minute classes in their gcse subjects most are doing core subjects such as maths english science art and child development the majority of girls who come here are or though there have been pupils as young as a un report published last month showed that the uk is second only to the us in its numbers of teenage mothers and yet facilities like this one are not statutory though it is considered good practice to provide them while not every schoolage mother including the girls at langdon hills receives fulltime education hours a week the government is introducing new rules in september which stipulate that all pupils must receive the full number of hours not all leas have the facilities to provide this but a spokesman for the dfes said the government was confident the target would be achieved by september he admitted that the government does not have data on how many educational facilities there are in the uk for schoolage mums although the continuation of their education is a government priority the most recent guidance issued by the dfes last october aims to halve the rate of conceptions by unders by and to get more teenage parents into education training and employment to reduce their risk of longterm social exclusion the uk has the highest rate of teenage pregnancies in western europe each year in england girls conceive of these are under and are under a recent ofsted report criticised schools for not teaching pupils enough about the emotional side of sexual relationships and said they should be countering the message of teen magazines that underage sex is normal and everyone is indulging the dfes teenage pregnancy standards fund introduced in april is aimed at reintegrating schoolage mothers back into education leas with high levels of teenage pregnancy have received m from this fund since april this year an extra leas are receiving funding of or more to reintegrate schoolage parents to date leas have employed specialist reintegration officers to help girls back to education after having a baby an evaluation by researchers at newcastle university of six leas carrying out such work found that the role of the reintegration officer has been successful and last month the learning and skills council the government agency in charge of post education announced plans to fund free childcare for teenage parents to enable them to study for alevels in a pilot scheme m will be made available to provide fulltime childcare places for parents in schools and sixthform colleges tiffanys story of improved grades and a more mature and focused approach to education is a familiar one among pupil mothers who are offered the opportunity to continue their education crucially with a childcare package thrown in it is a pattern that joyce lawson deputy manager of the pupil referral and exclusion service for sandwell lea in the west midlands has witnessed repeatedly until recently lawson ran one of the first and largest units in the country for pupil mothers it averages around girls and offers a comprehensive package of transport for them and their babies to and from the centre antenatal checks and health checks for their babies as well as a nursery whatever keeps these girls in education and training as long as possible gives them a better chance of making their way in the world and not being dependent on benefits says lawson we were established in amid shockhorror stories about gymslip mums in the press if the girls didnt get transport to school the attendance rates of odd per cent would be much lower its hard to struggle on to a bus with a baby a buggy and your school bag particularly if youve had a bad night we brought the health services on site because it avoided the need for the girls to take a whole day off every time they had an antenatal appointment or a baby health checkup weve just changed the creche to a nursery while it was a creche the girls legally had to remain on site but now that it has become a nursery they have more flexibility to pursue studies off site the girls who attend our unit are here because they have a whole range of problems of which their pregnancy is one symptom boys with equivalent problems end up excluded from school nearly all the girls come to us with a history of erratic attendance and various personal issues and nearly all of them turn their lives around with a combination of education and health and emotional care in the cheerfully decorated creche at essex county councils integrated support service oneyearold paige mcarthur beams and walks confidently across the room to explore my notebook and pen nursery nurse sonia hearne says that the creche is a great place for the babies to hone their social skills people are coming in and out of here all the time and the babies love all the attention the girls find it quite hard to keep away when its time for their lessons sharon wilson assistant manager of the integrated support service says units like this one can meet young mothers needs in a way that mainstream schools sometimes cannot some of the girls who do return to their old schools after the birth of their babies find that they want to talk about nappies while all their friends want to discuss is pop stars our main aim is for the girls to do their gcses here but you have to be realistic you cant have a new baby and do gcses a lot of the girls do six gcses enough to go on to college or get a job last year six pupils took a total of gcses the majority received c d or e grades one went on to work in the retail sector another in administration a third went to college while a fourth had a second baby two of the girls are no longer in touch with the unit along with the core gcse subjects the girls have parentcraft lessons in the creche with their babies speakers are often invited to talk about a variety of subjects ranging from first aid and healthy relationships to starting their babies on books its an informal and relaxed time for the girls says chris morgan who is in charge of the parenting programme wilson believes that support from staff and peers plays a vital role in the girls success at the unit we value being able to give the girls an education while at the same time acknowledging that they are mums if theyve had a bad night with their baby they can moan to us and then go off to their lessons none of the three of the girls who gaze adoringly at their babies in the creche planned their pregnancies while all say they wouldnt be without their babies melanie brown paiges mum wishes that she had thought a little more carefully about her options when she discovered that she was two months pregnant i hated school and couldnt wait to leave i was just when i got pregnant and i thought well ill give it a go i love paige to bits but i wouldnt have had her if i had thought about the pregnancy a bit more carefully she finds that the responsibility she has taken on for her baby means that she is no longer the carefree teenager she used to be my mum is very supportive and will look after paige if i want to go out in the evening but its not the same as before im always ringing up from wherever i have gone to make sure that shes all right in the first few weeks after i had her i thought i might as well be dead but things have got better since then like tiffany she has seen a marked improvement in her academic work since having her baby at school the teachers were awful but here they treat us nicely she says she is uncertain about what she wants to do when she leaves the unit at the end of the summer term but hopes to find a job that involves communicating with people i know that im definitely not going to have any more babies i just wish id considered before i had this one how much it would change my life tiffany says that she knew from the age of four that she wanted to work with children as a nursery nurse having her own baby has only strengthened her resolve i want to do an nvq in childcare at college after i leave here and the place i want to go to has a creche that jordan will be able to go to when i discovered that i was two months pregnant i thought oh no what should i do but i knew i could never get rid of it for yearold kali field caring for her fivemonthold daughter ellie has not only improved her attitude to her studies but has also changed her relationship with her own mother i never used to listen to my mum and i used to find school so boring that i never learnt anything now im more mature i do listen to my mum i want to learn and i want to take my gcses though im not sure what ill do afterwards lawson believes that comprehensive childcare remains the key to helping schoolage mothers to complete their education joe public tends to think why should we pay for that but it is the difference between them gaining skills and holding down a job or being dependent on benefits the daughters of many teenage mums go on to become teenage mums themselves providing proper support for these girls is the only way were going to break the cycle,2002-06,one unexpected aftereffect giving birth son yearold tiffany dealhoy wa started homework tiffany son jordan almost seven month old bounce gurgle knee

in the spirit of national selfexamination which swept the country last week the equal opportunities commission has investigated how womens role in the workplace has changed over the past years some of the changes have been sweeping most notably on the upper rungs of the career ladder for example women now make up of professions such as law and accountancy years ago only were women this change could not have come about without an enormous increase in higher education since entry to these professions is restricted to graduates women now make up more than half of those on degree courses compared with just under a quarter in that year only of school leavers went on to university this means that the population of universityeducated women has soared rather than doubled yet surprisingly the office workplace is more highly gendered than it was in back then women made up of the clerical and administrative workforce now the figure is the secretarial agencies insist that the number of men in the sector is increasing and indeed the pendulum may be swinging back to where things were years ago a few years ago men made up of the clerical workforce compared to the figure published by the the eoc last week numbers aside there is also the question of how the quality of life has changed for clerical workers the advent of the personal computer is said to have finished the monotony of the typing pool and broken up secretarial work into specialisations some which are quite lucrative such as document production in law firms yet as it raises expectations of productivity many workers remain as immobile at their desks as secretaries did in the typing pool days and while secretarial workers now have more independence in their work this responsibility can be accompanied by the expectation that they will skip lunch hours to keep up like truth itself progress is rarely pure and never simple,2002-06,spirit national selfexamination swept country last week equal opportunity commission ha investigated womens role workplace ha changed past year change sweeping notably upper rung career ladder example woman make profession law accountancy year ago woman change could come without enormous increase higher education since entry profession restricted graduate woman make half degree course compared quarter year school leaver went university mean population universityeducated woman ha soared rather doubled yet surprisingly office workplace highly gendered wa back woman made clerical administrative workforce figure secretarial agency insist number men sector increasing indeed pendulum may swinging back thing year ago year ago men made clerical workforce compared figure published eoc last week number aside also question quality life ha changed clerical worker advent personal computer said finished monotony typing pool broken secretarial work specialisation quite lucrative document production law firm yet raise expectation productivity many worker remain immobile desk secretary typing pool day secretarial worker independence work responsibility accompanied expectation skip lunch hour keep like truth progress rarely pure never simple,"['spirit', 'national', 'selfexamination', 'swept', 'country', 'last', 'week', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'commission', 'ha', 'investigated', 'womens', 'role', 'workplace', 'ha', 'changed', 'past', 'year', 'change', 'sweeping', 'notably', 'upper', 'rung', 'career', 'ladder', 'example', 'woman', 'make', 'profession', 'law', 'accountancy', 'year', 'ago', 'woman', 'change', 'could', 'come', 'without', 'enormous', 'increase', 'higher', 'education', 'since', 'entry', 'profession', 'restricted', 'graduate', 'woman', 'make', 'half', 'degree', 'course', 'compared', 'quarter', 'year', 'school', 'leaver', 'went', 'university', 'mean', 'population', 'universityeducated', 'woman', 'ha', 'soared', 'rather', 'doubled', 'yet', 'surprisingly', 'office', 'workplace', 'highly', 'gendered', 'wa', 'back', 'woman', 'made', 'clerical', 'administrative', 'workforce', 'figure', 'secretarial', 'agency', 'insist', 'number', 'men', 'sector', 'increasing', 'indeed', 'pendulum', 'may', 'swinging', 'back', 'thing', 'year', 'ago', 'year', 'ago', 'men', 'made', 'clerical', 'workforce', 'compared', 'figure', 'published', 'eoc', 'last', 'week', 'number', 'aside', 'also', 'question', 'quality', 'life', 'ha', 'changed', 'clerical', 'worker', 'advent', 'personal', 'computer', 'said', 'finished', 'monotony', 'typing', 'pool', 'broken', 'secretarial', 'work', 'specialisation', 'quite', 'lucrative', 'document', 'production', 'law', 'firm', 'yet', 'raise', 'expectation', 'productivity', 'many', 'worker', 'remain', 'immobile', 'desk', 'secretary', 'typing', 'pool', 'day', 'secretarial', 'worker', 'independence', 'work', 'responsibility', 'accompanied', 'expectation', 'skip', 'lunch', 'hour', 'keep', 'like', 'truth', 'progress', 'rarely', 'pure', 'never', 'simple']",165
the news will confirm what women have always suspected men benefit more than they do from becoming parents a new study reveals that fathers levels of wellbeing and personal happiness after birth rise significantly more than those of mothers it also furnishes evidence of why jude law david beckham and tony blair all recent parents smile so readily a new father will lose hours of sleep but a new mother can expect to lose dad will have to give up hours of leisure time in pubs and restaurants during the first years of his childs life but mum will miss out on almost hours of fun researcher dr jonathan scales said the big picture is that parenthood has a significantly different impact for men and women women often have to make radical changes in how they use their time because they reduce their paid work dramatically mens adjustments are much more marginal teacher nicola redwood who has a monthold son said he puts everything else in perspective ive derived a lot my husbands the same he gets huge pleasure but i guess he does have it easier he comes in from work and plays with billy i then get on with the washing and doing the dinner steve does his best to help at night and will get me a drink while im breastfeeding but i still do most of the getting up about per cent and even though neither of us goes out very often hes able to go out more alone psychologist oliver james author of britain on the couch said contrary to the impression sometimes given men find parenthood deeply satisfying especially once a child becomes verbal a father can reconnect with his own playful childish past fun is not something most men get at work any more women on the other hand are much more likely to miss work its not just the money its the social life men are more likely to regard the workplace as a source of stress and anxiety tony holder of mothercare said forty years ago we had almost no male customers nine in ten new mothers visit us but now there are huge numbers of fathers too they evidently enjoy parenting new fathers do show some frustrations almost two in five feel dissatisfied with their reduced household income a similar number feel frustrated at changes in their social lives but the number of women who report lower satisfaction with their social lives is almost seven in researchers believe womens greater role in organising family life may contribute to relatively lower satisfaction on becoming parents most women still have the main caring responsibilities confirmed stephen burke of the daycare trust this includes finding childcare which is in short supply and ensuring that children get there in spite of government promises to expand britains childcare there is still just one place for every seven children under the age of eight researchers also established that older fathers such as today presenter john humphrys and soon london mayor ken livingstone derive a boost in personal wellbeing from having children three times higher than that of

although it might sound an odd combination gender and development the two are more closely linked than you might think as a lack of equality for women is one of the reasons why the developing world isnt changing fast enough i became interested in feminist theory while studying a languages degree at nottingham and always thought i would pursue it later on after leaving university i spent a year in tanzania as a volunteer working with street children and it was this experience that spawned my interest in the developing world the course at hull offered both undoubtedly one of the best things about it was that we were able to influence its content although there were other students on gender courses there were only three of us doing the development option which gave us incredible freedom alongside lectures in the gender theories poststructural feminist theory queer theory etc we studied allied areas such as the impact of aids a good example of where the subjects cross over would be the plight of women subsistence farmers in tanzania they are not allowed to own land which stops them from obtaining credit a change in the law would allow them to develop their operations and improve their lives dramatically while i was in africa and once i had learnt enough swahili i started to interview the children i was working with and returned with a huge amount of raw data that i had hoped to use for my dissertation however i was persuaded by my tutors that i had a very unusual resource and that it was probably worthy of a phd today i lead three different lives and its all very confusing i have now started the phd which will hopefully make greater use of the tanzanian experiences i am also helping to evaluate the success of youth projects around the country for a report being compiled by the social policy unit at hull and working as an editorial assistant for oxfams inhouse magazine here in oxford almost by default i have become a bit of an expert on focus groups and associated research this week ive been asking children in gateshead to talk about the youth projects they have been involved in in the past ive interviewed women living in poor areas of the uk to describe their experiences for research into social exclusion my goal is to work fulltime for an organisation such as oxfam and to continue looking at the role of women in developing societies im definitely returning to tanzania to continue my phd research ill have to see where it leads me milesbrignallblueyondercouk,2002-06,although might sound odd combination gender development two closely

isabel wants me to play monopoly i cant i tell her why not it begins with w and has four letters i respond wearily the summer holidays are here and it hasnt taken long for boredom to surface as families go though were lucky in many respects we both work from home and with luck there will be stretches between setting up the crazy daisy dropping them at friends houses and feeding them plates of pasta when the children will entertain themselves and we can work for many working parents finding ways to keep the children safely occupied will prove stressful and costly during the summer school break the choice is often between taking up to six weeks off and losing your income if your employer will let you and you can afford it or paying for childcare which rises rapidly in cost the more children you have and then all those educational activity weeks and visits to theme parks are guaranteed to drive another large dent in your bank balance anne longfield chief executive of charity kids club network says it can be a nightmare for working parents the majority will be juggling to look after their kids relying to some extent on family members partially on using their own holiday entitlement and using bits of childcare provision in some cases both parents have to take their holiday entitlement on a rota basis because that is the only way they can stretch to cover the holidays but it isnt good for the family if they cant take holidays together the kids club network has highlighted a shortage in the number of places at outofschool clubs for children this summer although these have doubled from in to today the charity says this represents a place for only of school age children or less than one in in scandinavian countries at least of children have access to outofschool childcare says longfield the waiting lists at many clubs here are growing and i believe there is demand for at least of children to be able to go to a club the average cost of an outofschool club in the holidays is per child per week for all types of summer holiday play schemes the average is a week or more than for the sixweek summer break according to a survey by the charity daycare trust stephen burke director of the trust says that is beyond the means of many lowincome families and the hours the schemes operate are often too few for parents needs childminders charge an average of per child per hour which works out at between and a week to cover a parent working full time kay lyons communications director for the national childminding association says parents who use a childminder during term time are lucky because they have access to continuous care during the holidays lyons points out however that childminders are able to look after a maximum of six children including their own so there is little scope to take in others during holidays the problem now is that grandparents seem to be working longer themselves and people move around with their jobs so grandparents are often not near enough to help out she says parents on the lowest incomes who have to pay for childcare can get some help with the costs the governments childcare tax credit can cover up to of a maximum incurred each week but for those earning more than a year with one child or with two or more the subsidy tapers off with high childcare costs and inadequate provision it is hardly surprising that many parents are forced to use up their leave entitlement from work to look after their children a survey of working parents carried out by researchers bmrb for abbey national found that intended to stop working altogether for the summer holidays while a further will have to cut their working hours losing part of their income abbey national estimated that working parents with two children could easily spend on childcare and the same amount again on entertaining children during the sixweek break the most fortunate working parents perhaps are those whose employer provides a workplace play scheme during the holidays this is most likely to be offered by big companies such as high street banks as well as nhs trusts which are desperate to hang on to female staff according to maggy meadeking communications manager for the organisation parents at work such schemes are usually subsidised by the employer and may be situated at or near the workplace as meadeking points out however as children get older they tend to be less keen to go to this type of scheme some employers she says offer it in term time only while others allow employees to take extra time off during troughs in the workload for many parents though the solution is to take some work home and manage it alongside keeping an eye on the children the trouble is there is far more in the way of perils including traffic for parents to worry about now few would be happy to let younger children go out of sight for long for working mothers in particular the worry of how to cope with school holidays almost certainly holds back many from seeking more ambitious careers those in highpowered jobs may find that their salary enables them to hire a fulltime nanny or have a livein au pair who can take much of the burden of looking after the children many of these mothers probably feel however that they are missing out whats the point of your children having long holidays if you arent able to spend any of that time with them what most of us would really ask of our employers says meadeking of parents at work is simply to be sympathetic employers can help by being understanding and flexible she

a new generation of overs are spurning the tradition of leaving money for their children to inherit and are instead spending it on living the high life nearly threequarters of retirees surveyed by insurer eagle star were happy to spend all their savings on having fun in their later years rather than putting it towards their offsprings inheritance just per cent of men put anything away for their children at all the new youngatheart retirees are using savings to socialise shop and travel nearly a third of those over the age of and per cent of those over admitted travelling frequently i spent my youth bringing up four children and now i would like to do the sort of things i thought i would do when i was a teenager before things took a different path said virginia johnson a former child and

myself to the full until im well into my eighties i have some ideas about my pension but im thinking first and foremost about this next stage in my life the survey found that more than one in overs socialised three or more nights a week while overall the retired population spent an average of a month on cars on nights on the town and on grandchildren women aged over spent almost a month on their hair and a month on clothes men in the same age group spent at least a month on clothes and almost a month on keeping fit phil ost of eagle star believes there has been a seismic shift in peoples attitudes to retirement while in the past retirees felt a responsibility to live sensibly this research shows the new breed of overs is really relishing the opportunities and rewards retirement brings he said they have planned and saved for these years so spending savings that could otherwise be put towards an inheritance for their children seems to be a sound way in which to fund these lifestyles

nearly one in women in england and wales an estimated victims have been raped since they were according to home office research the official british crime survey also found that women aged between and had been raped in the previous months nearly times the number of rapes recorded by the police the home office research estimates that one in women have experienced some form of sexual victimisation including rape since the age of suggesting that the sexual abuse of women is a more widespread problem in britain than has been officially acknowledged the study explodes the myth of the safe home and the idea that real rape is committed by a stranger in a oneoff violent attack it shows that most rapes take place in the victims own home and that women are most likely to be attacked by their partner of cases strangers were responsible for only of rapes reported to the survey the results suggest that the traditional perception of rape as perpetrated by strangers in public places is a false one says the report a large proportion of rape and sexual victimisation occurs in domestic settings it is also apparent that sexual attacks by partners are more likely to result in physical injury and are more likely to be repeated than attacks by any other perpetrator however victims of sexual attacks by partners are least likely to view these as criminal the british crime survey report shows the reluctance of many women to tell anybody about what has happened about a third have never told anybody about what hap pened to them although there has been a greater willingness among victims to report rapes in recent years only about one in five rapes or sexual assaults come to the attention of the police the researchers say that there is still a preoccupation with real rape in the british criminal justice system and one in five of those who reported their rape to the police say they were dissatisfied with the way they dealt with the case the latest official figures show that only of cases reported to the police result in a conviction for rape or attempted rape the study says that those most at risk are women aged between and those facing higher than average risks of sexual attack are single women students and women living in privately rented homes the home office minister john denham said last night that the government was determined to turn around the low reporting and conviction rates for rape this new research dispels some of the myths about rape and sexual victimisation especially the stereotype of the majority of rapes being committed by strangers in public places he said he added that the governments action plan would give victims the confidence to report the rape and go through the trial process among the measures being considered are anonymity for the victims of domestic violence allowing juries to be told information about previous convictions and conduct where relevant and reforming the law on double jeopardy in cases where new evidence comes to light the government has put together a package of measures including a network of specialist prosecutors to deal with rape cases a first response kit for police officers to prevent the loss of vital forensic evidence in rape cases and the requirement for a specialist second opinion before a decision is taken to drop a rape prosecution the government action plan takes up recommendations from a critical report by her majestys inspectorate of constabulary and her majestys crown prosecution service inspectorate into the investigation and prosecution of rape allegations which was published in april the measures introduced by the home office will be reviewed every three months,2002-07,nearly one woman england wale estimated victim raped since according home office research official british

the government will launch new training programmes for police officers in sensitive handling of cases backed up by new standards for collecting forensic evidence in the vital first hours after an allegation a national review of the way rape victims are treated in police stations will also be launched in hopes of extending the use of special facilities such as rape suites where women can be interviewed and examined privately in homely surroundings home office minister john denham and solicitor general harriet harman will also outline plans to boost domestic violence prosecutions including new powers for judges to issue restraining orders preventing convicted men from approaching their wives when released from prison and a consultation on whether domestic violence victims

the government through its spending review has taken a major step towards ending the childcare lottery in britain substantial investment in childrens centres is coupled with a new vision for childcare and early years services over the next decade this vision has been prompted by a fundamental cross cutting review of childcare clearly the childcare market isnt working particularly for families living in the most disadvantaged areas the childcare lottery currently means that access to services depends on where families live their income and their employment there is only one childcare place for every seven children under the age of eight and british parents pay the highest childcare bills in europe the interdepartmental childcare review has emphasised the importance of childcare to extending employment opportunities and tackling child poverty childcare also plays a role in meeting other key objectives including boosting productivity and closing the gender pay gap the findings of the childcare review will be published this autumn the review highlights significant benefits to children particularly young children and those from disadvantaged backgrounds when good quality childcare is delivered alongside early years education family support and health services it also points to the need to transform the way in which policy is made and services are delivered to reflect an integrated approach in response the government has decided to bring together responsibility for childcare early years and sure start within a single interdepartmental unit in support of the vision and the review the budget for the new unit will rise to bn by and within this funding for childcare will more than double in real terms between and this will ensure the creation of at least childcare places by including childcare provided directly in childrens centres new funding will be directed towards sustaining provision in the most disadvantaged areas and will support the growth of full day care and out of school clubs and provide grants for new childminders support the creation and operation of childrens centres in disadvantaged areas building where possible on sure start facilities and other existing provision by march an additional children will have access to health education and other services this will complement the greater role that schools will be able to play following the education bill as a base for wider community and family services including childcare for older children as well as joining up existing services and merging the relevant units nationally the government also intends to simplify funding arrangements streamline targets and enhance local authorities role in supporting delivery once the dust has settled we will be able to assess what more needs to be done to turn the vision into reality we must listen to what families say they want in their community to help parents work and give children the support they need an expansion of integrated services through childrens centres will help to address the childcare lottery and achieve wider government policy aims the increased funding is crucial not just to create new childcare but also to support existing services in disadvantaged areas the review of childcare has provided a once in a lifetime opportunity to set a vision for childcare for all children and parents who want and need it the government has seized the opportunity so that we can begin to catch up with the rest of europe now the ambition and extra resources must be turned into a better future for all children and families

what is to be done about unequal pay between men and women although deliberate discrimination has been illegal for more than years the problem is still with us a questionnaire from online recruiter topjobs found that more than half of women feel they have been discriminated against over pay and threequarters of those questioned men and women believed that women are generally paid less than men overall the respondents believed the gender gap is closing but men tended to be more confident than women most economists who have investigated the subject would be inclined to agree that there is discrimination according to one such source on average women are paid less than men but estimates vary tending to reflect what each economist thinks is the cause one school of thought argues that the problem is the jobs women do low pay is not spread evenly over all occupations but is concentrated in one or two such as cleaning and lowpaid jobs are mostly done by women so it is said women in lowpaid jobs drag down the figure for average pay while elsewhere the gender gap is narrower the same principle applies to the professions the lowestpaid of these is teaching the majority of teachers are women ergo factor out teachers and there is little difference in the more prosperous professions between what men and women earn so what about the example of julie bower a share analyst who found her bonuses lagged behind those of her male colleagues and who successfully took her case to a tribunal the fact is that basic salary is never the whole story much remuneration depends on bonuses or overtime while salaries may be equal opportunities to boost them may not according to the equal opportunities commission of employers believe they are equal payers asked how they knew however and it turned out that they just sort of did none had actually checked the commission has a package of five searching questions that employers might like to ask themselves if they wish their actions to match

women continue to get paid less than half the amount earned by men according to government figures yesterday which show that the gender gap has been little affected by changes to employment law and benefits since labour came to power in the women and equality unit at the department of trade and industry said of women earned less than a week from pay benefits and tax credits in but less than of men more than half of all women but only a quarter of all men had disposable incomes of less than a week after taking account of childcare travel to work tax and national insurance the weekly average total individual income for women in was compared with for men these were the median averages with as many above the figure as below the dti figures estimated individual earnings they did not compare living standards in households where incomes were shared julie mellor chairwoman of the equal opportunities commission said these shocking figures reveal how many women are still existing on the breadline although a minority may have access to top jobs and generous incomes for the majority low pay or no pay remains a fact of life it was unlikely that women on such low incomes would be able to save for a pension and proposals to scrap survivors benefits would leave many in even more dire straits inequality on this scale demands urgent action employers must ensure their pay systems are fair that their working practices dont keep women with children in low paid jobs or force them out of work altogether ms mellor said the dti said womens median average weekly total individual income as a proportion of that of men increased from in to in across all age bands median individual incomes for women were less than for men women earned most between and when they averaged a week of the figure for men men earned most between and when they averaged a week slightly less than of total family income of couples came through the man and through the woman this proportion was similar across all family income bands the dti said ms mellor added we need more affordable childcare and a change in britains working culture so that men can play their part in family life and enable more women to

women in public sector jobs work long hours report greater stress than men and are put off having children because of their careers a new study has shown more than half the women surveyed did not have children and some said their jobs were not compatible with having a family according to the economic and social research council report men and women working for social services the police and in secondary schools across britain were interviewed in depth and were sent questionnaires for the study it showed that despite management reforms women continued to be more disadvantaged than men within public service organisations women who did have children were particularly conscious of the pressures of work many reported an increasing workload and more stress this was particularly true in social services where constrained resources long hours and a high level of commitment brought additional pressures policewomen were more optimistic about future career opportunities but some reported bullying sexual discrimination and problems caused by an old boys network many women also experienced tensions in taking on what they saw as highly masculine professional identities said the report gender and restructuring managerial roles and identities in the public sector some of the women in more competitive typicallymasculine jobs promoted a more feminine management style which emphasised cooperation partnership and a more customercentred public service ethos as well as tensions created by largescale reform of public services in the past decade changes have brought in a competitive businessstyle culture and the study shows women have found it hardest to adjust but changes in management style offer opportunities to challenge the imbalance in gender power relations concluded the report by dr annette davies and dr robyn thomas of cardiff business school a spokeswoman for public sector union unison said the surveys findings backed up its own and helped explain why local government workers felt compelled to strike next week unison research earlier this year found that of women in local government were actively looking for a new job felt their job was less secure and said morale had dropped since last year there is a big pay gap between men and women in the public sector particularly in local government which makes it hard for women to afford childcare shift work

women mps are to launch an attack on the no means yes culture of rape cases demanding safeguards to prevent men falsely claiming that their victims were willing to have sex the home office is already considering a shakeup of the law governing consent to sex around which many date rape cases in which the woman knows her attacker revolve but labour women mps are seeking to drum up public support for radical reforms amid fears that the plans could be watered down in the face of strong opposition controversy has been stirred by cases like that of the australian snooker star quinten hann who was last week cleared of rape after a jury heard that his supposed victim had programmed her phone number into his mobile phone and arranged to meet him for lunch after they had sex the female student admitted getting drunk going to hanns hotel room and sitting astride him when he was naked but claimed she had said no to sex because she felt guilty about her boyfriend hanns lawyer ivan lawrence told the jury that sometimes in the heat of passion when a woman says no she doesnt necessarily mean no although home secretary david blunkett has now secured a slot in this autumns queens speech for a shakeup of sex offences legislation ministers are still drafting their proposals on reforming rape law julia drown mp for swindon will attempt to launch a debate on reform later this month with a backbench bill calling for a duty on male defendants who claim that the woman was a willing partner to prove they had made all reasonable efforts to check she really did freely agree to sex judges would also be forced to direct juries that there are certain circumstances under which consent cannot be a defence which could include the woman being drunk unconscious threatened with force or intimidated i want to put down the marker that this is what we should be doing saying that we should change to the canadian model which is one of free agreement that means reasonable steps having been taken said drown we need to make sure we have the public and womens organisations on side critics will argue that could turn every sexual encounter into a negotiating minefield with men having to ask permission every step of the way but campaigners argue that too many men have been getting away with convincing juries that simply because a woman was flirting with them no could really mean yes drowns minute rule bill which gets its first reading on july has no real chance of becoming law but will be used by backbenchers to put pressure on the home office not to retreat ministers are worried

as the comprehensive spending review deadline approaches campaigns of all kinds are fighting right down to the line region vies with region old against young quickhit versus longterm keeping the middle classes on side versus targeting all on the neediest who offers most social justice bang for the buck clapham park estate one of lambeths worst is a new deal for communities regeneration area whose progress i have been following step by step watching how labours plans work out on the ground one of its greatest needs childcare was laid bare last week when dawn primarolo paymaster general and former single mother came to visit she spoke at the new thresholds centre set up by the peabody trust it is a perfect new labour project with tough targets for getting local people trained and into work people into jobs in the first year qualifications gained and good new childcare places this is ideal joinedup thinking set in the only bright shiny new building here as yet designed to entice people into daily adult it classes and homework clubs for children with keepfit and beauty sessions mothers come for company and are drawn into training but all this works only because it makes highclass permanent childcare the essential ingredient for getting mothers back into mainstream life that day was the launch of a drive to recruit and train childminders on the estate a survey had found there are none at all here among the inhabitants many have joined the national mass exodus there are a quarter fewer childminders than three years ago recruiting new ones is not easy it now takes up to months to be registered with ofsted there is a shortage of hundreds of childcare places just on this estate preventing many mothers from working the scale of this need is breathtaking but that is the way it is in most poor areas without childcare the governments target of getting of single mothers into work will never be met so far only work a bare more than in it seems grudging to complain when before labour there was virtually nothing the tories denied childcare was a government function at all prodded by women ministers and mps gordon brown was persuaded that welfare to work would fail without it so there are child care credits for poorer families and a national strategy promising places for a million children by and sure start for a third of poor preschool children how is it all going not brilliantly new neighbourhood nurseries have taken longer to set up than expected waiting for planning consent with a shortage of trained staff but the alarming figures are these nearly a million children have been found new childcare already but that is only half the story the day care trust the main lobby group reckons that the government is double counting it is more than children doubled up parttime in places many mothers would work longer if they had fulltime childcare worse still as fast as new places are being created old ones are closing down i spoke to the distraught leader of one outofschool club closing in birmingham leaving no local holiday scheme this summer nothing next term and parents giving up their jobs counting those going out of business the net gain has only been about only half as many just extra places why so many closures when new money is pouring in the story has a familiar ring the government is determined to use the private and voluntary sector instead of creating new council nurseries poorer families are paid child care credits to buy private or voluntary childcare but nurseries cannot break even let alone make a profit on the money the credits pay on average a week low paid women still have to find at least for one child and they are sunk if they have two as a result most new nurseries are in richer areas even government funding for special neighbourhood nurseries in the poorer areas turns out to be only pumppriming insecure money which tapers away to zero after the third year getting money out of the government is anyway a nightmare trawl through separate streams of funding from multiple regeneration funds and zones childcare falls between the cracks and since the departure of margaret hodge it no longer has a special minister in the commons but only a share of the lords education minister busy with schools and universities the answer is simple though expensive every area needs its own local childrens centre pulling together everything families need from health visitors day care parenting support skills training and employment help afterschool and homework club for allcomers rich and poor the vigorous campaign for childrens centres has a great groundswell of support so far the government has spent a fair amount on children but has had scant popular credit for what it has done as ever services just aimed at the poor will always be politically invisible a government review from the performance and innovation unit has been trying to make sense of all this confusion and will report in time for the csr but i hear its proposals are likely to be modest there will be no universal childrens centres not even promised for the far future there will more neighbourhood nurseries in the most deprived of wards by but only of poor families live in poor wards there will be solid ongoing subsidies for nurseries in the poorest places there will be a more unified coherent system for delivering the childcare that is promised sure start has been phenomenally popular and will also roll out to most poor areas there may be more money for child care credits all this is good but what an opportunity will be missed universal childrens centres could be labours beacon including all parents in a great social programme paying according to means reviving the idea of the welfare state in new centres so resoundingly popular and necessary that no future tory government would dare dismantle them british parents pay for more than of their childcare when in the rest of europe pays under hitting all income groups since paying for childcare cripples family budgets quite high up the social scale lack of it keeps women at all levels in lower paid parttime work keeping the gender pay gap wide the mentality that restricts state childcare to a safety net to shift the poor off welfare and into work is the same political timidity that keeps this a low tax country with low expectations of what the public purse can do to improve the quality of life childrens centres would deliver a mighty political dividend breathing enthusiasm into a new generation of parents about what the state and

take the dingy lift behind the bakery in edmonton greens shopping mall and the doors open on to a bright new world of pink walls and primarycoloured toys the view from the third floor window takes in a concrete multistorey and beyond the tower blocks of the most deprived area of the otherwise relatively affluent borough of enfield but the walls inside are papered with childrens paintings of glorious seascapes this is the new home of sure start edmonton one of almost schemes in an ambitious national programme aimed at boosting the health education and life chances of young children living in poverty the idea is to bring together diverse services and agencies who might never otherwise talk a total of partners in enfield ranging from the council and health authority to libraries and wonmens groups to ensure smooth coordination towards common goals as well as creating a physical resource centre for parents and children to attend as with all sure start projects edmontons targets families with children from before birth to their fourth birthday who live in a closely defined area qualifying because of high levels of deprivation support includes everything from parenting help and breast feeding support to speech therapy and nutritional advice today a handful of the or more children in the schemes catchment area are playing in the creche while their mothers or carers munch sandwiches and discuss where they want the project to go a prime aim of sure start is to involve families through the programme in helping their communities move out of poverty and the mums are proving that ministers wellmeaning vision of empowerment will not always be met with unqualified gratitude why they wonder should their readiness to offer their time for tasks such as helping interview new childcare workers go unpaid according to whitehall rules edmonton project managers are investigating rewarding them with childcare or training courses government plans that the year sure start programme should ultimately shift towards community control and fundraising is met not with happy optimism at the ownership offered by wellmeaning ministers but with frustration at the prospect of withdrawal of newly granted help pares panayi whose threeyear old son georgio loves coming to play sessions at the well equipped centre told the meeting they the government give you this money get you started get you all enthusiastic then we are left to go out with the begging bowl if something is going well why shouldnt they carry on funding it and supporting it childminder terri panteli urged an extension of sure start parents meetings and childrens events to evenings and weekends pointing out that parents working full time such as her own employers were otherwise excluded colleen stirling the programmes community development coordinator reassured parents the project wanted them to have a sometimes uncomfortable debate over its progress sure start was nothing without parental involvement and an evaluation commissioned by the edmonton scheme from anglia polytechnic university highlighted the considerable amount of work that partnerships need to do in order to involve and sustain families as active participants in the management and development of a programme the study also found that while families involved with the scheme were happy with the services they used parenting classes the playgroup the language classes supporting the areas ethnic population and the friendship offered they wanted it to help tackle problems with housing lack of play space and difficulty dealing with the council or health service for the programme manager laxmi jamdagni such local responses must be taken on board and parental involvement nurtured while also working towards a rigid set of targets already laid down by the government for all sure start projects the goals range from the broad including ensuring all children covered by the scheme had access to good quality play and learning opportunities and guaranteeing help for postnatal depression to the highly specific such as a cut by in the number of children reregistered on the child protection register within months or a cut in the number of mothers who smoke in pregnancy edmonton like all sure starts must deliver a quarterly report to the sure start unit in the department for education and skills highlighting progress as well as a monthly form detailing numbers of children pregnant mothers and families seen in july children had contact with the programme approaching half of them new faces together with out of the new babies born in the area within the previous two months the targets ms jamdagni said were top priority now that the project had emerged from a slow start and a struggle to secure its new centre launched in june with a celebration meeting the goals would be a supreme challenge she admitted the government targets are very specific and detailed which is horribly frightening if you ask me are we meeting them i say we are aware of them they are challenging we are listening to parents to make the services fit them better but how we measure the progress is also what we are needing to be mindful of addressing targets means in some cases starting from scratch where basic data is simply not available levels of postnatal depression for example have never been accurately quantified and doing so may be difficult in an ethnically diverse area where different cultures might not name the problem in the same way the partner services will also have to do more to share their information overcoming obstacles such as the fact that many are run by staff on part time contracts who have had little or no contact with each other a further hurdle will be the national shortage of some expertise paula sobiechowska one of the anglia polytechnic university evaluators acknowledged that sure starts targetdriven approach meant a lot of number crunching but argued that the focus on health and poverty was positive and sensible the challenge she said was making sense of the targets where there may be pressures greater than those they identify not least the needs of edmontons transient population of asylum seekers while edmonton has some way to go in matching the governments detailed demands those involved acknowledged that some of the schemes greatest strengths

in typical and maddening new labour fashion gordon brown used his grand announcement on spending last month to commit labour to an expansion in childcare costing bn over three years from but gave no details they will come when a cabinet office review is published this autumn until then councils and voluntary groups are guessing the chancellor did offer some specifics every lone parent who wants to work will not be inhibited by lack of child care so labour can realise its commitment to get of lone parents working by a dedicated minister lady ashton will head a unit in the department for education and skills an unspecified number of areas are to have childrens centres to coordinate council and voluntary care along with health advice and parental support there will be hundreds but it will not be the universal childcare lobbied for by the daycare trust the focus remains poorer parents the centres will be in areas of socioeconomic disadvantage benefiting children no one yet knows how they will link with sure start programmes focused on the most deprived council wards such as edmonton in enfield the july announcement was labours latest attempt to deliver on its national childcare strategy promising a revolutionary expansion of public provision and one million more children into childcare at the latest count more have access than in means tested help is offered to parents with a childcare tax credit that costs m a year in enfield the credit pays a week on average to eligible families but a local nursery costs for five days childminding more there is no official acknowledgement of how many parents lack childcare but some estimates suggest a third with preschool children feel restricted by lack of nearby affordable and trust worthy places there is now one full time place for every seven children under eight compared to one in nine in part of the strategy was more early education fouryearolds were all to get into nursery school ofsted inspected their classes integrated with the national curriculum that has been realised a big change in enfield where most began school at five by september all threeyearolds will also have access to a free early education place twothirds of children have at present but nursery classes usually run for a couple of hours in the morning a lot less than needed if mothers are to think of part time work yet for poorer parents labour thought big sure start is potentially an exercise in social engineering and eveningup life chances to of the poorest children the government has made promises of extraordinary detail they should arrive at school at five at the same level as their more fortunate contemporaries based on successful american schemes the idea is to focus resources on small areas identifying children in need even before birth following them through to age four edmonton has one of the schemes in place with a further planned most cover no more than a council ward two in edmontons case in them intense effort is being expended involving nhs primary care trusts council and various partners who benefit from dedicated whitehall money bn in total to within the next couple of years sure start is supposed to have cut by on a year baseline the children aged three and under with speech and language problems that involves more doorknocking by health visitors leading it is hoped to earlier referrals for treatment sure starts are also supposed to cut by at least by the number of very young children living in households where no one has a job they focus on child care while ensuring links with jobcentres those far too specific promises are not going to be met but sure start parents and children may nonetheless benefit in less measurable ways one grand promise is a fall in the number of sure start mothers smoking during in pregnancy but it will depend in edmonton on the effectiveness of a local hospitals cessation programme north middlesex seems to be doing well with of its those doing the course still off tobacco after a year above the average for such schemes but no one seems to have told the data protection registrar or the nhs which jointly forbid collecting data from postcodes

enfields early years development and childcare partnership a planning group required in all authorities had proved an effective clearing house for funds we are lean and mean he said with pride we bring people together to squeeze the most places out of every type of provision as so often childcare and preschooling varies according to location in the divided borough historically it had comparatively few preschools attached to schools and they are thus heavily oversubscribed to hit its nursery target enfield will look mainly to private nurseries that are well established in wealthier

ministers yesterday faced accusations of indecision and bungling amid claims of signficant further delays to the introduction of a computer system at the child support agency poverty campaigners also warned that the continued postponement of the launch scheduled for april this year and now reported to be held up until as late as next summer was depriving children of low income single parent families of sums of up to a week the m system designed to operate a new maintenance formula to simplify and accelerate decisions on support payments by absent parents was developed by a private consortium under the governments private finance initiative the department of work and pensions yesterday declined to comment on reports that work on the system had run at least m over budget or to confirm whether the taxpayer would ultimately have to foot the bill a spokesman said only that the department would not pay the contractor the american computer giant eds until the system had been delivered tested and made fully operational the department also refused to comment on claims by project insiders to the bbc that a new deadline for the systems introduction planned for this november was set to be missed by about six months alistair darling then work and pensions secretary announced in march that he had ordered a delay in the planned launch of the system because testing was not complete the department and the csa yesterday said testing was continuing the agency has million cases on its books while critics will question why eds failed to complete testing of the system in time for the april start date the company yesterday threw the responsibility back on ministers it is completely a ministerial decision about the time frame so that is not eds said a company spokeswoman as for the system there is nothing wrong with it but it is just going through rigorous testing the shadow social security secretary david willetts said that if eds had failed to deliver on its side of the contract it should pick up the bill but he told bbc radio s today programme i suspect that they eds will respond and say that part of the problem at least has been that they have had to wait too long to get clear ministerial decisions on the details of the system before they could go away and write their software in that case sadly it will be the taxpayer who picks up the bill for ministerial mistakes steve webb the liberal democrat work and pensions spokesman said this is the latest in a series of computer bungling by the government in general and the department of work and pensions in particular they seem incapable of running this large scale computer programme either to budget or schedule as a result the families involved with the csa are in complete limbo the gmb union said the delay highlighted the dangers of private finance projects vehemently opposed by trade unions which merely put money in fat cats pockets the child poverty action group warned that delays into next

childrens social backgrounds are more important even than low birthweight in determining how well they achieve in school and later life according to researchers the study published in this weeks british medical journal firmly points at social deprivation and poverty as some of the most significant reasons why some children do less well than others it finds that low birthweight because of premature birth or a poorly nourished mother does affect intellectual development but this effect is not so great as social class barbara jefferis a research fellow at the institute of child health in london believes the study shows the need for more effort in tackling childhood deprivation these results show the strong effect of social background on cognitive development and the need to take seriously policies addressing deprivation in children she and her colleagues studied nearly children born from march to maths reading and other ability tests measured the educational attainment of the children at ages seven and at the age of their highest educational achievement was recorded the team found the gap in educational attainment between children of higher and lower social classes widened as time went on it was greatest by the age of maths scores tended to improve for classes i and ii from the age of seven to while classes iv and v showed a relative decline as time went on maths scores improved for every kilogram of a childs birthweight but differences between children based on birthweight alone were relatively small high birthweight babies born to more deprived families were likely to do less well on average at school than the low birthweight babies of affluent parents ms jefferis said it was difficult to tease out what it was in early life that might hold back children and what part for instance a school could play social background is a simplification of a lot of complex processes she said,2002-08,childrens social background important even low birthweight determining well

the poorest of the poor this weeks annual report of the csa is filled with bombastic selfpromotion under a banner headline proclaiming a year of improved performance it ticks off five targets achieved along with eight different team charter marks under the governments public service award scheme buried in the footnotes but unearthed by steve webb the liberal democrat work and pensions spokesman was the real story a staggering bn of uncollected maintenance owed by absent parents over the nine years of the agencys existence written off this represents of the revenue it should have collected for the eighth consecutive year the national audit office parliaments financial watchdog refused last month to approve the agencys accounts sir john bourn the comptroller and auditor general estimated that of receipts collected by the agency from nonresident parents and of maintenance assessment debts were incorrect looked at historically it gets worse in some of single mothers on income support received maintenance from absent fathers but by the first year of the csas operations this had dropped to nine years on it has only climbed to the chances of the csa achieving its latest public service agreement target some of single parents receiving maintenance by are clearly remote a longawaited reform of the csa which was meant to start in april was postponed because of problems with a new m computer system its introduction had already been delayed from last october ministers refused this week to indicate how long this latest hiccup would last but even when it starts the process will take three years to put the new and the existing million cases on the system this is more than enough time to have a rethink the new reforms are in danger of replacing an overcomplicated system with a too rigidly simplistic one complexity was introduced with the best of motives making the system sensitive to the many different circumstances separated families face but resulted in a bureaucratic nightmare over of csa time was spent assessing how much absent fathers should pay rather than actually collecting the money the new system could not be cruder a set proportion of net income for one child for two and for three for the family that a separated father leaves behind the different factors fed into the old system was wrong but so is failing to take into account wide variations in travel housing and work costs there is an appeal process but it is tightly drawn and follows a rigid formula stand by for a second tide of protests similar to the first wave when the agency started steve webbs idea of a flexible appeal looks a better option his second idea that the inland revenue should take over the csa is also worth a look csa staff already rely heavily on the tax office to track down missing parents as well as the earnings of selfemployed the ir will be in touch with every family through the child benefit scheme why continue the duplication that two agencies generate meanwhile one welcome reform allowing single parents to keep the first of maintenance without an income support deduction should start now and not wait for the

queensland australia after telling the court he was afraid of flying and was preparing for a wedding he was sworn in under both scots and queensland law so as to ensure that if there were any problems relating to his evidence the matter could be dealt with by the australian authorities mr macurcin who was the driver on the tour said some of the group including the accused and the swedish woman had been drinking from two bottles of whisky purchased at a distillery after they checked in at the hostel mr macurcin said he found the woman lying on a bed where she had been sick he took her downstairs to a communal shower area and tried to get her to clean herself up mr macurcin told the court cinci attempted to get into the shower cubicle with the woman who was partially dressed cinci then left

the controversial child support agency has written off bn owed by absent parents since it was set up nine years ago while another m was considered possibly uncollectable it was revealed yesterday the figures hidden in a footnote to the agencys annual report came after parliaments financial watchdog the national audit office refused to approve the agencys accounts for the eighth year running because of a legacy of error steve webb the liberal democrat work and pensions spokesman who unearthed the figures called for the agency to be scrapped it is mindboggling that uncollected payments of bn can be simply written off it is time for the government to admit that the csa has been a fiasco from the start and to scrap it he wants responsibility for collecting maintenance handed to the inland revenue which already does much of the csas work while the csa writes off around m of the m it aims to collect each year the inland revenue collects of the cash it is owed according to mr webb running the csa costs around m a year but the service could not function without information provided by the inland revenue csa staff make inquiries to the inland revenue about missing parents each year and another about the earnings of selfemployed parents savings made by switching responsibility to the taxman would be used to fund bonuses for those who agree not to challenge the level of maintenance payments decided by the inland revenue he suggested the move could also overcome horrendous problems threatened by the new computer system being brought in by the csa designed to provide simple maintenance level calculations based on of a parents income for one child for two and for three last month sir john bourn the comptroller and auditor general estimated that of receipts collected by the agency from nonresident parents and of maintenance assessment debts were incorrect another account statement covering m due from nonresident parents contained overstatement errors of m and understate ment errors of m in debts arising from full maintenance assessment sir john said i continue to be concerned at the high level of error in maintenance assessments it is disappointing that the child support reforms aimed at improving the accuracy of maintenance assessments had to be delayed because testing on a new computer system had not been completed the shadow work and pensions secretary david willetts said delay and uncertainty over a promised replacement for the csa was crippling the service the failure to collect the bn is a scandal the government has been promising for

when laura doohan discovered that she had become a teenage pregnancy statistic at she had already split up with her boyfriend but she decided to have the baby despite her lessthanideal circumstances a strained relationship with her mother meant she could not continue to live at home but she was nervous about moving into council accommodation with a small child instead a very new labour third way presented itself in the shape of a government initiative to end the isolation of unsupported teenage mothers by offering them a place in a new network of motherandbaby hostels the government announced the scheme in an action plan from the social exclusion units teenage pregnancy unit said that all under lone parents unable to live with their families or a partner should by be placed in supervised semiindependent housing with support instead of being offered council tenancies the idea attracted some flak with critics conjuring images of teenage maternity ghettos and warning of further prejudice against an already demonised section of the population but ministers remained committed to the scheme because britains teenage pregnancy rates are the highest in western europe and because many grandmothers are too busy with fulltime jobs to offer the backup once expected of them the housing corporation has so far approved funding for more than units of supported accommodation some newbuild and others refurbishments after inviting bids from housing associations to run the hostels with three of the six pilot projects up and running doohan now and her fivemonthold daughter ruby anais are among the pioneers in this new design for living a halfway house before setting up home on their own two of the first three hostels are in the same road in nottingham the third is in oldham although one of the two in the raleigh street project was formerly a socalled wet hostel for homeless men who drank you would never guess from the colourful furniture and decor the rooms in the handsome redbrick victorian house look more like wellorganised student bedsits doohan and her daughter have their own large light bedroom with en suite bathroom a bed wardrobe microwave kettle and fridgefreezer are provided together with toys donated by the local church they share a lounge kitchen and payphone in the hall with two other teenage mothers and their babies the aim is to enable the girls to acquire childcare budgeting general educational and life skills including birth control in an informal yet supportive environment there is onsite advice from pearl holt the scheme manager and judith hutton a project worker who staff an office in the house in daytime hours during the week and hold weekly oneonone sessions to encourage the girls to set themselves goals there is a cctv camera outside for security and an outofhours emergency number after initial startup costs the project has become selffinancing based on rent receipts and management allowances there is a twoyear limit for each stay but this is flexible and sensitive to differing rates of personal development so that residents will not be moved until they feel ready for independent tenancies this is about helping people to build up their own support networks thats the key says holt im not advocating teenage pregnancy but we are sometimes too negative about them some of these girls have amazing skills next month doohan is beginning a course in media production with the aim of becoming a journalist while ruby is looked after in the college creche at first it was funny telling people i was living in a motherandbaby home she admits i suppose it was the stigma of teenage mums but my friends were fine and its a brilliant safety net of support a fourth pilot to be run by the ekaya housing association is due to open next january in lambeth south london jackie kelly ekayas chief executive says an onsite computer facility will encourage the young mothers to go back into education in order to build for their future there were she admits some nimby objections to the project from locals some people thought we were a battered womens hostel which we are not and that boyfriends would be turning up and causing rows she says in fact we teach social skills about living with your neighbours and being responsible and the teenage mums enjoy the fact that there are other women like them there they dont feel stigmatised and there is peer support although the aims are practical care professionals are concerned that the scheme may be seen as a punitive kneejerk reaction to media hostility towards teenage mothers getting council tenancies the social exclusion unit report was widely seen as a response to the belief that teenage girls deliberately become pregnant to get a flat yet doohans positive experience is an encouraging sign for the policy of going back to the future by reinventing and updating the concept of motherandbaby homes her relationship with her mother has improved a lot she says since she moved into the homefromhome atmosphere of raleigh street where the big issue at the moment is a tentative experiment in allowing overnight visitors twice a week without changing the dynamic of the centre a dilemma all too familiar to the parents of teenagers the journey from sin to support supported housing for mothers and babies has traditionally been run by religious charities which have also operated as adoption and fostering agencies fifty years ago the strict regimes in such homes reflected the stigma then associated with childbirth outside marriage residents slept in dormitories ate communally and went to bible classes each stay was limited to three months with new mothers given six weeks after the birth to decide whether to give up her baby for adoption apart from an assisted passage to australia as a mailorder bride for a lonely sheep farmer willing to take on another mans child the only way that a lone mother could hope to keep her baby without support from a partner or family was to stay in a hostel as a domestic worker her child was looked after in the hostel nursery even as late as the s such homes were demonised as sin bins particularly in ireland and parts of liverpool where unmarried mothers worked in the notorious conventrun magdalen laundries after being forced to give up their children for adoption but by the early s growing public awareness of the scandalous conditions forced the closure of the magdalens these days the catholic church runs a number of motherandbaby homes for unsupported women on more enlightened and sympathetic lines other schemes run by nondenominational religious charities such as the croydonbased christian family concern describe themselves as bedsits rather than homes and have long since dropped any adoption role similar schemes such as the birminghambased edmonds court foyer also provide training education and employment for young mothers these have proved useful models for the governments new

women who are drunk or under the influence of drugs will automatically be regarded as unable to give consent to sex as part of an overhaul of the law on rape to be announced next month the change is part of a tighter definition of what amounts to consent to sex which will severely restrict the circumstances in which a man can offer the defence that he honestly believed the woman involved wanted to have sex ministers have come down against creating a separate offence of date rape or acquaintance rape on the grounds it would make it seem that such an attack was in some way less serious than being raped by a stranger the changes in the definition of consent will apply to all forms of rape which is expected to include oral and anal sex without consent so that they can carry a life sentence home office ministers were angered by suggestions yesterday that proposed reforms were some kind of kneejerk response to the furore surrounding the allegation made by the television celebrity ulrika jonsson that she had been raped by a television presenter the home secretary has approved no formula for change and is considering very carefully this very difficult and sensitive issue a spokesman said speculation on specific formula or wording does not help as it carries no authority or agreement at the political level the reform of the rape law forms part of a much wider overhaul of britains laws on sexual offences initiated with a government consultation paper two years ago britains most senior police officer sir john stevens the commissioner of the metropolitan police yesterday appealed to rape victims to go to the police he said claims the police were unsympathetic to victims of rape were based on outdated attitudes it is absolutely essential that if a woman goes through the trauma of rape whatever the circumstances that she reports it to the police he said the home secretary david blunkett pledged to reform the laws on rape in july saying the fall in the conviction rate from one in three reported rapes in to one in was unacceptable his proposals have not yet been finalised but are expected to be based on a home office review setting the boundaries published in july that review written by betty moxon a civil servant recommended placing strict limits on when the honest belief defence could be used a defence of honest belief in free agreement should not be available where there was selfinduced intoxication recklessness as to consent or if the accused did not take all reasonable steps in the circumstances to ascertain free agreement at the time home office sources make clear they are not talking about the negotiation of a legally watertight agreement before two people go to bed but stress that a rape that follows an evening out is not about any kind of

men will be forced to prove they have made efforts to ensure their sexual partners are willing in a government crackdown on date rape this will close a legal loophole that allows rape suspects to walk free by saying they honestly believed the woman involved wanted sex even if she was fighting them off under the reforms men could use this defence only if they could show a court they took steps to ensure the voluntary and genuine agreement of a partner to sex they could no longer argue that a womans sexual history alone for example entitled them to think she wanted to sleep with them the move follows the furore over the tv presenter ulrika jonssons claim that she was raped as a yearold by a fellow celebrity but lacked the courage to report it the man denies the allegation saying she consented we do not expect everyone to sign a contract before they get into bed with someone that is a complete nonsense but date rape is not about any kind of consensual sex said one home office source it is important that people see rape as something that is not only about a stranger attacking you critics will argue however that the proposals would turn dating into a politically correct minefield with suitors having to negotiate women into bed in a way that would withstand scrutiny by a court but ministers say falling conviction rates show too many men are getting away with acquaintance rape now the commonest form the home office insists it is not targeting ordinary seductions but a macho culture of men who believe buying a girl dinner entitle them to sex the crackdown will also restrict defendants ability to dredge up a womans sexual past juries are reluctant to convict in cases where the attacker is a friend or a former or present partner of the victim the honest belief defence allows a man to argue he thought the woman was consenting even though she was not she might for example have said no or struggled but he was confused by mixed messages the victims own testimony that the man seemed convinced he was doing nothing wrong may even be used by the defence under the proposals based on canadian law consent would be tightly redefined as voluntary and genuine agreement defendants argue either she was consenting or if she wasnt i didnt believe it said vera baird a labour mp and leading barrister women who have been raped are not getting criminal justice ministers have taken no final decisions yet home secretary david blunkett will announce a sex offences bill including rape reforms in next months queens speech detailed proposals will follow later the home office is privately worried about a male backlash because of entrenched attitudes focus groups run by the university of surrey this year found many men unclear where lines should be drawn one

the alleged rape of tv presenter ulrika jonsson has brought the issue of date rape into new focus jonsson says that a vicious attack on her years ago by a man she declines to name led to her spending four days in hospital she was a young woman at the time and felt unable to bring charges crime statistics suggest her reluctance is shared by the vast majority of rape victims police believe that fewer than per cent of rapes are reported to them of those reports last year fewer than one in will result in conviction such figures explain why so many women have lost confidence in the present law government plans to reform the rape laws which we report today are long overdue and welcome first they acknowledge that most rapes are committed by acquaintances rather than unknown assailants second they apply common sense to a murky area of the law which has made it hard to secure convictions the proposals will restrict the defence of honest belief which currently enables a defendant to claim he mistakenly thought there was consent to sex even if there is evidence to the contrary these plans will not lead to couples needing to sign contracts before having sex as has been claimed they will however require a cultural shift in the popular perception of date rape as somehow not a real crime and we welcome the drafters intention to make it difficult for the defence to raise a victims sexual history in court this alone will remove a major obstacle to raped women and men pressing rape charges the success of the proposed reforms will ultimately be measured by their ability to secure convictions for a crime that remains a shaming secret lifescarring experience for tens of thousands of victims each year,2002-10,alleged rape tv presenter ulrika jonsson ha brought issue date rape new focus jonsson say vicious attack year ago man decline name led spending four day hospital wa young woman time felt unable bring charge crime statistic suggest reluctance shared vast majority rape victim police believe fewer per cent rape reported report last year fewer one result conviction figure explain many woman lost confidence present law government plan reform rape law report today long overdue welcome first acknowledge rape committed acquaintance rather unknown assailant second apply common sense murky area law ha made hard secure conviction proposal restrict defence honest belief currently enables defendant claim mistakenly thought wa consent sex even evidence contrary plan lead couple needing sign contract sex ha claimed however require cultural shift popular perception date rape somehow real crime welcome drafter intention make difficult defence raise victim sexual history court alone remove major obstacle raped woman men pressing rape charge success proposed reform ultimately measured ability secure conviction crime remains shaming secret lifescarring experience ten thousand victim year,"['alleged', 'rape', 'tv', 'presenter', 'ulrika', 'jonsson', 'ha', 'brought', 'issue', 'date', 'rape', 'new', 'focus', 'jonsson', 'say', 'vicious', 'attack', 'year', 'ago', 'man', 'decline', 'name', 'led', 'spending', 'four', 'day', 'hospital', 'wa', 'young', 'woman', 'time', 'felt', 'unable', 'bring', 'charge', 'crime', 'statistic', 'suggest', 'reluctance', 'shared', 'vast', 'majority', 'rape', 'victim', 'police', 'believe', 'fewer', 'per', 'cent', 'rape', 'reported', 'report', 'last', 'year', 'fewer', 'one', 'result', 'conviction', 'figure', 'explain', 'many', 'woman', 'lost', 'confidence', 'present', 'law', 'government', 'plan', 'reform', 'rape', 'law', 'report', 'today', 'long', 'overdue', 'welcome', 'first', 'acknowledge', 'rape', 'committed', 'acquaintance', 'rather', 'unknown', 'assailant', 'second', 'apply', 'common', 'sense', 'murky', 'area', 'law', 'ha', 'made', 'hard', 'secure', 'conviction', 'proposal', 'restrict', 'defence', 'honest', 'belief', 'currently', 'enables', 'defendant', 'claim', 'mistakenly', 'thought', 'wa', 'consent', 'sex', 'even', 'evidence', 'contrary', 'plan', 'lead', 'couple', 'needing', 'sign', 'contract', 'sex', 'ha', 'claimed', 'however', 'require', 'cultural', 'shift', 'popular', 'perception', 'date', 'rape', 'somehow', 'real', 'crime', 'welcome', 'drafter', 'intention', 'make', 'difficult', 'defence', 'raise', 'victim', 'sexual', 'history', 'court', 'alone', 'remove', 'major', 'obstacle', 'raped', 'woman', 'men', 'pressing', 'rape', 'charge', 'success', 'proposed', 'reform', 'ultimately', 'measured', 'ability', 'secure', 'conviction', 'crime', 'remains', 'shaming', 'secret', 'lifescarring', 'experience', 'ten', 'thousand', 'victim', 'year']",160

as we know from the adventures of mary poppins selfappointed carer to the banks children the selection of a nanny need not concern her employers while the fatheremployer is likely to know less than nothing about childcare in general or his own children in particular the mother being a neglectful feminist type like mrs banks who puts ambition before maternal feelings has forfeited any right to impose her own arrangements parents accustomed to controlling their personal lives may have difficulty with this armslength approach many mothers carried away by selfimportance are apt to think that during their absence the desired substitute is someone safe experienced and to them likeable with whom they share at least some ideas about bringing up children with this in mind and in the absence of any police checks on nannies they will begin their first search for a nanny only after the earnest study of books on nannyinterviewing technique which means that potential employees will be subjected to many gruelling hours of supposedly artless interrogation on everything from religious observance blood transfusions to family background work ethic to views on smoking sweets eating disorders and chastisement psychopath the child will be presented for handling is the nanny too formal too kissy strangely awkward it does not help of course if the child for they do occasionally have views should subsequently express a vehement dislike of this stranger for those summoned for a second interview the process becomes yet more intrusive women who are about to hand over their children to an unsupervised individual for nine or hours a day five days a week can be horribly nosy and captious because what they are searching for in return for their money whether they like it or not is a temporary extension of the family i have known a wellqualified candidate be rejected on a whim because of the frequency with which she said bless another had fatally for her chances expressed a preference for homeoepathic remedies over calpol others had blue hair or bo were too fat or too thin too pretty or too ugly too young or too old one who had impeccable references left the bathroom in an augean condition male applicants were lucky to be phoned back before long according to a report last weekend an extension of the race relations act will make such caprice illegal at least where there can be any question of racial discrimination a home office spokeswoman told the observer people will not be able to discriminate when it comes to employing nannies in their own homes in fact they will be able to discriminate like mad against a multitude of candidates against people who are irritating prying bossy thuggish affected pious loud suggestive snobbishnew agey antisemitic stroppy too clever too dim homophobic or anyone they just dont like the look of so long as they are white but in the event that a candidate who for whatever trifling personal reason has failed to appeal at interview should also belong to a different racial group then the act can be invoked and it will be up to an employer to prove that they are not racist if it were to be widely and impartially enforced the legislation could i suppose be a fabulous boost to britains prized tolerance and diversity safely distant from the world of nannyhiring i can see that it might be quite amusing for the daughter of say an agnostic couple of jewish descent to be raised by an orthodox muslim for a butchers child to be fed by a vegan for the child of a lesbian couple to be cared for by a bornagain believer who thinks nothing personal mind that they will burn in hell equally how refreshing it would be for a girl from an ethnic background that discourages any glimpse of female legs to be cared for by a cultural visitor from the world of casual sex and multiple piercings perhaps fearing that such innovations would not be universally popular the home office is reportedly discussing exemptions for those who can show a genuine occupational requirement for their discrimination in the home allowing for example an elderly muslim woman to have a muslim home help if so in the interests of fairness it should perhaps concede that parents semiintimate semiformal relationship with a nanny being quite singularly unlike any other also carries a genuine occupational requirement that they be allowed to reject anyone they like even when like the insufferable poppins that person is practically perfect birts laughaminute biog it may offer less sexual intrigue than ulrikas honest and is when compared

it wasnt much more than a week ago that the tories announced an end to their war against single parents this was tactical rather than practical i believe since it is customary for the end of a war to be announced by its winner the tories must have hoped thereby to persuade us that they had won whereas in fact by any measurable scale single parents must have won since its statistically impossible in this country to be less popular than the conservative party principal carers as lone parents are so nonjudgmentally known by the child support agency must have thought they would be given a short while to regroup and maybe hand out a few medals but no a new war has been launched almost immediately this time by the government itself poor carers they must feel like poland in an effort to make things fairer and faster the csa has announced a new scale to calculate the financial input of the nonresident parent the formula which was meant to be introduced in april but will not take effect until some time next year requires the absent parent to pay of his or her income for one child for two and for three this amounts to a cut in payments to single parents of up to but does not affect the ones who live on benefits therefore it is effectively a penalty on being a single parent with a job which is a little bit rich coming from a government that spent so much of its first term trying to get single parents back to work the csas position is that the system needs to be changed because it is unworkable at the moment it has some good evidence to support this claim in august it transpired that the agency had written off bn worth of debt and considered a further m uncollectable sir john bourne the auditor general estimated in july that of the csas maintenance assessments were wrong in other words this is the most comprehensively rubbish finance collection agency this country has ever seen if a lone parent failed at its quotidian duties this woefully it would have its children taken away so the quest for simplification and greater efficiency is understandable but when the end result is to round down the amount owed to the main carer you cant help thinking that behind this fiasco theres prejudice at work try to imagine what would happen if the inland revenue got most peoples tax assessments wrong wrote off vast quantities of its debts because it couldnt be bothered to chase them and then said sod it lets charge them all a bit less and see if that works well it would make the whole business of being taxed a lot more fun and we wouldnt be able to afford a war against iraq but on the downside society would disintegrate and we would all get cholera the decision is absolutely obscure it doesnt benefit the working single parent and ultimately it cannot benefit the government if the employed are to be penalised those on very low incomes will necessarily be forced out of work and back on the dole the only people gaining from this are the absent parents who are in effect being rewarded for the merry bn dance theyve led the csa on since its inception nine years ago of course this is infinitely worse than the nowdefunct tory war it doesnt make any difference to anyone whether or not the opposition party thinks they got pregnant just to get a council flat if anything the act of annoying norman tebbit might add to your overall quality of life the government scheme on the other hand has important and damaging financial ramifications but the thinking behind new labour and old tory is the same single parents are quite simply worth less than other groups they are worth less than dual parents they are worth less than the childless and most ridiculously they are worth less than absent parents their payments are chased less tenaciously than bloody parking fines they were harried back to work with the most patronising of poster campaigns and now they are penalised for being in work the very people who demonstrate their sense of social responsibility most assiduously are the ones who are treated with least respect by their society conceivably this all stems from a moral agenda that still puts some crazy value on marital respectability even though the only people who really stay married for life these days are politicians themselves and thats just because they have such ahem funpacked professional lives possibly there is a misogynist undertone here since though we all strive with modern evenhandedness not to group resident and absent parents by gender the former are still mainly women i wonder though whether it isnt all a bit more pragmatic than that lone parents are notoriously timepoor individuals being so busy with kids and whatnot if youre going to victimise anyone you may as well victimise the ones who

a government minister failed to release figures showing that single working mothers could lose an average of over a year under a new child support maintenance system it was revealed yesterday malcolm wicks parliamentary undersecretary at the department of work and pensions hid figures showing that a single working mother with one child would lose nearly of her maintenance income a working mother with two children would lose more than a year instead mr wicks claimed in a written parliamentary answer that the government could not work out firm average figures on losers and winners under a new assessment system the figures are damaging to the governments campaign to get mothers back to work since those staying on benefit and out of work would not lose such large sums the assessment calculations came to light after the liberal democrat works and pensions spokesman stephen webb used the data protection act to obtain confidential advice between the minister and his civil servants on answering a parliamentary question he had tabled to the minister these revealed that mr wicks had been sent a suggested reply revealing both the average child support maintenance assessment under the current system and the percentage changes when the new system comes into force this showed that single mothers would have to have at least three children before they would benefit by an average of a year under the change mr wicks replied it is not possible to make firm estimates of the change to the average payment in child support maintenance as a result of the introduction of the new child support scheme a minute from the civil servant said this is a delicate area we are conscious that we do not wish to draw unnecessary attention to it he added that release of the information may provide mr webb with fresh impetus to debate who will be betterworse off in the new scheme mr webb yesterday described the departments attitude as a cover up he added hardworking single parents struggling to hold down a job and look after their children alone will be significant losers under the new system the government claims that the shake up of the child support agency will introduce a fairer system the fact is that it will punish many lone parents a department spokeswoman defended mr wicks the figures that would have been published had already been released four years ago the minister tried to get uptodate figures to give to the mp but they were not available she said the advice from the civil servant to the minister had been inappropriate,2002-10,government minister

crown prosecutors are to be strongly urged today by the solicitor general to press ahead with domestic violence prosecutions even if the woman victim insists on the case being dropped she might want to forgive him but the next time he assaults her she could be killed the solicitor general harriet harman will tell an association of chief police officers conference on domestic violence ms harman will give her strongest backing yet to moves to give the victims of domestic violence the same anonymity as that offered to rape victims when they appear in court to give evidence the measures are part of a wider package in next months criminal justice bill which will see the systematic review of all murder cases involving domestic violence it also outlines new powers to impose restraining orders to keep the perpetrators away from their victims and make the breach of a nonmolestation order a criminal rather than a civil offence the legislation on domestic violence will be the first for years the latest official figures show that the police make an arrest in only of domestic violence cases and the arrest rate varies from to across police forces the solicitor general will tell todays conference that a decision on whether or not to drop a case when a woman says she will not support the prosecution is very difficult it is not just the issue of whether there will be enough evidence without her it is about where the public interest lies when the victim is insisting the case be dropped says ms harman prosecutors are right to remember always that the safety of the woman is paramount but they are considering a public not a private prosecution she might want to forgive him but the next time he assaults her she could be killed even if she has left him and wants just to move on in her life and put it all behind her he is likely unchecked to just go on to assault his next partner and she might end up dead the government wants to make clear to the victim of domestic violence that the assault is a crime and not a private matter just for themselves and their children at the same time it has to be made clear to the men involved that they are criminals if they assault their wives and girlfriends if you commit assault at home you are every bit as much a criminal as someone who assaults a stranger in the street ms harman says she will also give her strongest

most working fathers will not take time off to look after their children during half term this week because they think bosses discriminate against men showing any commitment to childcare according to a report today from the work foundation after researching attitudes in the workplace the employment thinktank found a widespread fear among men that sharing equally in parenting responsibilities will lead to career death the foundation said british workplace culture was set by a generation of corporate men in their s who had been supported by wives who stayed at home to raise their children at least in the preschool years they have woken up to the fact that they now employ mothers but few have paid attention to the consequence that this means they now employ a different kind of father the foundation said according to the governments labour force survey of married or cohabiting mothers with preschool children also hold down a job in many families that was forcing men to take on more domestic and caring duties but the implications for men have not yet registered on the corporate radar as a result men are nervous about taking paternity leave or asking for time off for flexible working to help them manage their childcare responsibilities they often prefer to parent by stealth for example using offsite client meetings to cover up for the time they spend looking after the children and avoid appearing uncommitted or less masculine in front of their colleagues richard reeves author of the report said equality at work and equality at home are intertwined until there is a redistribution of unpaid work towards men women will never be able to achieve full parity in the labour market the foundations findings were based on unpublished research by the equal opportunities commission showing that nearly twothirds of firms offered paternity leave but most fathers did not take it the eoc survey found the vast majority of fathers liked paternity leave being available but only a tiny minority thought they could take it without damaging their careers or earning potential next year fathers will get the right to two weeks paid paternity leave and employers will have a legal duty to consider requests for flexible working the eoc survey found fathers were just as keen as mothers to have access to flexible working but the men and women wanted different types of flexibility among fathers wanted the opportunity to work flexitime compared with of mothers of fathers wanted the chance to work a compressed week compared with of mothers and of fathers wanted the option to work from home compared with of mothers death knells for the institution of the family are premature according to a new study identifying a growing phenomenon of lifelong parenting writes lucy ward the family report published today by the social market foundation thinktank concludes that the family is not dying but simply changing and unveils research showing unprecedented numbers of

working fathers are treated even worse by their bosses than working mothers according to a new report which urges the government to bring in six months maternity leave for men men are resorting to stealth parenting spending more time with their children but inventing business meetings to cover absences from the office for fear that admitting to childcare responsibilities damages their careers one study involving dummy applications to take unpaid childcare leave found mens requests were more likely to be rejected than those of women according to the report by the work foundation thinktank for many fathers saying to a superior they cannot do a latenight meeting because they have to pick up the kids is fraught with difficulty the report adds some senior managers who are comfortable with female staff playing the family card recoil when their male colleagues do so the report dads army argues the government should scrap plans to give women six months extra maternity leave from next year and allow couples instead to choose whether the mother or father takes the leave which falls when the new baby is between six months and a year old creating such unisex leave would send a message that it is normal for men to be closely involved with their children it suggests the report says men are three decades behind women in tackling the dilemmas posed by being overlooked for promotion and pay rises mens fears that if they requested time off they would suffer for it appeared justified one headhunter warned that while firms were often fairly accommodating to women with childcare responsibilities it would be the kiss of death for a man to say he needed flexibility for this reason patricia hewitt the trade and industry secretary is concerned that fathers will not take advantage of new rights such as paternity leave unless they are sure their careers will not suffer from next april both men and women with young children will have new rights to request reduced or flexible

a greyhead in city recruitment once told me that when he began his career he was shown a list of six public schools any applicant who had attended one was in everyone else was out that attitude has gone the way of the bowler hat yet a paper in this months bulletin of economic research shows that graduates who went to independent schools are likely to earn more than those from state schools the higher the fees the more a pupil is likely to earn in later life school fees are a good investment but the paper is bad news for egalitarians and worse news for those who hope for a meritocratic society or think we have arrived at one why is equality still so intractable robin naylor of the university of warwick and a coauthor of the paper is reluctant to use the phrase old school tie it may be that a private sector education produces characteristics that are attractive in the labour market confidence in interviews might be an example the true explanation probably lies somewhere between these poles he says what money cant buy though is equality between the sexes independently educated girls may do better than their state school contemporaries but still cant match the financial success of privately educated boys on average men and women from independent schools earn more than their peers but some privately educated boys earn more than just as wellqualified boys from the state system gender inequality has been illegal for years as with the example of highearning public schoolboys there is no simple explanation it is always tempting to suggest that women tend to bunch in lowpaid jobs which drags down average womens wages but separate research from the equal opportunities commission shows that women graduates enter the job market on salaries lower than their male contemporaries ironically this generation of women is the first to have got better alevel results than the boys it does not appear to have done them much good,2002-10,greyhead city recruitment told

parents of young children whose request for flexible working is not properly considered by their employer should be entitled to compensation of up to a years pay the tuc urged today in a submission to the government the trade union organisation warned that the governments suggested compensation of four weeks pay would not put sufficient pressure on bad employers the government has been consulting on new regulations due to come into force next april aimed at making it easier for working parents with young or disabled children to have more flexible working arrangements the department of trade and industry has estimated that more than million people will be covered by the regulations and believes four out of five requests for flexible working will be granted but the tuc said it was worried that the regulations were too stacked against workers and urged the government to make changes to help staff alter their working hours bad employers will be happy to be taken to a tribunal as a cheap way of avoiding flexibility if compensation for breaching the regulations is set at four weeks pay said the tuc tuc general secretary john monks said sadly flexible working is currently a privilege only enjoyed by a handful of workers for far too many working parents just getting through the day is a challenge in itself they finish one job travel home only to start their second the minute they walk through the door some companies have long realised the benefits that come from allowing their staff to work flexibly working parents trying to work a full week yet not neglect their children are in danger of stress overload in most cases the simple introduction of a little flexibility can quite literally change their lives they feel less pressurised and the end result is almost always a more productive employee who feels more at ease with themselves and their work but for these regulations to work as they are intended and create a new climate where working parents arent frightened to ask to change the way they work and to know that when they do ask their requests are taken seriously changes need to be made a dti spokesman said we will carefully consider submissions made by all

three sparse rooms in a sexual health clinic hardly signal a revolution off a spotless corridor between a waiting room and a shower room is a small cupboard incongruously stocked with hot drink ingredients and surgical robes next door the mix of tea sympathy and forensic science is most stark a kitchenette and a couple of comfy chairs are divided only by a curtain from an austere examining chair for visitors to the haven in camberwell south london the capitals only sexual assault referral centre this mix of science and sympathy is vital in the history of reporting and investigating rape in britain the centre is truly radical gone is the agonising wait often for hours for a forensic doctor in a cold and frequently illmaintained rape suite in a police station where victims are unable to wash drink or urinate so that forensic evidence is preserved gone too is the added ordeal of reporting the details of rape to an officer with no expertise in investigating sexual offences and no special training which has bred the common perception of police attitudes to rape victims as highly sceptical and bullying gone that is for victims who report rape in one of the south london boroughs the treatment of people reporting rape in the rest of the capital remains subject to a postcode lottery with victims at the mercy of varying attitudes and care and unable to get followup treatment advice and counselling in the same place with only three similar models elsewhere in england and wales in newcastle upon tyne manchester and leicester standards in rape investigations nationally are variable but the inequalities in londons service at least are set to be remedied the metropolitan police has brokered a partnership with the nhs jointly to fund similar centres at st marys hospital in west london and the royal london in the east end at a cost of m each the new centres are due to open next april and the use of examination suites in police stations will be phased out the metropolitan police authority met has become so concerned at the relatively small number of convictions in rape cases that it is overhauling its approach in what it calls project sapphire launched last year sapphire is claimed to be the most comprehensive reform of rape investigation ever undertaken by the police reporting of rape is notoriously low prosecutions are lower still and convictions rare the haven is designed to address these issues victims are brought to the centre in unmarked police cars through an unmarked entrance there is only ever one victim in the centre at any one time and to ensure dna evidence is above challenge the centre is cleaned after each victim leaves members of the medical team are specialists in both this area of forensics and the way they question and approach victims the approach balances the criminal investigation with victim care says amanda price the havens manager anyone coming here will know that we take rape very seriously and that were not making any judgments she says we notice how smoothly the process of reporting goes if you have a specialist team the centre generates more awareness and expertise and that generates greater disclosure most victims choose to accept the offer of followup appointments after their initial visit to the centre this is likely to reflect the fact that the process is not intrusive kate armitage a doctor and sexual offences examiner at the haven says we only ask questions that are relevant to the investigation and as far as sexual history goes we only need to know for forensic reasons if a woman has had sex in the previous two weeks though the centre was set up and is funded by the met victims who have learned of it by word of mouth can refer themselves for examination and treatment without having reported the crime forensic evidence can be taken if they should later decide to do so and victims who are considering going to the police can talk informally to an officer at the centre however most of the referrals made since the centre opened in june have been from police officers there remains much more to be done if the met is to improve rape investigation and victim care admits detective sergeant james stokley a member of the sapphire team the project has established dedicated hour sexual offences investigation teams in of the london boroughs averaging six sexual offence investigation soit officers these uniformed but specially trained police arrange a medical and forensic examination and take the victims initial statement stokley compares the role of soit officers to family investigating officers in a murder case or dedicated teams in community safety units investigating hate crimes soit officers should be the only police contacting the haven and accompany a victim to the centre on arrival the officer should explain the case to the doctor to avoid the victim having to repeat the details however some experts are concerned that soit officers may not always be available hours a day and that some victims still have to report to uniformed officers not specialised in dealing with sexual offences as part of sapphire front desk staff in police stations who are often civilians have been trained in how best to talk and respond to rape victims measures are also under way to improve intelligence on rape with a plan to track cases to understand why they fail to reach prosecution or conviction and to target linked sex offences and enhance public awareness of rape through campaigns such as those on minicab rape and drug rape stokley says that sapphire has managed to exceed the mets target of judicial disposal rates when a rape suspect is charged and raised the status of work on the crime sapphire has put rape at the forefront of policing officers take pride in what theyre doing the improvement he says is phenomenal when measured against the notorious tv documentary showing thames valley police bullying a woman who had reported rape the majority of rapes occur within the home stokley stresses stigma and fear inhibit women from coming forward its all about confidence he says theres a perception that people wont be believed or that its their fault we want people to come forward we want the figures of reported rape to go up its not satisfactory that so few women report it liz kelly professor of sexualised violence at london metropolitan university and director of the child and woman abuse studies unit at the university of north london is a member of the police authoritys independent advisory group iag on reporting and investigating rape she says the met is the only police service to have made rape a priority rapes largely dropped off the policy agenda sapphire happened because there are senior met officers who really care about the issue however kelly would still like to see improvements in investigation theyve dealt with the structures for victim support but have not yet done enough to address why cases are being lost before they reach the cps she says they can still make a difference on collecting evidence merlyn nuttall a rape survivor and member of the iag argues that the haven is long overdue but not nearly enough she wants every victim to have access to a centre like the haven its just ludicrous that its a postcode lottery she says there should be no barriers between victims and adequate places for them to go against the odds home office research estimates that one in women has experienced some form of sexual victimisation including rape however only one in victims reports it to the police with fewer than a quarter of allegations resulting in a suspect being charged the odds of a rapist facing a court are one in over the past years there has been a continuing and unbroken increase in reporting to the police but the number of convictions has remained fairly static the biggest proportion of lost cases fall at the earliest stage with between half and twothirds not reaching the point of referral to prosecutors according to research commissioned by the crown prosecution service inspectorate according to this years british crime survey women aged are more likely to say they have been sexually victimised than are older women most rapes take place in the victims own home and women are most likely to be attacked by their partner of cases strangers were responsible for only of rapes reported

britains prosperity will suffer if the government does not come up with new money to help women scientists and engineers back to work after having children a report warned yesterday the report commissioned by the trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt and drawn up by lady greenfield director of the royal institution called for state funding for fellowship schemes to enable women who have taken family career breaks to retrain and update their skills besides traditional problems of sexism women scientists and engineers particularly in academia are vulnerable in the highly competitive fastmoving world of research scientists are judged on the number of research papers they publish in academic journals so taking time out to start a family exposes women to the feared publications gap which counts against them when they try to pick up their careers the number of women getting phds in the biosciences chemistry engineering and technology has risen significantly in the past few years while the number of men has fallen the number of women in science engineering and technology jobs has gone up from to in the past decade but the report found institutional sexism a career system not in tune with families and the glass ceiling remained to block progress particularly at the top level of science if the number of women was just going to drift up we would see more women in senior positions its just not happening said jan peters of the natural environment research council one of the scientists who drew up the report lady greenfield who is also professor of synaptic pharmacology at oxford university said we are past the bottompinching stage its not so much someone being overtly rude to your face as you feeling that people are prejudiced against you its institutional sexism nancy lane of cambridge universitys zoology department said nobodys rude nobodys unkind they simply ignore you she recalled a male professor saying to a female colleague dont you worry your pretty little head about that the report tells the story of a distinguished academic who happened to be the only female member of a senior international science committee in april this year its chairman said she would add some glamour to the discussion even back in almost a half of britains bioscience graduates were women yet women make up only of bioscience professors today suggesting thousands of promising careers have fallen by the wayside another of the reports authors gill samuels a director of science policy at the pharmaceutical company pfizer warned women had to be tacticians in the lab its important women learn how to deal with sexism men may not know they are being offensive they may think its just joshing in a team setting lady greenfield said she expected the government to come up with money to fund the reports recommendations i think they will be obliged to put their money where their mouth is she said ms hewitt said the government would publish its response to the report shortly increasing the number of women scientists and engineers is vital for future uk competitiveness and productivity she said successful british companies increasingly depend

catherine davies an office manager in tunbridge wells says the chancellors latest moves to improve access to childcare are too little too late mrs davies pregnant with her second child due in april said she will be forced out of work because of childcare costs in prosperous tunbridge wells statefunded nurseries are hard to find and private nurseries cost too much it wont make sense for me to carry on working i paid a term last time round for childcare and its gone up a lot since i reckon that after childcare i would bring home about a week that would be for working hours a week dropping my new child at a nursery and taking alannah her eldest daughter to school most other mothers i know around here are in exactly the same position most of them are giving up work once they have a child said mrs davies in yesterdays speech the chancellor promised new tax incentives to encourage employers to set up workplace nurseries but mrs davies said that was unlikely to benefit her i work for just a small company with less than employees its a good idea but i know that when other mothers have approached the company about it its not been possible small companies just cant afford it and i dont think some small changes in tax will make much difference what about the much trumpeted new integrated child tax credit wont that at least help out again mrs davies said she was unlikely to gain anything as her husband who works in the city is in the higher rate tax band and their total household income is above we have never even bothered to apply for these tax credits the forms are incredibly long and its highly unlikely that we would get anything but there was some support for the chancellor mrs davies said she firmly approves of the changes to paternity rights i like the idea that my husband will be able to attend antenatal appointments with me previously it would have meant him having to take a days holiday nick catherines husband added we will be worse off due to the impact of the national insurance increase and we dont benefit from any incentives because i earn to much we are too welloff to get any help but too poor to afford expensive private childcare i see

good news about womens pay is rare so it is a welcome change to see a statistic showing women outpacing men the chartered institute of managements annual survey of management salaries reveals that the remuneration of women directors rose by between and and while that of men at a similar level increased by better still statistically at least slightly lower down the hierarchy women managers averaged a increase against mens but these figures may represent a snapshot of how various sectors of the economy are doing rather than a positive social trend the institute itself acknowledges that the discrepancy may be accounted for by the fact that the public sector where the majority of senior women managers work has grown over the past year while the more buccaneering sectors of private enterprise where bluechip boardrooms remain maledominated have had a dismal time more significant still is that over the past two years the culture of city bonuses has withered this has been as a result of the collapse of the boom in mergers and takeovers which dominated the s and drove up the eyewatering bonuses of some financial professionals it was the sometimes blatantly unfair distribution of bonuses rather than inequalities of salary that accounted for women earning less than men in financial institutions and after the public sector the financial sector is the biggest employer of senior women managers another factor is that although manufacturing is in recession the service sector continues to grow senior managers in manufacturing are mostly men while the service sector is more willing to promote women or to be fair has a larger base of women employees from which to find management material while the gap between mens and womens remuneration remains wide at all levels and even average rises of are not enough to see women overtaking men yet the shift of emphasis to service in public and private sectors could help to develop a more level playing field bill

rape crisis services in britain are on the verge of collapse throwing into question the effectiveness of last weeks legislation designed to boost the rape conviction rate of the centres offering help and support to victims of rape across the country seven have closed in the past months while one of britains biggest and most active centres is fighting closure were delighted that legislation is going to be tightened but most women wont get the advantage of the new legislation unless they have somewhere to go to help them report the crime in the first place said helen jones of the rape crisis federation of england and wales who spent two years sitting on the home office consultation group debating the changes in the law the new legislation welcome as it is brings its own problems because it has encouraged people to think that because the issue has been nationally recognised crisis groups are no longer at risk rape convictions are down in britain from per cent in to per cent in and already victims needing help and advice face a lottery with no centres in the south west and nothing north of cumbria there are only two centres in wales and just three in and around london the situation will soon get worse if create britains biggest rape crisis centre in cleveland which is approached by over victims of rape each each year loses its battle for funds hopefully the governments new legislation will encourage more women to report their ordeals said alison harris the groups chair but that means more support and counselling will be needed and the importance of organisations such as ours cant be underestimated half of britains remaining rape crisis groups exist on less than a year raised entirely from donations and operate without any paid workers at all while one in five continues to function with less than lack of funding is severely hampering groups that continue to operate as lizzie not her real name discovered when she was raped last month by a man she met at a party i wanted to go to the police but before i could bring myself to do that i needed basic information about what that would entail said the yearold events organiser from north london i spent two days trying to find someone to tell me what i needed to know i trawled the internet and the phone book for the numbers of crisis groups but despite ringing organisations i found their numbers had either been suspended didnt work or went automatically on to answerphone i almost gave up if it took me two days to get information what was it going to be like when i did go to the police rape crisis groups admit that the lack of funding severely damages their ability to help clients kim thomas head of the women and girls network the only active group in central london receives calls a year but

britains supposedly loutish lads seem to be fast turning into loving dads as michael owen announced this week that at he will soon follow fellow england star david beckham into the labour ward the only bottle todays young men are reaching for apparently is one with a teat on top this impression is backed up by a new survey on the mating habits of young british males researchers at essex university found that despite an infamous reputation as serial shaggers they are in fact five times more likely than their italian contemporaries to have settled down by so what is happening has the loaded generation gone soft possibly unless we are simply waking up to a longhidden phenomenon celebrity has done a service by casting its limelight on a largely invisible side of fatherhood what michael douglas and david jason reveal about the wrinkly end of the paternal experience michael owen is doing for boy dads the truth is there have always been lots of them its one reason why britain has such a high teenage pregnancy rate six times higher than in the netherlands one statistic is telling a quarter of all young men entering young offender institutions are or are about to become fathers but fatherhood in young men is largely ignored or overlooked because they lack traditional qualifications job home money we dont rate them as dads men like jude though challenge the stereotype of the feckless lad two years ago when he was just jude became fulltime dad to his son rushaun then three months old his girlfriend was no longer around jude from south london had no job no home of his own and no money in the past rushaun might have been adopted yet today he is with his dad who remains out of work and lives in a sparsely furnished council flat as the eldest in his own family jude has advantages im used to caring for my brothers and sisters he says im young so rushaun learns more from me and its easier to be a role model i have my youth and energy i have time to do what rushaun enjoys i can see life growing in him every little advancement but it has not all been easy its taken me two years to get the feel for being a father he admits ive had to look around and take it all in at first i felt like an alien im the oldest of seven so my mum has six others to cope with and cant do that much for us i have to do it by myself powerful celebrity role models such as beckham help young fathers like jude feel less of an alien beckham of course has no problem with the breadwinner bit but his distinguishing characteristic is his public endorsement of caring fatherhood for a young dad perhaps with little else to offer this can be a liberation celestine agbo who has worked with young dads for over years recognises beckhams importance during this years world cup he established a young fathers group i put an advert in the paper for meetings of a david beckham supporters club he recalls i got a few phone calls it turned out that six nearly half the people who rang were young men with children once i asked them about their kids they got really excited about discussing them i think it is because often when young dads get into relationships no one wants them to talk about their kids so it is refreshing for them rushaun is however a lucky child just of teenage fathers remain in touch with the mothers years later it means that children born to a teenage dad this year will not be seeing him by the time they themselves are teenagers does this matter to the child hugely according to recent findings by professor judy dunn at the institute of psychiatry a close relationship between an estranged father and his child is highly beneficial to a childs development particularly when the mother became pregnant as a teenager it is easy to see how it all goes wrong about a third of new dads are reluctant parents reports fatherhood reclaimed by adrienne burgess a survey of found that nearly half had never discussed starting a family with their partners these figures are even higher among younger men and strongly predict relationship breakdown even willing young dads quickly become alienated says celestine agbo he starts out feeling whoa great im a man shes having my baby theres excitement he has romantic ideas about what he and his son they always think it will be a son will do together but gradually he feels redundant she goes back to her mum theyre doing the shopping getting the clothes ready it gets like christmas there is a lot of pressure and his partner may be angry with him he goes on especially if he is not working she may decide she doesnt need him some young dads tell me they have to pay to see their child clearly young mothers cannot be expected to support partners through a transition into fatherhood if there is outside help though it can make a huge difference not only to the mothers and the childs prospects but to the young mans new research from bristol university suggests that young fatherhood far from being problematic can bring young disadvantaged men the very ones who are cropping up repeatedly in crime statistics out of social exclusion as fatherhood confers the status and achievement work once provided lads can turn into dads the bristol study quotes brian when katy became pregnant with jimmy obviously there is still a part of me that thinks like youre young and all that he says but ive got to be prepared not to see my mates and not spend me money at the start of the month and then go skint for the rest with a baby you cant do that youve got to make sure there is enough in the bank so were going to have to grow up pretty quickly but i respect that there is someone going to be calling me daddy you know after the birth life got more difficult with housing and work as i work shifts i cant really help in the evenings as jimmy will be in bed when i get home explains brian so its every other week that i can help out i go over every night and see katy as katy shares a room with jimmy i cant have an alarm clock going off and waking him early because she would have to cope with him once id gone to work its all changed since this new job i used to be able to help with bottles and everything saw him every night then it was nice but the money wasnt there brians story highlights a problem with the way government and society champion a work culture to the detriment of the caring side of fatherhood the state has yet to appreciate the potential of young fathers summed up by michael owens words ive had a few exciting moments in my career but nothing that compares to how i felt when louise told me the news given such enthusiasm why is it according to the bristol research that antenatal staff largely ignore young dads why did half the health visitors interviewed know little or nothing about the young fathers they were meant to support the example of michael owens public excitement may bolster some isolated young men like jude but as long as so many other people and institutions are ambivalent about his role and fail to offer a helping hand that figure of children losing their young dads by their teenage years is unlikely to fall jack osullivan is a cofounder of

men accused of rape will no longer be able to get off by arguing that they honestly believed a woman was consenting however unreasonable that belief might have been the government has listened to womens organisations which have campaigned for years for reform of the honest belief defence the defence has been available since when the house of lords ruled in the case of morgan v the director of public prosecutions that a mans genuine belief that the woman was consenting was a defence to a rape charge even if the belief was unreasonable in the circumstances morgan had invited three strangers to have sex with his wife telling them she liked to struggle to get turned on the men were convicted but appealed eventually to the house of lords the convictions were upheld but the lords ruled by a threetwo majority that there could be no rape conviction if a man honestly believed a woman had given her consent and that his belief did not have to be reasonable the honest belief defence was one of the most contentious issues tackled by the interdepartmental working party which recommended farreaching changes to sex offences law in july to the disappointment of many it decided to keep morgan while trying to fetter inappropriate use of honest belief a man would not be able to claim honest belief if he had made himself drunk failed to take all reasonable steps to ascertain that the woman was freely agreeing or was reckless as to whether she was consenting more than half of those responding to the recommendations however wanted to scrap morgan altogether and the government has listened to their voices the white paper proposes that where the prosecution can prove that there is reasonable room for uncertainty about the complainants consent and that the defendant did not take reasonable action in the circumstances to ensure that the complainant was willing to take part in the sexual acts rape will be proved this introduces a new test of reasonableness to be judged by what an objective third party would think in the circumstances in deciding whether the defendant acted reasonably the jury would have to take into account the actions of both parties the circumstances in which they placed themselves and the level of responsibility exercised by both the government hopes to make the issue clear by including in the statute a nonexhaustive list of circumstances in which consent is presumed to be absent where the victim was subjected to force or fear of force threatened or put in fear of serious harm to herself or another person abducted or unlawfully detained unconscious unable to communicate consent because of physical disability or had agreement given by a third party the new law would make it clear that children under were incapable of giving consent to any sexual activity and any sexual activity with someone incapable of consenting because of a learning disability or mental disorder would be an offence,2002-11,men accused rape longer able get

yesterdays white paper on sex offences with a bill to follow in the new year passes the first two tests that any legislation should face is is necessary has it been well thought out the answer is yes to both questions there has been no consolidation of sexual offences for years even then the act was mainly a pulltogether of thcentury laws the current law is a patchwork of court rulings old statutes and sudden responses to important reports like wolfenden on the decriminalisation of homosexuality in private in the result is an archaic and contradictory jumble a man who has unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under faces a twoyear sentence but a man who indecently assaults her without sexual penetration faces years there are different age threshholds time limits and even different offences according to whether a sexual assault is on a boy or girl is it well thoughtout yesterdays white paper is not a kneejerk response to tabloid allegations by ulrika jonsson or anyone else it is the culmination of four years work including a review committee extensive consultation and special conferences that ended with a wellbalanced page document two years ago yesterdays policy paper follows the main thrust of the earlier work it does not seek to intervene in private relationships between consenting adults but it proposes important reforms on rape gay sex and sexual abuse ministers should be congratulated for reforming such sensitive laws which their predecessors did not dare to touch rape social reformers are rightly concerned by the dramatic drop in convictions in the last years from to much of this is probably caused by the rise of date rape ministers have resisted making date rape a lesser charge rightly so since the effects can be as traumatic as stranger rape instead they are tightening the rules that currently allow defendants to plea an honest belief in consent even where this is unreasonable they are widening the law to include penile penetration of the anus and mouth and they reject tabloid pressure to give defendants the same anonymity that victims have rightly been given gay sex here the law was in its most archaic and discriminatory form the review rightly referred to the way in which the laws language unnatural acts and buggery helped to legitimise prejudice and encourage homophobia homosexual and heterosexual activity is to be put on an equal footing homosexuals will no longer be pursued for cruising which in the heterosexual world would be regarded as chatting up but like heterosexuals gays will be prosecuted if they have sex in view of the public or solicit sex in a manner that causes public anxiety sex abuse the rules of the sex offender register which already achieves compliance will be tightened but there will be no sarahs law giving public access to it because that leads to lynch law and offenders going to ground where they can not be monitored there will be new laws with severe penalties for sexually exploiting children for gain or grooming children for sex on internet chat sites one rare omission is the dropping of a proposed persistent sexual abuse act which will rightly cause concern among childrens charities most sexual abuse remains in the home the old incest law however will be widened to include adoptive and step relations it is a good package it got a progressive response from tory mps

two victorian scandals shaped britains sex laws which have remained in place for more than years and under which oscar wilde and john gielgud were prosecuted and thousands of other men are still arrested each year an overhaul of the laws on sexual offences has not been attempted since and even the sexual offences act of that year was a consolidation of the victorian statutes and passed without real debate there has been some reform since then including the decriminalisation of homosexuality in private in changes to the law on rape and increased protection for children but much of the law still dates back to the criminal law amendment act the first scandal was triggered when the crusading journalist wt stead revealed the white slave traffic at the heart of the british empire he was jailed for showing it was possible to buy a yearold girl for sex in london the scandal led to legislation raising the age of consent for girls from to but the bill was ambushed by henry labouchere a republican liberal mp who proposed it should also make any form of sex between men a crime anal sex had been illegal since the reign of henry viii but his amendment extended punishment to any act of gross indecency there was little debate the main concern was that it might become a blackmailers charter and the legislation did not criminalise lesbianism hansard records that when one peer tried to raise the issue he was told to shut up on the grounds that he would only advertise its existence to an impressionable public the new law unleashed a wave of homophobic witchhunts which began with the sensational cleveland street scandal of it was revealed that two peers of the realm lord arthur somerset and lord euston and it was claimed prince eddy the son of the prince of wales had visited a male brothel in london where post office telegram delivery boys were corrupted at four shillings a time the scandal cemented public support for the legislation the trial and imprisonment of oscar wilde for gross indecency followed in amid an intense newspaper campaign against the buggers although the number of offences has fallen there were cases of buggery reported to the police last year

reports that the government plans to introduce tax relief for working parents who employ nannies have been a little exaggerated they have also caused a division of opinion among the lobby groups who campaign for better childcare provision what is at issue is the claim that fees paid for the childcare of working parents is income that is taxed twice once when the parent earns it and again when the parent takes responsibility for the carers tax and contributions including an employers ni contribution the problem of managing two tax returns for one income is usually confined to professional women who earn enough to be able to employ a domestic nanny rather than using a pooled childminder or if they are lucky a nursery school nevertheless it is a problem that binds them in spirit to all working mothers who resent having to forfeit a substantial chunk of their wages to go to work in the first place when early in the last labour government the chancellor changed the status of workplace creches so they were no longer a taxable benefit there was optimism that the principle had achieved acceptance and hope that tax relief on childcare might follow the governments latest concession concerns working tax credits wtcs devised to encourage those on benefits into work wtcs have always included provision for childcare but only at approved nurseries or childcare centres from next april they will become slightly more flexible over the kind of childcare provision that can be used this is to allow parents more flexibility to work unusual hours which might make a day centre of limited use the money will have to be spent with an approved childcarer and cannot necessarily be passed to a grandmother or sister this is also a benefit rather than an allowance there is a sliding scale in other words it is meanstested it is part of the government strategy to have of single parents working by no one could resent assistance to families living in poverty but there is resentment that

three childrens charities are calling for an increase in the number of home visits by midwives and health visitors and for their services to form the major plank of a universal parenting programme the nspcc the national family and parenting institute nfpi and the british association for the study and prevention of child abuse and neglect want the expansion of programmes that support parents to be made a government priority health visiting and midwife services are not developed to their full potential says chris cloke the nspccs head of child protection awareness the numbers of visits they are making has declined because of a decline in funding and staff shortages but an evaluation of home visiting services in the us demonstrates their value in delivering an important element of parenting programmes the charities want the government to devise a national strategic approach to parenting support that involves the nhs social services and the voluntary sector the current service is ad hoc and mainly funded by the health service which has no incentive to fund programmes because it doesnt pick up the bill when families fall apart says cloke we need a targeted and consistent service with the flexibility to respond to individual needs in response to a green paper on children at risk expected early next year the charities will recommend that the government introduces universal parenting programmes for families with children of all ages an nfpi survey last year suggested that families of children under five were twice as likely to receive services such as sure start as were families of those aged five to,2002-11,three childrens charity calling increase number home visit midwife health visitor service form major plank universal parenting programme nspcc national family parenting institute nfpi british association study prevention child abuse neglect want expansion programme support parent made government priority health visiting midwife service developed full potential say chris cloke nspccs head child protection awareness number visit making ha declined decline funding staff shortage evaluation home visiting service u demonstrates value delivering important element parenting programme charity want government devise national strategic approach parenting support involves nh social service voluntary sector current service ad hoc mainly funded health service ha incentive fund programme doesnt pick bill family fall apart say cloke need targeted consistent service flexibility respond individual need response green paper child risk expected early next year charity recommend government introduces universal parenting programme family child age nfpi survey last year suggested family child five twice likely receive service sure start family aged five,"['three', 'childrens', 'charity', 'calling', 'increase', 'number', 'home', 'visit', 'midwife', 'health', 'visitor', 'service', 'form', 'major', 'plank', 'universal', 'parenting', 'programme', 'nspcc', 'national', 'family', 'parenting', 'institute', 'nfpi', 'british', 'association', 'study', 'prevention', 'child', 'abuse', 'neglect', 'want', 'expansion', 'programme', 'support', 'parent', 'made', 'government', 'priority', 'health', 'visiting', 'midwife', 'service', 'developed', 'full', 'potential', 'say', 'chris', 'cloke', 'nspccs', 'head', 'child', 'protection', 'awareness', 'number', 'visit', 'making', 'ha', 'declined', 'decline', 'funding', 'staff', 'shortage', 'evaluation', 'home', 'visiting', 'service', 'u', 'demonstrates', 'value', 'delivering', 'important', 'element', 'parenting', 'programme', 'charity', 'want', 'government', 'devise', 'national', 'strategic', 'approach', 'parenting', 'support', 'involves', 'nh', 'social', 'service', 'voluntary', 'sector', 'current', 'service', 'ad', 'hoc', 'mainly', 'funded', 'health', 'service', 'ha', 'incentive', 'fund', 'programme', 'doesnt', 'pick', 'bill', 'family', 'fall', 'apart', 'say', 'cloke', 'need', 'targeted', 'consistent', 'service', 'flexibility', 'respond', 'individual', 'need', 'response', 'green', 'paper', 'child', 'risk', 'expected', 'early', 'next', 'year', 'charity', 'recommend', 'government', 'introduces', 'universal', 'parenting', 'programme', 'family', 'child', 'age', 'nfpi', 'survey', 'last', 'year', 'suggested', 'family', 'child', 'five', 'twice', 'likely', 'receive', 'service', 'sure', 'start', 'family', 'aged', 'five']",60
the spokeswoman from the department for education and skills sounded hurt she was most disappointed that childcare campaigners did not recognise the governments unprecedented commitment this weeks plan from the prime ministers strategy unit certainly boasts some big numbers in bn is being spent on classes for preschoolers childcare for undereights and sure start the programme for deprived children in addition mplus is being spent on tax credits to help parents pay for care labour has already delivered free preschool education for all fouryearolds and ought soon to offer the same for threeyearolds childrens centres offering medical services and family support are due to open in poor districts why then is the government not getting much kudos why was the response of daycare trust and other campaigners this week so curmudgeonly in part the answer is that the government has played fast and loose with the evidence we know little about what is provided where the chart apparently shows welcome expansion one childcare place per children by a huge improvement on s ratio of one per nine children but the projections for and conflate full and parttime places ask a mother working in a fulltime job how useful parttime care is labours child policy also suffers from initiativitis heres a teaser for anoraks why does the strategy unit make no mention of childrens trusts the latest administrative wheeze for coordinating health schooling and child protection the answer is that health secretary alan milburn is shortly to make a big announcement and he is damned if he is going to be scooped but there is a deeper reason why labour for all its efforts lacks credibility what it is offering is supposed to be both universal available to all parents but also targeted on poorer households especially the lone parents the government is keen to see working outside the home it is not putting up enough money to do the former properly but lacks the political courage just to concentrate on the latter six out of mothers with a child aged under five now have jobs over the past four decades the proportion of men of working age in jobs has fallen while womens paid work has expanded four out of women of working age have dependent children many families as a result face a daily struggle to find someone to look after their children while they are at work families often being a euphemism for mothers the problem is both undersupply of places and high cost reliable and stimulating care takes reasonably paid staff the government is rightly putting a lot into better training but keeps mum about the need to pay childcare workers more before the famously familyfriendly tories did little or nothing childcare was deemed to be a private matter on taking office labour accepted two things one was that state intervention in the lives of poor children could improve their life chances the other was that womens employment was a precondition of prosperity tony blair could have done a lloyd george he could have said we are expanding the welfare state and recognising a state responsibility for all children out of school hours from the age of three onwards that could have led to state nurseries everywhere a comprehensive service for all parents rich and poor instead labour typically tried to address the problem by stealth its formula was a bit of bribery for private sector providers here a dollop of cash for councils there never quite letting on what it was doing the strategy unit report is encrusted in code school rolls are falling english primary schools have spare capacity why not use this space for preschoolers and afterhours provision the report coyly asks the answer is that this would entail a reversal of the policy of giving schools more autonomy and might upset teachers daycare trust highlights another flaw in the grand strategy lately we have heard a lot about the new localism labours wish to let councils foundation hospitals and city academies get on with it free of the targets and tape in which they have been cocooned in childcare the strategy unit promises to give responsibility to local authorities but that is a recipe for big differences between different areas say the campaigners why is the london borough of hackney its population among the most needy closing nurseries the parents who most need help live in areas served by councils with the worst records as part of his efforts to get more lowincome people into lowincome jobs gordon brown conjured up subsidies tax credits intended to pay for childcare but the government has not done anything directly about supply instead it offers financial incentives for private profitmaking nurseries professor hilary land of bristol university compares the blairite approach to childcare with what has happened to care of the elderly in the early s twothirds of places in old peoples homes were public sector now seven out of are private sector the supply of places has fallen and care workers are poorly trained and paid if the government thinks the private sector will deliver childcare she concludes it is wrong that figure for in the chart turns out to rest on a

the government today paved the way for a hand over of responsibility for its key childcare programmes to local councils with a downing street unit warning that this was the only way for the government to deliver its ambitious promises on poverty the prime ministers strategy unit is calling for the flagship sure start programme in particular to be devolved to local government the programme widely regarded as successful aims to provide child support and development services for children aged under four and their parents in some of the most deprived areas of england the plans to give more power to councils are designed to end the current confusion over who is responsible for delivering childcare and to rationalise the plethora of funding arrangements ministers have put in place the strategy unit report calls on the government to join up its policy by handing more power to local councils it says clarity in the role of the local authority should facilitate the joining together of services and programmes at the local level delivery of the governments vision will also require local authorities over time to extend their remit to take responsibility for delivering sure start programmes currently managed from the centre particularly where such services are being integrated with childcare and early years education on the ground the strategy unit also wants to see the local partnerships of childcare providers councils businesses and regeneration organisations that were set up in to deliver the governments national childcare strategy to be pushed into a secondary role subordinate to councils it complains that accountability for childcare is unclear because the partnerships have no legal status or bank account the report suggests making local government chief executives directly responsible for the sure start scheme the strategy unit report also sets out how the government plans to use the extra money allocated in this years threeyear spending review to deliver at least new childcare places by and to create new childrens centres to provide care family support and health services in one place the prime minister today welcomed the publication the measures detailed in this report represent good news for children giving them a better start in early education and health so that they can increase their potential,2002-11,government today paved way

at last four months after the chancellor gordon brown gave us an outline the detail of the governments longpromised crosscutting review of childcare is now available since july baroness cathy ashton the minister in charge of the new interdepartmental childcare unit in the department of education and skills has had a title but no job the strategy unit report delivering for children and families provides her with a mission except her task turns out to involve handing over childcare to local authorities and effectively ending the pioneering sure start programme for disadvantaged children in rundown areas through its national childcare strategy and various early years and outofschool initiatives the blair government can rightly claim to have put the question of providing for children outside the confines of formal schooling firmly on the policy map it can also claim to be putting serious money into childcare outside the home after in july mr brown added considerably more but the document from the strategy unit which carries the imprimatur of the prime minister himself shows that the government has failed to make up its mind on two critical questions one is about selectivity who is the childcare intended for an option was to create a universal childcare service just as in denmark or france or other european countries there parents at both ends of the income scale expect the state to provide subsidised nursery care somewhere in their locality instead what the blair government seems to have gone for is a service for poorer parents in deprived wards heavy emphasis has been placed especially by mr brown on childcare that will allow single parents to go to work sure start was confined to a strictly delimited number of poor districts the proposed childrens centres will again be available only in areas characterised by low incomes and high social need that is what you might expect a social democratic government to do but there are problems what about poorer parents asks national childcare charity the daycare trust what about poorer parents living in betteroff districts who get missed out and there is a political issue if you provide public services for the betteroff middle classes as well as the poor you are more likely to enlist the sympathy of the middle classes and perhaps make them more likely to pay the necessary taxes to fund the service daycare needs unite mothers across the various income bands worklife balancing acts are possibly more unstable in middle class homes the governments message has been confused does it really expect the private market to take care of all the needs of families above a certain income in the past it has not and probably never could in the future the second question facing labour is how childcare is to be provided sure start was an initiative from the treasury it was centrally planned and operated on templates drawn up by naomi eistenstadt and her colleagues the national childcare strategy was precisely that a central government programme of course it had to be implemented locally but what resulted was a messy set of local agencies some inside the local authority some entirely voluntary the strategy unit report lists the confusing mass of partnership arrangements now along comes the government saying councils are to entirely take over responsibility for childcare including eventually sure start but councils vary tremendously in how much interest they take in preschool and outofschool provision they also vary in their capacity to deliver a nonmainstream programme such as childcare the strategy unit document says little about how much extra money will in future flow to councils through their revenue support grants but if it does not why should they bother with a programme they will say they cannot afford if extra cash does get through some councils will use the money for other purposes more fitting to their local sense of priority the london borough of hackney is closing nurseries adjacent to some of its poorest estates for local financial and political reasons councils will differ in their approaches but does the government really want more diversity in provision of a service that is already patchy the strategy unit report implies that by there will be more than enough childcare places to meet demand and certainly enough to ensure all single parents who want to work will not be impeded by a lack of access to care the trouble is those parents tend to live in local authority areas where councils find it hardest to provide quality services heres a prediction councils at the lower end of the audit commissions forthcoming comprehensive performance assessment will be those where the need for quality childcare is greatest the strategy unit simply ignores the problem of the variability of local authority services,2002-11,last four month chancellor gordon brown gave u outline detail government longpromised crosscutting review childcare available since july

it is a curious thing but the more that men and women do the same jobs the more their roles are assessed according to gender at the recent chartered institute of personnel and development cipd conference a fringe seminar stirred up controversy by suggesting that men and women learn differently if you thought that such a view was outdated then apparently you would be wrong according to michael carroll a chartered counselling psychologist from right coutts an international change management consultancy it is an idea that has gained a lot of ground women are supposed to have a better command of what are called the softer skills such as communication which are currently highly prized by modern management men on the other hand are considered to be a troubled lot as carroll reminded his audience men make up of the prison population and account for of all suicides and their suicide rate has risen by over the past decade on average they live six years less than women but their lives are more crowded as well as being three times more likely to be alcoholics of men work long hours compared with of women yet there is no evidence that this catalogue of woes adds up to a future where men will be left behind it remains a fact that men still predominate in boardrooms and the senior echelons of the professions while it is fashionable to assume that men must adapt to a womens world a more hardheaded analysis would suggest that ambitious women should study male behaviour which brings us back to the point of the cipd seminar we should not fall into easy assumptions that any approach to learning is the right one roy bolton regional manager for right coutts admits wryly that gender is something of a smokescreen here what has really changed is the nature of training or rather its object which as often as not is to train employees to find work elsewhere in the wake of mergers and redundancies the organisation man is dead and in a world where only change is certain

working parents will be denied childcare because of delays in the vetting of new childminders and nurseries carried out by the schools watchdog ofsted carers have been forced to wait over a year for clearance in some cases thanks to a backlog that is now putting the governments promised expansion of childcare places in jeopardy pressure groups claimed yesterday delays in routine checks on existing carers could tempt parents to leave their children with minders who had not been properly cleared tory mps warned only just over half the new applicants to the watchdog which took over the job of inspecting childcare last autumn had even been visited by the end of september let alone cleared to start work according to ofsted figures released last week this is going to put the brakes on expansion said stephen burke of the daycare trust which campaigns for better childcare the crunch is for parents whose expectations are being raised about the level of provision the reality is going to be very different on the ground the news comes as downing streets troubleshooting strategy unit prepares to release a report on the childcare industry this month expected to examine why new nurseries are not springing up fast enough to meet needs ofsted blames part of the problem on delays caused by the criminal records bureau set up to check the records of people working with children but insiders say it has also been hit by teething troubles of its own particularly with computer systems crashing when inspectors try to file reports so far it has only inspected about half the existing nurseries and childminders now in business who require yearly checks the national childminding association ncma says childminders applying for a variation of their registration to take on extra duties also face delays if a childminder needs to vary the conditions of their registration because the parent has to go abroad on an emergency business trip and they need to have overnight care for the child that could take three weeks said gill haynes chief executive of the ncma it is that sort of sensitivity to the needs of parents which has actually got to be part of the regulatory system otherwise people will just buck the system and turn a blind eye the tories warned parents not be tempted to risk informal arrangements with childminders who had not been checked the government has a duty to set up a system which does what it is meant to do protect children but let professional people who are not going to pose any threat get on with their jobs said eleanor laing shadow education spokeswoman there is enormous demand from parents and lack of supply and this is simply bureaucracy holding things up there are enormous implications of a situation like this going wrong the government has promised thousands more childcare places by raising fears among childcare providers over whether ofsted will be able to cope the watchdog insists it will meet targets to get all new checks done by march there are good reasons why it takes quite a long time we need to make sure we do thorough checks said a spokeswoman,2002-11,working parent denied childcare delay vetting new

in may a year after sweeping to victory tony blair launched the governments national childcare strategy with a pledge to boost the quality affordability and availability of childcare central to the plan was a target to create one million childcare places by march to stand any chance of achieving this the government needed to recruit tens of thousands of new childcare workers but with less than months to go many experts including influential thinktank demos have begun to question whether the government can meet its deadline childcare in britain is still the most expensive in europe and although the government has introduced tax credits to help some families to pay for it prices are still rising inexorably as demand outstrips supply the typical cost of a nursery place for a child under two is now a year according to the daycare trust up on last year childminders are less expensive but a fulltime place would still typically cost nearly a year to tackle the shortage the government has launched recruitment drive after recruitment drive the biggest was an m advertising campaign launched in july which aims to attract new workers by but while recruitment seems to be rising for nurseries playgroups and outofschool clubs the number of childminders the most flexible of childcare workers so in theory the most useful to working parents is on the decline far from recruiting an extra or even new registered childminders all targets bandied about in the past few years we appear to have mislaid at least since from around childminders catering for up to children in england the numbers have fallen to around overall numbers for the uk are harder to come by but it seems clear that there are no more than in the uk while the number of nursery places has risen sufficiently to more than take up the slack nurseries tend to be more expensive they also tend to operate only within normal ninetofive monday to friday working hours that just doesnt suit a lot of parents says a spokeswoman for the national childminding association childminders by contrast are very flexible tend to work longer hours and can support shift workers childminding has always suffered from a high turnover according to surveys as many as threequarters say they started because they wanted to stay at home and care for their own children at the same time when these children reach school age parents frequently abandon childminding in favour of a betterpaid career a spokesperson for the department for education and skills dfes admits existing workers are leaving faster than it can register new ones but claims the trend is changing the fall in the number of childminders has been due to a variety of factors demographic changes have meant there are now fewer women with young children available to become childminders than years ago she says the government has piled m into startup grants to encourage more people to become registered childminders it has also secured m from the european social fund to help local authorities subsidise fees for childcare courses ongoing sustainability grants of up to a year are also available despite this only of childminders actually seem to be making a profit the governments childcare workforce survey shows that around a third of them break even each year while a small proportion make a loss the amount they charge for each child for a full fiveday week working eight till six every day can vary from to the average according to the ncma is this means a childminder with one child to look after would make just a year before expenses tax and national insurance however someone looking after six children the maximum a childminder is allowed to care for would make more than the government and the ncma are keen to attract more men into childminding mindful of the fact that for most women childminding is a shortterm lifestyle choice in just of registered childminders were men for the moment however childminding is likely to remain dominated by women who have preschool age children bad news for those looking for a fast rise in the number of available places but good news for mothers looking for a flexible way to earn money and bring up their children how you could become a registered childminder do i have to be registered to look after children yes if you look after children under eight for more than two hours a day on domestic premises other than the childs own home babysitters who look after children only between pm and am do not have to be registered neither do nannies how do i become a registered childminder attend a preregistration briefing run by your local council you will get information on training grants and the demand in your area at the end you will be given an application pack you will have to complete a local authority approved training course most las use the ncmas introduction to childminding practice icp course which runs for hours spread over a few days or several weeks they also insist on first aid training ofsted will carry out checks on your health and suitability to look after children as well as that of any assistant working for you it will also send an inspector to your home to check its suitability and to assess how many children you can care for you any assistants working for you and all overs living in your home also need to be checked out by the criminal records bureau before you get your registration certificate you must pay ofsted it will inspect you each year and will require an annual fee more details are available from ofsted

the ncmas developing childminding practice and extending childminding practice courses which follow on from the introduction to childminding practice training you should also qualify for at least a couple of hundred pounds worth of help to set up your business childminders in disadvantaged areas may also qualify for sustainability grants worth up to twice a year what should i charge childminders charges vary dramatically even within a few miles so it makes sense to check out the competition according to the ncma the average per child is just per hour although the charges it has found range from to an hour the ncma recommends negotiating a contract with parents not only agreeing on their childs routine but also on whether you will receive holiday pay you can either negotiate several weeks paid leave a year at full or reduced rate or agree for holiday to be unpaid but charge more the rest of the time to compensate what about insurance public liability insurance is essential to cover you in the event of injury to a child or damage to his or her belongings the ncma wwwncmaorguk offers up to million public liability cover as part of its membership package this also includes free legal representation and advice adding it to your home insurance is also an option and you should in any case inform your buildings and contents insurer that you are running a business from home norwich union charges to add on million of public liability insurance you will also need to extend your car insurance to cover business use insurance and other expenses can be offset against income

men accused of rape and sexual assault can no longer question their alleged victims in scottish courts under legislation which came into force yesterday the new law which is framed to make women less apprehensive about coming forward with rape allegations brings scotland in line with the rest of the uk but the measures go a step further than in england and wales in scotland an alleged victims sexual history can now only be brought up by defence lawyers if the defendants previous history of sexual offences is disclosed to the jury under the sexual offence procedure and evidence scotland act anyone charged with a sex offence will be required to appoint a solicitor or have one appointed by the court defence lawyers will also have to tell the court at least days before trial if they intend to bring up the victims sexual history if they do this the crown has the automatic right to disclose any previous convictions for sexual offences to the jury although the defence will be able to appeal to have this right waived the new law is likely to lead to many more cases in which the defendants criminal record is an issue than at present the legislation comes in the wake of a string of court cases in scotland where women were subjected to sustained and personal questioning by their alleged attackers the scottish justice minister jim wallace said the aim of this legislation is to reduce some of the fear that deters victims from coming forward he added the executive does not believe that victims should be subjected to intense often degrading questioning from the very person who is accused of abusing them sandy brindley spokeswoman for glasgow rape crisis welcomed the act but said more needed to be done to increase the conviction rate its not going to fully address the concerns that are there about the justice system she said,2002-11,men accused rape sexual assault longer question alleged victim scottish court legislation came force yesterday new law framed make woman less apprehensive coming forward rape allegation brings scotland line rest uk measure go step england wale scotland alleged victim sexual history brought defence lawyer defendant previous history sexual offence disclosed jury sexual offence procedure evidence scotland act anyone charged sex offence required appoint solicitor one appointed court defence lawyer also tell court least day trial intend bring victim sexual history crown ha automatic right disclose previous conviction sexual offence jury although defence able appeal right waived new law likely lead many case defendant criminal record issue present legislation come wake string court case scotland woman subjected sustained personal questioning alleged attacker scottish justice minister jim wallace said aim legislation reduce fear deters victim coming forward added executive doe believe victim subjected intense often degrading questioning person accused abusing sandy brindley spokeswoman glasgow rape crisis welcomed act said needed done increase conviction rate going fully address concern justice system said,"['men', 'accused', 'rape', 'sexual', 'assault', 'longer', 'question', 'alleged', 'victim', 'scottish', 'court', 'legislation', 'came', 'force', 'yesterday', 'new', 'law', 'framed', 'make', 'woman', 'less', 'apprehensive', 'coming', 'forward', 'rape', 'allegation', 'brings', 'scotland', 'line', 'rest', 'uk', 'measure', 'go', 'step', 'england', 'wale', 'scotland', 'alleged', 'victim', 'sexual', 'history', 'brought', 'defence', 'lawyer', 'defendant', 'previous', 'history', 'sexual', 'offence', 'disclosed', 'jury', 'sexual', 'offence', 'procedure', 'evidence', 'scotland', 'act', 'anyone', 'charged', 'sex', 'offence', 'required', 'appoint', 'solicitor', 'one', 'appointed', 'court', 'defence', 'lawyer', 'also', 'tell', 'court', 'least', 'day', 'trial', 'intend', 'bring', 'victim', 'sexual', 'history', 'crown', 'ha', 'automatic', 'right', 'disclose', 'previous', 'conviction', 'sexual', 'offence', 'jury', 'although', 'defence', 'able', 'appeal', 'right', 'waived', 'new', 'law', 'likely', 'lead', 'many', 'case', 'defendant', 'criminal', 'record', 'issue', 'present', 'legislation', 'come', 'wake', 'string', 'court', 'case', 'scotland', 'woman', 'subjected', 'sustained', 'personal', 'questioning', 'alleged', 'attacker', 'scottish', 'justice', 'minister', 'jim', 'wallace', 'said', 'aim', 'legislation', 'reduce', 'fear', 'deters', 'victim', 'coming', 'forward', 'added', 'executive', 'doe', 'believe', 'victim', 'subjected', 'intense', 'often', 'degrading', 'questioning', 'person', 'accused', 'abusing', 'sandy', 'brindley', 'spokeswoman', 'glasgow', 'rape', 'crisis', 'welcomed', 'act', 'said', 'needed', 'done', 'increase', 'conviction', 'rate', 'going', 'fully', 'address', 'concern', 'justice', 'system', 'said']",160

almost a third of cases of domestic violence began or intensified while a victim was pregnant a study for scotland yard reported yesterday the research into domestic attacks and murders also showed that stalkers were likely to be more violent if they had previously had a relationship with their target and it reported that women trying to end a relationship were among those most at risk of being attacked or killed by their partners senior officers hope the research part of the metropolitan polices understanding and responding to hate crime project will allow them to spot patterns in cases of domestic violence and to intervene more speedily as part of the project which receives funding from the home office researchers studied all domestic murders which are thought to account for about a quarter of all murders and assaults in london over the past two years the study highlighted pregnancy and the time shortly after childbirth as one of the times when a woman is most likely to be attacked with around of violence cases starting during pregnancy according to the report most female victims of stalkers know the man who is stalking them it said potential victims ought to be warned of how dangerous stalkers could be the study found that victims who were trying to terminate relationships were frequent murder victims the report said notions of if i cant have her then no one can were recurring features of such cases threats which begin with if you were to ever leave me must be taken seriously it added that many domestic attacks also arose out of disputes about contact with children and child custody the survey claimed that in general violence tended to get worse in subsequent attacks it said of households had a second incident within five weeks of the first commander

the chancellors flagship childcare policy amounts to a drop in the ocean that is failing to help enough of britains poor families the trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt conceded yesterday ms hewitt who is also minister for women said her department and the treasury were to investigate why the childcare tax credit which helps relatively lowincome working parents pay nursery or childminding costs has not fulfilled government hopes the tax break introduced in and billed by gordon brown the chancellor as a way to make childcare affordable for the many not the few was not having the transforming impact that we thought it would have and that it should have she said the government would examine why the credit was not reaching more families and would look at enlarging its scope she said her admission comes as figures obtained by the labour mp karen buck reveal that the total number of families in england receiving the tax credit in may this year was just only of all families with children up to the age of childcare campaigners are also warning that the credit which is paid out at an average of a week comes nowhere near covering the real costs of childcare in britain which far outstrip costs in other european countries according to the daycare trust the average cost of a fulltime nursery place for a child under two in britain is a week rising to with many nurseries charging significantly more in london megan pacey the trusts senior policy officer said that british parents faced a double burden of astronomical childcare costs and a chronic shortage of provision those two things combined are fatal she said people cant find childcare and when they do they cant afford it we need a situation where we have universally accessible childcare available for those that want and need it under a shakeup of inwork benefits due next april the government is set to replace the childcare tax credit and the working families tax credit of which it forms a part with a new child tax credit according to the treasury the earnings ceiling below which parents are eligible for childcare help will rise from a year to for families with one child and from to for those with two or more children but the maximum benefit payable will remain at a week for one child and for two or more ms pacey said this will expand the numbers qualifying a little bit but the way it will interact with the new child tax credit may cancel out the extra the treasury insisted the credit had been an incredible success a spokesman said the programme had done extremely well because takeup was three times the level of that under family credit the precursor to the working families tax credit introduced by the conservatives ms buck however raised concerns at the low numbers getting the tax break the regents park and kensington north mp is also opposing moves by kensington and chelsea the toryrun london borough to make drastic cuts in provision for underfives which she said would affect lowincome families these cuts include closing part of a community nursery offering the combination of childcare education and afterschool care that the government wants to expand in a letter to ms

what value parenting malcolm dean reports december from the family research conference at the royal statistical society that the need for a twintrack approach to support for working parents of young children is now being acknowledged if family relationships are not to suffer as a result of current work incentive programmes but even a new dealplus type programme offering parent support as well as work opportunities would not address the short and longterm implications for children and their parents of a radical alternative offering parents the option of devoting more time to parenting young children through an adequate financial acknowledgement of the value of this role while recent changes to all forms of parental leave are welcome they do not go far enough and have not received sufficient public debate antipoverty strategies including the national childcare strategy and the whole of the governments welfaretowork agenda that drives it are promoted in the absence of a thorough analysis from a public health perspective of the real costs and benefits attached to longer and paid maternity leave in particular arguably this might benefit the countrys economy more in the long run as experience elsewhere in europe already suggests eva lloyd london any step towards lifting families and others out of poverty is welcome but tax credits for lowpaid workers with families is a very limited and inadequate target our daughter works in the nhs as a health care assistant and government intervention to boost her scandalously low wages goes some way to alleviate the cost of living and providing for two children but she is unable to afford the cost of a travel pass to use the rail service relying on a cheaper but longer and far more stressful bus journey through londons traffic we

voluntary organisations says only of charities total expenditure is spent on fundraising and publicity technically this may be true but would most charity supporters not be more interested to know what proportion of their donations was spent on fundraising as opposed to the proportion of total income which includes for example government contracts and income from fees and charges according to a study at south bank university of more than charities covering more than half the total fundraisedincome of all charities the propor tion averaged not and the most common or median figure was the average is higher because it is skewed by a group of giant charities with very high costs charities with high levels of legacy income tend to have lower costs and vice versa these are the figures that

date rape and rape by a husband or partner must be treated as seriously by the courts as rape by a stranger the lord chief justice said yesterday issuing the first rape guidelines for years lord woolf adopted recommendations by the independent sentencing advisory panel which concluded from a public opinion survey that the impact of rape on the victim was equally serious whatever his or her relationship with the offender lord woolf took the opportunity of three rape appeals to issue the first guidance for judges in the crown courts on sentencing in date rape marital rape and male rape cases when the former lord chief justice lord lane issued the last guidance in he was silent on whether rapes within relationships should be treated less seriously than those by strangers marital rape and rape of males were not mentioned because they were not then considered rape by the law the advisory panel had urged the court of appeal to make a clear statement that when it came to passing sentence cases of relationship rape and acquaintance rape were to be treated as seriously as stranger rape lord woolf sitting with lord justice rose and mrs justice hallett also agreed that rape of a male by another male was equally serious and there was no inherent distinction between anal and vaginal rape he stressed that the appropriate sentence would depend on the mitigating and aggravating factors in each individual case and warned judges against applying the guidelines in a mechanistic or indiscriminate way which could result in inappropriately high or low sentences lord woolf confirmed that the starting points laid down by lord lane for judges when considering how long a sentence to pass will now apply to all rapes regardless of the relationship between victim and offender these are five years in custody for a single rape on an adult victim eight years for rapes with an aggravating feature such as gang rapes homophobic rapes or rape of a child years for a serial rapist and life for a perverted or psychopathic rapist who is likely to remain a danger to the public in practice many relationship rapes will continue to attract lower sentences than stranger rapes because of mitigating factors in the former or aggravating factors in the latter lord woolf said that when a couple sharing the same bed had been out drinking and the man failed to show the restraint he should have it would be contrary to common sense to treat what happened as equivalent to stranger rape giving an example of a case of marital rape for which lord taylor a former lord chief justice had reduced the sentence from three years to months lord woolf said the courts today would now consider three years the right sentence but in two of the three cases before the court yesterday the victims had been raped by expartners in a particularly brutal way and the court upheld the sentences of nine and years in the third case the court reduced from five years to four the sentence passed on a yearold guilty of raping a yearold male friend lord woolf urged the home secretary david blunkett to give greater priority to the shortage of treatment programmes for young sex offenders the lord chief justice said members of the public interviewed in the panels survey had found it unacceptable that a plea of guilty should result in a shorter sentence but that was because they saw it as primarily about saving court time and costs and allowing the defendant to manipulate the system in his favour the real reason for a reduced sentence was that a guilty plea spared the victim the trauma of giving evidence,2002-12,date rape rape husband partner must treated seriously court rape stranger lord chief justice said yesterday issuing first rape guideline year lord woolf adopted

they cant sack me im pregnant many people believe that being pregnant automatically safeguards their job but while your employer cant give you the heaveho just because you are expecting they can still sack you for all the usual reasons you can also be made redundant while you are on maternity leave if your employer can prove your post is no longer valid companies arent allowed to question candidates about their private lives in a job interview while employment specialists advise employers to tread carefully when asking interviewees about their private lives there is nothing in law which says they cannot do so if for example the job requires you to work unsociable hours or to relocate it would be reasonable for the interviewer to ask you whether you have a family or outside commitments however such questions would have to be asked equally of all candidates both male and female to avoid suggestions of discrimination i dont have to work public holidays it depends what your contract says there is nothing in law which says employees have the right to take the day off on public holidays likewise you are only entitled to extra pay for working public holidays or weekends if it says so in your contract you have to have two verbal warnings and a written warning before you are dismissed not always although this is the path usually taken by employers when they want to get rid of a member of staff they can sometimes go straight to the written warning stage depending on the severity of the offence commit gross misconduct however urinate in the wastepaper basket give the boss a black eye or get caught with your hand in the petty cash box and you can be dismissed on the spot im entitled to a onehour lunchbreak the onehour lunchbreak which most of us expect has more to do with convention than legal requirements the law says that for every block of six hours you work you must have a minute break although this has to be taken somewhere in the middle of your shift rather than at the beginning or end it doesnt necessarily have to be at lunchtime you have to have worked for an organisation for more than one year before you have any rights although it is generally true that you can only take your employer to a tribunal for unfair dismissal if you have worked for them for over a year there are exceptions if for example you had worked somewhere for just under one year before you were asked to leave you could argue that your employment was deliberately cut short you could also argue that owed holiday or a notice period would have taken you past the oneyear guideline however you have rights against discrimination on the grounds of race disability gender sexual orientation religion and trade union membership from day one of your employment the same is true for breach of contract i have to give a months notice because im paid monthly only if it says so in your contract the legal requirement is one week in return your employer has to give you a weeks notice for every complete year of service with a maximum of weeks unless your contract says otherwise if my employer gets rid of me i will get compensation not necessarily you will be entitled to some compensation if you are made redundant that is to say your post within the organisation is no longer needed or the company closes down the amount you get will depend on your age and the length of time you have been in your job if you are sacked for anything other than gross misconduct you are only entitled to the notice period in your contract or payment in lieu of this despite the sixfigure sums that hit the headlines most people are surprised to learn that compensation for unfair dismissal is usually quite low ive got a right to be treated reasonably by my employer sadly although there are laws to protect you against intimidation discrimination and constructive dismissal in the workplace there is nothing which says your employer has to be nice to you so if you work in a stressful environment where people work to tight deadlines and lose their tempers its tough luck advice courtesy of diane sinclair adviser to the chartered institute of personnel and development and richard

chancellor gordon brown polished up his childfriendly credentials last week promising to help increase the number of workplace nurseries and crches and announcing financial help for some parents who use approved childcare within their own homes there are only about workplace nurseries and crches in the uk the chancellor aims to encourage more employers to offer childcare facilities through tax and national insurance incentives the details of which will be set out in the forthcoming document balancing work and family life enhancing choice and support for parents donna and nick johnson whose first baby noah was born seven weeks ago hope the tax breaks will enable their employers to extend existing childcare provision for staff the couple are both registrar paediatricians donna works at kings college hospital and nick at st georges hospital in london they have both applied for places on their respective employers nursery schemes which cost about a week but as nick points out there is no guarantee of a place about people work at the st georges trust many of whom are women with young children and there are just places he says even if noah gets a place the hours could still prove difficult the st georges nursery scheme operates between am and pm with extensions to pm on mondays and thursdays only nick says he and donna will try to negotiate their work timetables so that they are not on call at the same time but adds sometimes things can fall apart and it wont be that easy megan pacey of the daycare trust says the nhs has its own childcare strategy which may not be
