threequarters of local authorities in england plan to put up council tax for the poorest households often by hundreds of pounds new research reveals from april local authorities in england will take control of a previously national scheme of subsidies for the hardest up families usually with no working adults or those working on the minimum wage at the same time as funding for the scheme is cut by the resolution foundation thinktank surveyed councils and found that while some planned to make savings from other budgets said they would have to make households that did not previously pay any council tax start paying some of the bill andor reduce discounts to lowincome working households in the worst cases bills will rise by a year says the resolution foundation millions of englands poorest households are already very close to the edge given falling wages tax credits and benefits said gavin kelly the foundations chief executive warning most of those would find it hard to cope when the bills arrived the new system will result in hardpressed councils spending scarce resources chasing some of the poorest people in the country for nonpayment meanwhile iain duncan smith is to announce on thursday that drug and alcohol addiction family breakdown going to a failing school and living in a home with no working adult could all be included in a future measure of child poverty

addicted to drugs or alcohol backing up the former conservative leaders longheld argument that the current financialbased measure alone is not enough to further strengthen his argument he will also announce that children were officially lifted out of child poverty last year but this was largely due to a fall in median income the benchmark for measuring the problem the old incomebased target

it is extraordinary that the government is only now turning its attention to childcare given its record of rising child poverty million children including about half of children from black or pakistani households police in islington distributing food vouchers to kids shoplifting bread we cant assume that mothers and childrens wellbeing will be the aim rather childcare is a means of getting mothers especially those on benefit out to work so im shocked but not surprised by elizabeth trusss proposal for more industrialised childcare raising low wages by raising productivity one adult to cater for the needs of six toddlers not too many seem convinced that any adult can do that without constant crisis or worse just as unbelievable is that an education in english and maths is a training for caring in fact loving care which any sensible mother might have told them is the central need of children was not even mentioned by the minister we know from the experience of raising the educational qualifications for nurses that caring has not been enhanced by a university degree quite the opposite ive heard nurses complain that their supervisors demand they spend less time chatting with patients and get on with the bandaging or the injection or the pilldispensing theres also an assumption that a basic function of childcare is lifting the child to the first rung of the education ladder but what children learn in childcare is how to be with others catering to their needs enables them to more easily relate if the staff levels are too low children will have to compete with others for affection and attention that is not what we want our children to learn the government plans are in response not only to the crisis of unaffordable childcare that many sectors of women have complained about but also a rise in the need for childcare more women are going out to work or at least looking for work in a dread job climate because of desperate financial need for example in income support for single mothers began to be phased out since then thousands of women have been thrown on to the job market when this particular cut based on tony blairs characterisation of mothers caring at home as workless was imposed by new labour there was no accompanying policy for caring for the children of mothers forced out to work beneath this major and many think destructive change in social values is the assumption that women are better off if they leave their children for waged work what work for what wages and at what cost shouldnt we ask the obvious class facts remain largely unstated as alison wolf writes a majority of woman do jobs concentrated in heavily feminised occupations such as retailing cleaning and clerical work their average earnings per hour and over a lifetime are well below those of males many women have a different view to the government of when their children are too young to be with strangers fulltime of mothers with young children who have fulltime jobs would rather work parttime or be fulltime carers according to a mumsnet survey a case in point is childminders often mothers who want to raise their own children and finance this by sharing the work of raising other peoples children we have to remember that women forced to take whatever job is available will be forced also to take whatever childcare is available which they can afford most of us are just not in a position to defend our children from being among the too many that the childcare worker has to deal with polly toynbees description of toddlers strapped into high chairs in front of the tv is already a reality for many mothers know it and are helpless and often riddled with guilt in the face of it when a decade ago a guardian journalist desperate that she had little time for her children and worried that her own interests contradicted theirs asked is more childcare really what we and our children need she was asking a key question and since the government appears to favour european examples lets give some in finland and norway parents are entitled to a universal cashforcare benefit if they care for young children at home rather than use publicly funded daycare in norway of parents with underthrees welcomed this as freedom of choice even when they didnt apply themselves in finland more than of mothers with children under three apply for the benefit

the sight of a double pram with four babies topandtailing and three toddlers trailing behind on reins is not uncommon in denmark neither is a wooden trailer with six children being towed about by bike or babies swaddled in blankets and left outside cafes and shops in subzero temperatures to sleep in some ways denmark the land of lego hans christian andersen and brilliant fictional females could be held up as a role model by those supporting the current childcare proposals in the uk earlyyears minister elizabeth truss wants to increase the stafftochild ratio for childminders and nurseries so that each carer will be able to look after four toddlers rather than three staff with higher qualifications will be able to take charge of more children still this is said to be a move towards the danish model where no national standard is set but where childminders regularly care for four or more children according to the digital education resource archive and the department for education a higher ratio makes childcare more affordable and so truss argues will help to get british mothers back to work propping up the economy just like in denmark only the childcare situation in the uk is nothing like that in denmark in denmark the state pays of the costs of childcare if your monthly household income converted to annual household income is below danish kroner approximately youll get a further deduction and if you earn below danish kroner a year its completely free according to the latest figures from the central denmark region theres also a discount for siblings so that if you have more than one child using childcare you pay full price for the most expensive daycare and halfprice for the others of course the state cant pay for all this without a significant contributions in the form of taxes from its five million inhabitants income up to danish kroner is taxed at at present and anything over this is taxed at progressive rates up to but as well as subsidised childcare tax pays for the family allowance given directly to any mother with children below years regardless of income child benefits awarded to single parents children of widowswidowers multichildren families and to parents who are studying free schools and universities where students still receive grants remember them the result denmark is ranked fourth for female employment among the countries in the

all staff are qualified and the range of experiences and activities broadens out to prepare them for school from the very start parents can choose whether to send their children to daycare for a full day three quarters of the day or a half day pickup times can be flexible from around pm to pm and most office working hours are am until pm whereas the average cost of childcare in the uk starts at a month for a parttime place hours danes pay around danish kroner a month for hours including lunch truss may have incensed many with her comments on childcare provision in the uk but she appears to be

thousands of children and their families who have sought refuge in the uk have been pushed into severe poverty by the low levels of asylum support a parliamentary inquiry has revealed concluding that the support system for asylum seekers is in urgent need of reform the inquiry found evidence of children being left destitute and homeless without state support and forced to rely on food parcels among numerous case studies the report cites the example of a mother who slept on the floor of a mosque with her sixyearold and threeyearold for five months last year surviving on handouts from people attending the mosque until her application for asylum support was accepted parents told us they went without food to buy basic items for their family and for their children we were presented with evidence of the increased maternal and infant death rates amongst pregnant women in the asylum system caused by poverty problems accessing care and social isolation said the former childrens minister sarah teather who led the inquiry into asylum support for children and young people woeful levels of support for asylum seekers are pushing children into severe poverty and are far below what they need to have a decent life the evidence we have heard is shocking and appalling it is an affront to this countrys proud tradition of giving sanctuary to those fleeing danger and violence those on the lowest rate of support receive their allowance on a prepaid card and do not receive any cash payments which means they are unable to use the bus to get to school or to the doctors or buy milk from a corner shop because the card can only be used in designated shops the crossparty inquiry condemned the system as indefensible the panel also concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that making things more difficult for families will make them more likely to leave the uk or discourage anyone from coming here although no official data is available the childrens society estimates there are about children surviving on basic asylum support most of their parents are awaiting a decision on their refugee status about children whose parents have been refused asylum but are unable to return to their home country are living on the even more basic noncash support system known as section it would be hard to argue that is humane teather said leaving children and their families with no money to catch a bus make a phone call or buy basic goods seems senseless the strain described by families who endure this system of support but who are unable to return home is not something this crossparty panel think is defensible the inquiry concluded that section should be abolished and replaced with a cashbased system and recommended that even those families who have been refused asylum should be given a higher rate of support until they are able to leave the country the inquiry was very critical of the frequency with which families are forced to move around the country at the whim of the asylumsupport system it cited the case of a mother and her fouryearold daughter who were forced to move times during their asylum claim what most concerned the panel was the host of problems encountered by children and families in the asylumsupport system who are moved with no regard to their education relationships health or home life the report concluded a uk border agency spokesperson said the reports findings would be considered carefully no one need face destitution if they comply with the law and the decisions of the courts and go home when required to do so if failed asylum seekers cannot return home through no fault of their own we will provide support to ensure they are not destitute including housing and an allowance for living expenses,2013-01,thousand child family

the mantra of our era is the promise to do more with less from mandarins to middle managers everyone who controls a budget these days faces having to make this pitch to sceptical staff on tuesday it was the turn of childrens minister elizabeth truss to explain how by rewriting some rules and ripping up others she could chivvy englands creaking childcare sector to provide more places her plans were titled more great childcare but as sure start centres shut and childcare credits are restricted the mood of many working parents is not so great a working mother ms truss is at least seized by the significance of the issue heaven knows that a conservative party that is points behind labour among female voters needs to wake up to it too she made effective play with damning statistics about an average hourly wage of just an insult compared with teaching wages even though the academic consensus now suggests that education during the earliest years can be of more significance than anything that happens at school an equation littered with the terms excessive costs inadequate pay and no more public money is bound to be tricky to solve ms trusss response is to draw abler workers into the sector before increasing their workload by allowing them to take more children the kindest thing that can be said is that in theory at least it is not obviously daft it is a deregulatory scheme straight out of the economics textbook existing rules are certainly tight requiring for example one minder for every baby and there is of course a sense in which carers taking in extra infants will be more productive not to mention better paid the obvious anxiety is that where just one adult is responsible for the proposed four toddlers or six in a nursery the children wont get much in the way of real care still less the elementary education which ms truss in an echo of prime ministerial parlance says will help britain win the global race the hope is that these lofty ambitions can be rescued in more crowded nurseries through the professionalisation of earlyyears careers with better training perhaps more carers would prove able not merely to look after more children than now but to look after them well that according to ms truss is what already happens in many continental countries perhaps although all the figures she quotes are all maximum regulated ratios the betterfunded childcare in say france typically operates well below these limits norway and new zealand are both looking at moving in the opposite direction and in scandinavia more generous parental leave means that nurseries less often deal with those youngest infants and the overwhelming practicalities that go with them take even three toddlers and throw in a tummy bug and a nanny might have to change nappies in a day education is plainly not going to get much of a lookin in these circumstances since it is likely to be as much as she can physically do to stop the tots not being changed at any one moment from injuring themselves perhaps the right training might make it easier to get through such days but it is hard to see the utility of the proposed requirement for gcse maths basic trigonometry is not going to help the biggest danger of the lot is that quality will suffer as childcare class sizes rocket in places where parents have no choice but to go with the cheapest nursery while parents in more prosperous parts of town continue to finance twotoone or threetoone care a new class divide at the earliest ages is the last thing that england needs and yet as ms truss conceded yesterday there are already signs of precisely that the way around it is to target such subsidy as is available at those who need it most but there are alarming signs that the coalition is about to move in the opposite direction by downgrading meanstested help in order to fund childcare vouchers that can be showered far and wide after all the talk about social mobility a nurserylevel course in the facts remains

reforms designed to make childcare less expensive are being delayed by arguments that spilled out in public on tuesday over how much the government can afford to extend help to middleclass families changes that would allow childminders and nurseries to increase the number of babies and young children in their care if they improve qualifications and toughen up inspections were confirmed by the early years minister elizabeth truss however there was confusion over a linked announcement about funding to help families pay for childcare which has now been delayed and which previous reports suggested would replace the current mixture of incentives with a universal taxbreak for parents with children aged under five early on tuesday truss told the bbc radio today programme that the delayed announcement was the big thing and is coming and had support across the coalition government were agreed the liberal democrats are agreed said truss all families who go into work we want to help with their childcare costs were absolutely clear about that however hours later another tory mp claire perry who is close to the chancellor george osborne and advises the prime minister on childhood issues said that although there is something coming there were still furious negotiations i think she truss perhaps got a little bit ahead of herself with the announcement there is something coming perry told radio s the world at one there are basically furious negotiations going on saying wed like to commit more money to doing this but how much is available and whats the best way to spend it lib dem and treasury sources played down reports that the coalition was split over how far to extend financial support for childcare or that the treasury was blocking reforms in a row over how they would be afforded an announcement is expected in spring the sources stressed that there were continuing policy debates for example over whether it was best to use tax breaks or subsidies to help families with children but that most of the discussion was about nuts and bolts details of how the changes would be made lib dems pointed to party leader nick cleggs comments in the latest issue of the house magazine in which he appeared to row back from a previous claim that support must be targeted saying instead im unambiguously in favour and have been an archproponent of giving more help to the british middle classes options suggested by the emerging compromise include extending financial support to all but the highest rate tax payers and other coalition policies such as hours free childcare for twoyearolds from the poorest families will be highlighted under the plans published by truss for consultation nurseries may increase the number of children cared for by each worker from three to four babies under one or from four to six twoyearolds and childminders will in future be able to look after up to four children under five including two babies under one childcarers will have to have at least grade c level gcses in english and maths and a new graduate early years learning qualification will be introduced ofsted will also increase inspections for preschool nurseries and childminders and childminders will be able to join agencies that would pool administration such as registration and chasing payments and allow them to share care when one or more minder was unable to work for example due to illness the attempt to increase the quality of childcare was widely welcomed but there is opposition from childcare organisations unions and parenting forums to the proposed change to the adulttochild ratios a mumsnet poll found only of members supported the changes and netmums reported support neil leitch the chief executive of the preschool learning alliance said we are absolutely appalled by this fixation to alter ratios despite the fact that those working in the sector are universally opposed to the proposal truss stressed that changes to ratios would be voluntary and linked to better qualifications and were in line with other european countries where childcare was considered better quality and cheaper for these reasons they should not be used by nurseries to simply cut costs because better qualified staff could command higher wages and should not create a twotier system where middleclass parents paid more for carers minding fewer children one of the things im trying to do is change parental perceptions parents should be taking note of the qualifications as well as the ratios truss told the guardian of course ratios are important but there are other focuses the national child minders association said it was also worried about childminding agencies which could dilute inspection of individual carers in their homes parents rely on ofsted

nothing less than the very best will do for our children seeing frances coles maternelles or visiting the superb nursery run by durand academy in south london is an education in just how wonderful childcare can be the best lets children grow socially and physically gets them ready for school and lets women because it is usually women who face this choice rejoin the workforce everyone agrees what the problems are with the system as it stands variable provision throughout the country nurseries struggling with costs and inadequate qualifications for workers these issues are precisely those we are determined to take action on yet many people in this debate seem reluctant to give providers the flexibility they need to actually do something about the huge flaws in the system polly toynbee today challenged me to prove i could work in childcare myself im afraid that betrays an inability to appreciate that childcare workers are professionals it is high time we stopped thinking childcare is something that anyone could do those european countries whose childcare is widely admired put greater trust in highly qualified staff in england nursery staff are not allowed to look after more than four twoyearolds but in france they can look after eight toynbee has sung the praises of the national level of sweden and denmark yet those countries impose no ratios of nursery staff to children at all we propose to allow nursery workers to look after six twoyearolds and four instead of three ones or under and only when staff have higher quality qualifications so we can drive up quality we are not proposing to change the ratios for three and fouryearolds but we do want to see more teacherled classes for children about to go to school our plans are in line with what i have seen working in other countries they are motivated entirely by the drive to do what is best for children childminders would also be given greater freedom and for the same reason simply put quality matters more than quantity we will not force professionals to take more children than they want to but it is selfdefeating for this country to put a ceiling on pay by having the toughest restrictions in europe where providers face a choice between hiring more staff or hiring betterpaid staff with greater ability i want them to be allowed to pick the vastly preferable second option we believe nursery staff should earn more than an average of an hour annual earnings of are below frances average of they are significantly below denmarks and swedens we pay our primary school teachers comparatively well

terina manchandsimpson manager of lithos preschool in swiss cottage north london believes that freeflow play which involves moving between indoor playrooms and an outdoor playground at will is one of the most important facilities that her centre offers and one that the children she cares for enjoy its not just about their physical development she said being able to go outside whenever the children want sparks unexpected learning curves when it was snowing they broke ice off the play equipment and we talked about it melting then put snow into a tray with toy polar bears in the autumn they picked up leaves and we did all sorts of projects but manchandsimpson fears that freeflow play may have to stop thanks to the increased childtostaff ratios statutory ratios vary for age and settings but the changes due to come into force in the autumn will increase the number of twoyearolds per adult from four to six for those aged one and under the ratio will increase from three children per adult to four nurseries will have a staff to child ration that allows more babies while childminders on their own can have again with more babies when i first heard about the new ratios for twoyearolds my immediate thought was how will this impact on the children i thought straightaway of our freeflow play we have children here and a child staff ratio of i just dont see how those same adults could safely care for twice as many children she said staring out into the playground and trying to picture it no i cant see how that would be safe there are other implications from the new ratios monday was the start of micah daycreators third week at the preschool and the first day he didnt arrive tearful needing onetoone attention from manchandsimpson micah is a standard normal threeyearold he just took a long time to settle said manchandsimpson i could give him the attention he needed but theres no way i could have done that had i had more children to look after natalie micahs mother also

parents and childcare bodies have come out strongly against government proposals to let carers look after more children elizabeth truss the early years minister said the measure would bring limits in the uk in line with other european countries with good quality childcare and would allow carers to earn more money and so encourage more into the profession however the announcement that a single nursery worker could look after up to four babies under one or up to six twoyearolds and childminders could care for four underfives including two babies faced criticism from across the spectrum neil leitch the chief executive of the preschool learning alliance which describes itself as the largest representative organisation of childcare and early years providers in england said we are absolutely appalled by this fixation to alter ratios despite the fact that those working in the sector are universally opposed to the proposal the national childminding association which represents homebased childminders and nannies said there was some good news where the proposals had been adapted to take into account previous concerns about raising the limit for childminders from a total of six to eight young children but it still had significant concerns particularly about increasing the number of underfives without extra support and allowing childminding agencies which could dilute inspection of individual carers in their homes parents rely on ofsted inspection of individual childminders to reassure them their child will be safe and receive a quality experience in that individuals care said liz bayram the associations joint chief executive ultimately the business model for an agency is based on recruiting lots of childminders willing to pay them a fee and potentially a commission for placing parents with them purnima tanuku the chief executive of the national day nurseries association said many parents were worried the changes would have a negative impact on their children adding we are particularly concerned about suggestions to increase the number of children under three that nursery staff can look after due to the degree of personal attention needed by very young children strong adultchild interactions are vital for good child development staff with higher qualifications will still find it difficult to give larger groups of underthrees the level of practical care they need tanukus claim is backed by surveys by two of the countrys most popular parent networking sites a survey for mumsnet found only of parents wanted higher childtominder ratios even if that reduced costs and another for netmums found supported the idea one quarter were not sure and were opposed on tuesday morning their websites were dominated by negative reaction with members fearing the new system could be abused by nurseries to lower staff costs rather than fees and that there would be lower standards of care and more accidents i can see it widening the gap between rich and poor with people paying more just to get a decent ratio and others just having to accept the changes and reduction in care suggested one mumsnet member stephen twigg the shadow education secretary said the government isnt listening to parents and isnt listening to what the experts are saying about this under this proposal we could have childminders looking after four oneyearold babies at that age it is vitally important that children are getting proper care and attention i dont think its right to change this truss used her speech at the policy exchange thinktank in london to address a challenge by the guardian columnist polly toynbee about how the minister herself would cope with looking after so many children i dont start from the premise that anyone can be an early educator said truss its a very demanding job that requires great and specialist expertise im not trained to do the job im a politician not an early educator and im equally sure that i would not be able to walk into a class of yearolds and teach them german other critics said the government had failed to address criticisms of the system chis keates the general secretary of the nasuwt teaching union said the simple fact is that in many of the countries cited by the government such as france the costs of childcare are broadly comparable with those in england the critical difference is that the level of state support for childcare is much higher thereby reducing the price that parents are required to pay frances ogrady the tuc general secretary urged ministers to reconsider cuts that have made childcare even harder for parents to afford by cutting tax credits freezing child benefit and withdrawing it for higher earners the government has made childcare even more unaffordable the closure of hundreds of sure start centres despite promising to protect them has also made it harder to access affordable places but deregulating childcare is not the solution truss sought to allay parents fears of their children being neglected by overpressed staff pointing out that the relaxation she proposes still leaves more restrictive ratios than denmark france and germany three countries often cited as providing highquality care for preschool children one of the problems that parents have is not just the exorbitant cost it is the availability of childcare i personally have struggled to find a nursery place for love or money and many parents say that truss said on radio s today programme on tuesday morning by raising care ratios truss said popular operations would be able to expand by economies of scale which would make childcare more widely available reforms she said would also mean better paid and better qualified staff the pay level of staff at the moment nursery workers are getting an hour its barely more than the minimum wage i do not think that is an acceptable wage rate for what should be a professional job what i want to see in nursery care is something that is much more a continuum of the education system the department for education dfe said the proposals were dependent on staff possessing higher qualifications including cgrade gcse maths and english the dfe said englands relatively tight ratios have two main effects higher costs for parents and lower pay for staff in turn low pay drags down the quality of the workforce in other countries providers can use the extra income they get from taking on more children to reduce fees for parents and pay staff more but this is not possible in england,2013-01,parent childcare body come strongly government proposal let carers look child

a relaxation in the number of preschool children that nurseries and registered childminders can oversee has been announced as part of a move to professionalise the preschool workforce and cut the cost of childcare in england elizabeth truss the early years minister has proposed that childminders currently restricted to looking after three children per staff member from the ages of one to five inclusive should in future be permitted to look after four children they would also be allowed to look after two children under one year of age instead of the current one truss will seek to allay parents fears of their children being neglected by overpressed staff pointing out that the relaxation she proposes still leaves more restrictive ratios than denmark france and germany three countries often cited as providing highquality care for preschool children the minister will quote experts claiming that in britain more qualifications are needed to look after animals than toddlers she is also proposing that nurseries be allowed to relax their ratios when qualified staff are present increasing from four to six twoyearold children per staff member in the case of oneyearolds the permitted stafftochild ratios would rise from the current onetothree to onetofour the ratios would rise further if a fullyqualified teacher is present she will also relax how these rules are interpreted one of the problems that parents have is not just the exorbitant cost it is the availability of childcare i personally have struggled to find a nursery place for love or money and many parents say that truss said on radio s today programme on tuesday morning by raising care ratios truss said popular operations would be able to expand by economies of scale which would make childcare more widely available reforms she said would also mean better paid and better qualified staff the pay level of staff at the moment nursery workers are getting an hour its barely more than the minimum wage i do not think that is an acceptable wage rate for what should be a professional job what i want to see in nursery care is something that is much more a continuum of the education system the department for education dfe said the proposals were dependent on staff possessing higher qualifications including cgrade gcse maths and english the dfe said englands relatively tight ratios have two main effects higher costs for parents and lower pay for staff in turn low pay drags down the quality of the workforce in other countries providers can use the extra income they get from taking on more children to reduce fees for parents and pay staff more but this is not possible in england the proposed flexibility has been labelled unacceptable and a recipe for disaster by the preschool learning alliance the largest representative organisation of early years providers labour has also attacked the proposals the shadow education secretary stephen twigg said experts are warning this could threaten child safety and wont reduce costs parents will be worried truss is also to propose that onestop shop child agencies be given more freedom to help homebased childminders truss will tell the policy exchange thinktank we have seen a decrease in the number of childminders over recent years this is in part because childminders have to be business owners some people want a simpler way to enter the profession and parents want to be assured of quality so we are setting up onestop shops called childminder agencies to do the practicalities and to give parents some reassurance over quality she added she would introduce graduatelevel early years teachers trained specifically to teach young children only of nursery staff and of homebased childminders are qualified to alevel standard or equivalent her

andrew lansley the leader of the commons has admitted that a conservative defeat in the commons this afternoon could make it harder for his party to win the next election he was speaking after mps voted by a majority of to back a lords amendment delaying boundary changes that would have helped the tories until the lib dems voted with labour as did most of the minor parties four tory mps john baron basildon amp billericay philip davies shipley david davis haltemprice amp howden and sir richard shepherd aldridgebrownhills also voted with labour downing street has announced that david cameron is to fly to algeria on wednesday for talks with the algerian political leadership in the wake of the jihadist assault of the in amenas gas plant that led to the killing of foreigners including five britons stephen twigg the shadow education secretary has said that the governments childcare policy has descended into shambles after a number advise appeared to contradict a minister on the today programme this morning elizabeth truss the education minister said a forthcoming announcement about help with childcare costs would benefit all families but on the world at one claire perry david camerons adviser on childhood said i think truss perhaps got a little bit ahead of herself with the announcement perry suggested that the subsidy would be targetted at poorer families the treasury has disclosed that nearly children who live abroad are receiving benefits claimed by immigrant families living in britain as the press association reports just under families are claiming child benefits and tax credit for offspring who live outside the uk but within the european union as well as iceland liechtenstein and norway poland is home to the highest number of children in the region who are receiving benefits claimed in the uk with more than half the total receiving welfare the figures were disclosed by treasury minister sajid javid in a written answer to keith vaz chairman of the home affairs select committee vaz said i am very surprised at this figure most people would consider it wrong for people to receive child benefit when the children are living abroad permanently justine greening the international development secretary has launched a trade and global value chains tgvc initiative which will work with some of the uks biggest high street names to improve working conditions and job opportunities in some of the worlds poorest countries greening has defended the governments decision to give aid to pakistan giving evidence to the international development committee she said that giving aid to the country was a sensible move and that the government was not trying to buy influence but sir malcolm bruce the committee chairman questioned the commitment what influence do we have over the pakistan government they are taking aid programmes they are taking our taxes not paying their own taxes there is billions of pounds they have got in bank accounts yet they are taking money from the imf everybody collectively says we expect them to do something they have had plans in the past to raise their tax base its gone down not up to put it at it most negative are they saying well well take your money and do what we please former ministers have told mps on the public adminstration committee that cabinet minsters should have a say in the appointment of permanent secretaries caroline spelman the former environment secretary said she was told that she would not be involved when a new permanent secretary was chosen for her i felt that since i have the accountability in the department i found it very strange that this person on whom to some extent your political life depends i didnt feel i would have enough say ivan lewis the shadow international development secretary has said that a labour government would commit britain to ending absolute poverty in the developing world by thats all for today thanks for the comments in the end it wasnt even close so much for all those rumours about a new northern ireland airport david cameron does not seem to have persuaded any of the minor parties to back him and in parliamentary terms a majority of is really rather large one consequences of todays vote is that all those tories the boneheads one might call them who think that they can somehow dispense with the lib dems and govern alone should now realise the full extent of their folly the real story is about the impact on the next election if david cameron does lose the election in we may well look back and remember this afternoon as the moment when defeat became inevitable the new boundaries would certainly have made the conservative task in easier but as the elections expert lewis baston argued here it is easy to exaggerate the impact these proposals would have had as anthony wells explained at uk polling report even on the revised boundaries cameron would still have failed to gain an overall majority on the basis of the results under the current system the tories need to be points ahead of labour to win an overall majority on the wells analysis under the revised boundaries the tories would have still have needed a lead of points there has been a tory revolt but it does seem to have relatively small there are conservatives who normally vote in the commons if you include nadine dorries and at least of them did not support the government at least four voted against the government and as i write it is not clear whether the others abstained as a protest or did not vote for some other reason earlier see pm i said this would be the most colossal coalition split since and that this could have longterm implications for coalition relations in truth the damage such as it is no one is expecting the coalition to collapse any time soon was probably done some time ago but today certainly wont help and it would be a mistake to read too much into the fact that the lib dems were voting with labour if labourlib dem relations are drifting out of the deep hatred zone as andrew rawnsley argued in an interesting column recently nick cleggs response to the leveson report was probably more important in this regard but anything that dislodges the cement holding our coalition bloc politics in place is at least worth noting ill post a full afternoon summary shortly heres some more on the result from the labour whips from labours chris bryant from the guardians nicholas watt from the daily mails tim shipman from the conservative mp alun cairns the conservatives have lost by to a majority of this is from labours chris bryant and this is from labours kevin brennan if the dup are definitely voting with labour its all over for cameron this is from labours toby perkins it looks as if nadine dorries who is still technically an independent is voting with her conservative colleagues presumably one reason why sir george young the chief whip has not restored the whip to her yet is because he wants to ensure that she toes the line on issues like this john bercow the speaker is calling the vote now greg mulholland a lib dem mp is speaking now he says he tabled an amendment when the boundary changes were originally proposed saying they should be delayed if the number of mps is reduced it will be harder for mps to perform the myriad of roles they are expected to perform ben gummer a conservative says the arguments used by the lib dems have been specious in the extreme back in the commons the conservative peter bone is speaking now he says the lib dems got their referendum on av in return they should support the boundary changes the tories kept to that deal the lib dems are a disgrace he says if lib dem ministers vote against the government they should resign cross the floor and sit with the labour opposition paul waugh at politcshome has a good point back in the commons chris ruane is still speaking the government says it wants to cut the size of the commons to save money he says ruane says he tried to table a question in the commons asking how much mps and peers cost his question was not allowed but a peer asked the question in the lords and was told that an mp costs while a peer costs he also says this government has created peers i cant find that written answer but here is one from a few years ago with broadly comparable figures there is a davies theme to the tory rebellion today david davis the former shadow home secretary told the telegraph yesterday that he would probably vote against the boundary changes and philip davies the shipley mp said he would definitely be voting against the government and glyn davies told the paper that he would not be supporting the government but that he had not decided whether to abstain or to vote against he posted this on twitter this morning labours chris ruane is speaking now he says he has been interesting for a long time in the issue of people missing from the electoral register the last labour government did not do enough to address this but no one can accuse it for introducing constitutional reform for party advantage labour introduced pr for european elections and the number of euro seats it had in wales went down from four to one as a result he says back in the commons penny morduant a conservative is speaking now she says spite pettiness and selfinterest are behind the lib dem decision to oppose the boundary changes today she says nick clegg can repeat until hes blue in the face that the coalition agreement included a commitment to lords reform but it didnt she says it just committed the government to bringing forward proposals which it did joe oliver has posted on his blog a marvellously detailed analysis of how todays vote could work out heres the key extract these dismal figures would leave the tory whips facing a result anywhere between a best case scenario conservative mps nadine dorries dup mps vote for the snp plaid cymru william mccrea eric joyce and george galloway dont vote labour lib dems sdlp alliance green sylvia hermon vote against an opposition majority of or a worst case scenario conservative mps vote for labour lib dems dup snp plaid cymru sdlp green alliance sylvia hermon eric joyce george galloway nadine dorries vote against a comfortable opposition majority of back in the commons john thurso says that cutting the size of the commons would increase the size of the payroll vote in proportion to the rest of the house that would strengthen the grip of the executive he says he says he originally had personal reservations about the decision to introduce the boundary changes but he accepted on the basis that the coalition agreement was not a pickandmix menu he accepted because the tories were going to implement lords reform but when the tories blocked lords reform he told his party that he could no longer support the new boundaries he ends by pointing out that there is an irony in todays vote in conclusion i would just gently point out to my friends on these benches in the mildest manner possible that theyve got what they wanted the great the good the wise the academic the apolitical the expublic servants and the generals who they strove so hard to protect have come together in their wisdom and given us amendment the lords amendment delaying the boundary changes lord wigley the former plaid cymru leader and one of the peers who tabled the amendment delaying the boundary changes has put out a statement explaining why he thinks that was the right thing to do our amendment tabled by three colleagues lords hart labour rennard libdem and kerr crossbench and carried by to votes has the effect of delaying the changes until because the turmoil caused by the changes in electoral registration systems would make it impossible to secure constituencies of roughly equal voter numbers by experience in northern ireland shows that individual registration will initially lead to a drop in registration which over two or three years may be put right research also shows that there will be differential effects of such a change as they work out in seaside towns university towns and in the inner city areas a considerable amount of work will be needed before to ensure that any boundary changes for elections will be based on correct information scrapping the proposals for the elections also gives an opportunity to think again on the unacceptable proposals put forward for wales which stood to lose of its seats compared to a drop in england constituencies running from denbigh to welshpool totally fail to create a community of interest on which mps can focus their work the delay should also allow parliament to think again in the wake of the scottish referendum result whether there should be more fundamental changes to the constitution including dealing with the west lothian question and the role if any of a reformed upper chamber this should i believe be given to a commission on the constitution with a broad remit including the appropriate votersize for westminster constituencies it is ironic that the unelected second chamber should be the vehicle that today allows the elected house of commons to think again on this most basic aspect of parliamentary democracy and i hope that mps will support our amendment in the lobbies the tory mp jesse norman has been responding to the claims that if the government loses today and david cameron loses the next election it will all be normans fault see pm sadiq khan has finished john thurso a lib dem is speaking now he says he is in favour of the lords amendment ie in favour of delaying boundary changes peter bottomley a conservative asks what the late liberal leader joe grimond would have made of todays vote thurso says he heard grimond many times grimond met his wife in thursos grandparents house he is sure grimond would have approved of what his liberal colleagues were doing heres some twitter comment on the way the debate is going from the house magazines sam macrory from labours diane abbott from the daily expresss patrick oflynn jesse norman and nadhim zahawi led the tory rebellion on lords reform which killed the lords reform bill and led to the lib dems voting against the boundary changes today from the daily mails james chapman from the bbcs ian watson khan says there are six million people missing from the electoral register remember this is the electoral registration bill that they are debating chloe smith the cabinet office minister asks if khan thinks these m people were on the register in the year khan says that is no reason for not trying to get people registered nigel dodds the dup mp intervenes he says cutting the size of the commons would have an imact on the northern ireland assembly khan agrees he says northern ireland would lose of its mps under the boundary changes labours kevan jones intervenes he says the boundary changes are about the tories trying to rig the election they are using karl rove tactics he says khan agrees he says that grant shapps the conservative chairman was in the chamber earlier because of the impact of the debate on his partys fortunes khan says that one reason for the lords amendment is to ensure that the new individual voter registration system has time to bed down back in the debate stewart jackson a conservative asks sadiq khan to accept that the current boundaries are unfair khan says its a bit rich for the tories to lecture labour on fairness heres ann treneman the times sketchwriter on the debate sadiq khan the shadow justice secretary is responding for labour he says that lansleys speech was breathtaking only six months ago the conservatives were saying the lords was so perfect that it should not be changed peter bone a conservative says the lords reform bill was actually passed by the biggest majority seen in this parliament khan says the advice from the clerks in the house of lords saying that the amendment delaying boundary changes was outside the scope of the bill was nonbinding earlier i said this debate would run for three hours see am it will but the key vote on boundary changes will come after two hours jesse norman a conservative and one of the rebels on lords reform intervenes he says lansley has complained about that lords does he accept that the lords would cause even more trouble if they were elected lansley laughs he seems to accept norman has a point but he says he does not want to get into discussing lords reform now lansley says the lords amendment is a democratic travesty it represents an attempt to obstruct the will of the commons he says lansley is still speaking he says the amendment included in the lords was an abuse of process crossbenchers in the lords opposed it by two to one he says james duddridge a conservative intervenes he says the lib dem election manifesto pdf included proposals that would cut the number of mps in the commons by why have the lib dems abandoned that lansley says the lib dems will have to answer that back in the debate labours chris bryant says the conservatives want to cut the cost of politics yet the government will create new peers another this week reportedly each new peer costs a year says bryant how is that justified lansley says if labour had supported the governments plans to reform the lords new peers would not be necessary the tories have failed to strike a deal with the dup according to twitter this is from itvs adrian masters and this is from the suns tom newton dunn lansley says that the government wanted to change boundaries because the current system is unfair there is a huge difference in the size of constituencies without boundary changes the election will be fought on the electoral register he says jack straw the labour former justice secretary accuses lansley of being a tad disingenous john bercow asks him to withdraw disingenous straw says he qualified it with a tad to try to make it acceptable bercow does not accept that straw rephrases he says labour objected to the boundary changes because they were wholly partisan lansley says that it was the prime ministers decision to set aside the ministerial code saying ministers are bound by collective responsibility on this issue this is going to get technical lansley says that mps will first vote to on rejecting the lords amendment if they agree on that ie if the tories win lansley will then move a motion saying that there will be no further votes on the boundary changes that would settle the matter for good he says he says he will be speaking on behalf of the conservative party there is no settled government view on this he says andrew lansley the leader of the commons is opening the debate he says amendment see pm and another amendment were introduced in the lords even though they were outside the scope of the bill ie they were on a topic not supposedly covered by the bill michael fabricant a conservative intervenes does lansley remember that nick clegg used to say he was in favour of the boundary changes on a matter of priniciple do the lib dems no do principle on the th of the month its a good point says lansley mps will be debating various changes to the electoral registration bill made when it was in the lords but the key amendment is this one its the one that would delay the boundary changes until the government or at least the conservative wing of it will be asking mps to take this amendment out for reference heres a chart showing the current state of the parties in the commons conservative labour liberal democrat democratic unionist scottish national sinn fein plaid cymru social democratic amp labour alliance green respect independent speaker amp deputies vacant total the sinn fein mps have not taken their seats the speaker and his deputies do not vote and there is one vacancy so there are votes available that means if everyone were to vote you would need votes to have a majority david cameron is short by almost it is very hard to see how he can win mps will soon begin debating the proposed parliamentary boundary changes technically its a threehour debate on lords amendments to the electoral registration and administration bill but dont be put off by the title it should be a cracker this is david camerons last chance to get the commons to back his plan to cut the number of mps from to in time for the general election both coalition parties agreed to do this but the lib dems have decided to vote against the proposals because the conservatives blocked lords reform here are four reasons were about to witness the most colossal coalition split since it will be the first time weve seen conservative ministers and lib dem ministers vote against each other in the commons on an item that was originally in the coalition agreement we dont know yet how much longterm damage this will do to coalition relations but the debate might reveal some clues the lib dems will be voting with labour relations between the two parties collapsed after but this might mark a modest step towards their improvement there will be a conservative rebellion some tory mps are also going to vote against the boundary changes but at this stage we dont know how many this could decide the result of the next election this is how george eaton puts it in a blog for the new statesman the defeat of the changes means it will be all but impossible for the conservatives to win a majority in under the existing boundaries and assuming a lib dem vote of around per cent the tories require a lead of seven points to win an overall majority compared to a lead of four points under the new boundaries labour by contrast needs a lead of just one point to win a majority under the current system compared to a lead of three points under the new boundaries but we could be in for a surprise with the snp confirming that it will vote against the boundary changes it is very hard to see how the conservatives could win but with tight votes it is unwise to make predictions the dup for example have gone suspiciously quiet in recent days although in the past they have said they are opposed to the boundary changes there are rumours that ministers could be trying to buy them off ill be covering the debate in detail elizabeth truss the education minister has dismissed claims that it is unrealistic to expect nursery staff to look after more children my ministerial colleagues at the department of health dont get asked if they would be willing to perform keyhole surgery she said in a speech confirming plans to relax the adultchild ratios required for nurseries and childminders truss said that the nurseries would only be allowed to relax ratios if they hired highlyqualified staff and she said that her plans were intended to increase the quality of childcare and lower its cost but although some aspects of her proposals were welcomed childcare organisations were mostly critical of the plan to relax adultchild ratios the full text of her speech is available here downing street has said that britain could deploy more than military personnel to north africa to help the french operation against islamist extremists some troops will train soldiers in mali and another will train soldiers in neighbouring countries some personnel are serving on the two c transport planes that have been provided to help the operation and another people are helping to operate the sentinel surveillance aircraft that has also been deployed the snp has confirmed that it will vote against the governments proposed boundary changes after the debate this afternoon with lib dem mps also voting with labour against the plans the conservatives are expected to lose i will be covering the debate in detail when it starts at around pm the high court has heard allegations that british troops in iraq were guilty of killing civilians and terrifying acts of brutality as the press association reports women the elderly and children were among the victims of indiscriminate action following the invasion of iraq according to an page document put before two judges lawyers representing nearly iraqis are seeking a public inquiry into allegations that british interrogators were guilty of a number of unlawful killings as well as incidents of torture in britishcontrolled detention facilities defence secretary philip hammond is investigating the claims through the iraq historic allegations team ihat but public interest lawyers pil which is acting for iraqis say ihat is not sufficiently independent to investigate alleged systemic human rights violations on a huge scale an appeal court has said that the operation of the criminal records system is unlawful and breaches human rights george osborne the chancellor has told mps that he has m from the swiss authorities as part of the deal he struck to ensure that tax is paid on money hidden in swiss bank accounts this is the first payment and eventually osborne hopes to receive bn another endorsement for the truss proposals this is from christian guy managing director of the centre for social justice a conservative thinktank the uks childcare system has for too long been unaffordable inflexible and a barrier into work for parents the measures being brought forward by the government have the potential to help parents of young children who want to work into employment it is crucial that quality is never compromised and we believe these proposed changes can raise entrylevel requirements simplify qualifications and ensure the profession commands greater respect at last ive found an organisation in favour of the truss proposals its the cbi this is from katja hall the cbis head of policy raising staff quality is the key to improving childrens early development so these measures are good news and increasing flexibility on childtostaff ratios is one way of containing costs ministers need to be bolder if they are to tackle the rapidly rising costs and lack of places that parents face the current billion a year system of tax credits free nursery hours childcare vouchers and child benefit is overly complex and wasteful it needs to be simplified and targeted better at preschool children when care is most expensive tapering away as they get older government must work with employers to create effective tax incentives to boost take up of high quality provision and make it easier to set up structured childcare settings in workplaces particularly in areas where educational performance is low and heres some more reaction to the truss proposals from the childcare industry earlier see am i quoted from a statement put out by the national childminding association yesterday it has now released a considered response to the proposals heres an extract its from liz bayram the ncmas joint chief executive todays decision to maintain the current ratio levels for registered childminders will be welcomed by our members and other childminders who have spent months stating their concerns around proposals to increase the number of children a childminder can care for at one time we are relieved that after months of uncertainty the department has listened to the professionals doing the job on a daily basis and will maintain the current ratio however increasing the number of under s a childminder can care for at one time to four and including two babies under months rather than one can only be justified if systems are put in place to support childminders to make the quality judgements needed to ensure each child in their care still receives a high quality experience the plan does not seem to link this change to individual childminders holding higher ofsted gradings minimum qualifications nor the new early years educator role we know many of our members do not use their full ratio level at present because such young children rightly demand high levels of individual attention and care to thrive this is from anand shukla chief executive of the family parenting institute and daycare trust we fully support the governments commitment to improve the quality of childcare by reforming early years qualifications and raising the status of the profession however there is a risk that emphasis on regulatory ratios is distracting attention from the urgent need to tackle high childcare costs the evidence is that changes to ratios would not in practice significantly reduce costs to parents but might have a negative effect on the quality of care children receive onetoone interaction alongside factors such as staff ability and leadership is critical to early childhood development there is no simple trade off where better qualified staff are necessarily able to care for more children it is vital that ratios are not increased to the point that safety is put at risk the government must consult fully on the changes it is proposing drawing on the best available evidence international practice and the expertise of the childcare sector before making any decisions and this is from dame clare tickell chief executive of action for children its essential that children receive high quality care at the earliest stages of their life to set them up with the building blocks for their future and help them reach their potential thats why we welcome todays commitment to invest in a highly skilled workforce and the recognition that staff should be valued for the vital role that they play however children must have dedicated one to one time with staff to help them learn and develop and we would be concerned if this is compromised this is particularly crucial for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children who we know can thrive with intensive and tailored support key to this is having high quality staff who have the time to assess their needs and offer appropriate care and support as a result this will help ensure that all our children are on a level playing field as they grow into adults downing street has confirmed that britain is considering sending up to troops to mali press association said britain is offering to send up to military personnel to help train a west african intervention force in mali downing street said the uk could send up to military personnel to an eu mission to train the malian army number said britain has offered a rollon rolloff ferry to help transport equipment to the french force in mali the number spokesman added on twitter someone has been giving me grief for not posting any positive reaction to the truss childcare announcement if i had found any this morning i would have posted it already but i havent however to keep my twitter friend happy here are a couple of quotes from the dfe press release sent out last night i normally ignore endorsements like this but in the interests of fairness from ros marshall of kidsunlimited relaxing staff ratios will ultimately offer nurseries a degree of flexibility to focus on the best qualified staff and highest standards of care for children and the introduction of childminder agencies will help those sole practitioners who operate to a high standard get the support network they need to thrive and reduce costly registration practices from ben black director of my family care as someone who employs people across various childcare businesses i feel passionately about the issues and about the changes proposed by the government childcare in the uk is very heavily subsidised ultimately by us tax payers in various overcomplicated ways and yet it remains expensiveunaffordable for many we all know that nursery staff given the responsibilities they have and jobs they do are underpaid looking at ratios and in some cases daring to suggest that they be relaxed isnt only sensible its essential yvette cooper the shadow home secretary and shadow minister for women has entered the debate about childcare ratios its treasury questions in the commons now and than at pm theres a statement on mali theres also a minute rule motion and so the boundaries debate will not start until around pm at the start of treasury questions george osborne told mps that he received a cheque for m from the swiss last night as the first installment of the bn hes expecting from a scheme designed to ensure that tax is paid on money hidden in swiss accounts its the first time in history that tax money has come from switzerland to the uk and not the other way round he said elizabeth truss is giving her speech to policy exchange now ill post a summary when ive had a chance to read the full text but ive just heard her address the polly toynbee question polly posed it in the first paragraph of her column today i have challenged elizabeth truss before and today i challenge her again show us oh superminister exactly how you manage all on your own to care for two babies alongside four toddlers we would all enjoy watching you try it on a reality tv show where you illustrate your new costcutting plan and heres what truss said it is telling and i have been asked this question today that im often asked about whether i would be able to look after a certain number of children i think this line of enquiry betrays an attitude about the way we think about childcare that somehow anyone who looks reasonably competent might be able to do the job i dont start from the premise that anyone can be an early educator its a very demanding job that requires great and specialist expertise im not trained to do the job im a politician not an early educator and im equally sure that i would not be able to walk into a class of yearolds and teach them german my ministerial colleagues at the department of health dont get asked if they would be willing to perform keyhole surgery and those at the mod arent asked if they would fancy hopping on a helicopter and going into battle although i do suspect that andrew robathan and mark francois would be up for that you can read all todays guardian politics stories here and all the politics stories filed yesterday including some in todays paper are here as for the rest of the papers heres the politicshome list of top must reads heres the conservativehome roundup of todays politics stories and heres the new statesman list of top comment articles and here are some articles i found particularly interesting roland watson and rachel sylvester in the times paywall say that the conservative vice chairman alok sharma wants big firms to have to publish details about the ethnic breakdown of their staff big companies would be urged to publish the ethnic breakdown of their workforce under conservative plans to help to repair the partys image with black and asian voters david cameron has told the cabinet to come up with policies to appeal to ethnic communities amid fears that without them the party will struggle to win an outright majority one idea would encourage stock exchangelisted companies to state how many ethnic minority employees they have and how many they have recruited over the past year the move comes after tory cabinet ministers were told that mr camerons modernising drive had done little to ease the decadesold antipathy towards the party from ethnic minorities the prime minister is to put himself at the head of a fresh pitch to black and asian communities amid fears that britains changing demographics could rob the tories of key seats unless they act fast alok sharma the tory vicechairman and mp for reading west has been charged by mr cameron with providing ideas one would involve exerting the kind of peer pressure behind the governments recommendation that at least per cent of the boards of ftse companies be made up of women by it could involve ethnic breakdowns at different levels of seniority he told the times daniel martin in the daily mail says kenneth clarke will today announce a uturn on secret courts kenneth clarke will today perform an embarrassing uturn over his plans for secret courts the former justice secretary will announce that judges will be given full control over when to hold secret hearings overturning the original legislation which would have allowed ministers to take these decisions he will also introduce changes to enable judges to revoke secret courts at any point in proceedings james kirkup in the daily telegraph says john bercow the commons speaker has said that david cameron and other party leaders should not block pay rises for mps mr bercow said that mps resent moves by independently wealthy party leaders like the prime minister to prevent increases in their pay currently trying to block rise would not be terribly clever or brave he said the independent parliamentary standards authority is considering mps pay submissions to its review by mps suggest that members believe their salaries should rise by a third to more than the speaker made the comments at a westminster reception last week the daily telegraph has seen a record of his remarks mr bercow said that ipsa should be left alone to decide on any pay rise for mps without interference from the prime minister and other party leaders elizabeth truss tells the times paywall in an interview that she would be happy to send her child to a nursery with a higher adultchild ratio some nurseries have warned that the increase will put the safety of the toddlers in their care at risk however ms truss who employed a private nanny for one of her daughters said she would have no hesitation in handing her two children to a nursery exploiting the new rules she said that only those employing qualified childminders and teachers would be given permission to look after more children ive been to see french nurseries operating with highly qualified professionals and a higher ratio than we have in britain she told the times i would be delighted to send my daughter to that nursery i would be first in line they are really high quality for the record here are todays yougov polling figures labour no change from yougov in the sunday times conservatives no change lib dems down ukip up labour lead points no change government approval down on childcare the labour party has sent me an extensive list of reports and surveys suggesting that increasing childcare ratios would be a mistake heres a selection a story about a leaked internal dfe report saying increasing childcare ratios could lead to a deterioriation in quality an academic ratio saying the best adultchild ratio for twoyearolds is a report saying that deregulation in the netherlands led to childcare costs going up and quality going down and heres some reaction to the truss plans from stephen twigg the shadow education secretary the government isnt listening to parents and isnt listening to what the experts are saying about this under this proposal we could have childminders looking after four oneyearold babies at that age it is vitally important that children are getting proper care and attention i dont think its right to change this at the moment its three and the government would make it four it would undermine quality in our childcare from neil leitch chief executive of the preschool learning alliance which describes itself as the largest representative organisation of childcare and early years providers in england we are absolutely appalled by this fixation to alter ratios despite the fact that those working in the sector are universally opposed to the proposal this as a recipe for disaster and i hope those making this decision will be as enthusiastic in answering questions from concerned parents and the media when the consequences of their actions come to the fore from purnima tanuku chief executive of the national day nurseries association quality of childcare and early education must not be sacrificed we welcome the commitment made by government in more great childcare to build on and drive up quality in early years but changes to the number of children individual nursery workers can look after should only be considered if backed by strong evidence from the uk many parents do not want an increase in the number of children nursery staff are allowed look after they are worried it will have a negative impact on the individual attention and care their child receives we are particularly concerned about suggestions to increase the number of children under three that nursery staff can look after due to the degree of personal attention needed by very young children strong adultchild interactions are vital for good child development staff with higher qualifications will still find it difficult to give larger groups of under threes the level of practical care they need it is particularly important that the governments investment in free places for disadvantaged two year olds is delivered in highquality provision from chis keates general secretary of the nasuwt teaching union the nasuwt has called consistently for more effective action to be taken to enhance the skills of the early years workforce and to improve the often highly unattractive pay and conditions of staff in the sector however planning to seek to secure higher qualification and pay levels within the workforce by sacrificing appropriate adult to children ratios is a flawed strategy it is more likely that any increased revenues gained by reducing ratios will simply be diverted to increasing profit margins rather than to enhancing the pay and conditions of staff and the quality of provision for children the simple fact is that in many of the countries cited by the government such as france the costs of childcare are broadly comparable with those in england the critical difference is that the level of state support for childcare is much higher thereby reducing the price that parents are required to pay from a statement the national childminding association put out yesterday ncma has actively campaigned with member support to retain individual childminder regulation and inspection individual inspection matters campaign and highlight the risks of government proposals to increase adult to child ratios in childminding settings recent media coverage has indicated some success with shifts in government thinking but until the formal response is made nothing is certain from frances ogrady the tuc general secretary childcare in this country is far too expensive fails to fit around peoples working lives and is undervalued as a profession by cutting tax credits freezing child benefit and withdrawing it for higher earners the government has made childcare even more unaffordable the closure of hundreds of sure start centres despite promising to protect them has also made it harder to access affordable places but deregulating childcare is not the solution it will not reduce costs and instead risks reducing the quality of care we need significant investment in childcare and wide reaching reform todays announcement fails on both grounds and will not be welcomed by parents were already covered the main points of the truss announcement but there are more details in a news release issued by the department for education its not on the dfes website yet but heres an extract summarising the proposals european countries such as france and denmark recognise that looking after children is an extremely important job and that attitude is reflected in higher levels of skills and pay in contrast professor cathy nutbrown said in her review of childcare qualifications about england too many people who work with young children are underqualified and the system for qualifications is confusing and inadequate this cannot continue if we are expected to compete in a global market and we want to provide children with a complete and fulfilled education the first step in doing this is to make sure qualifications for the early years workforce are rigorous and more demanding secondly we propose to allow nurseries to relax ratios only where they hire highly qualified staff nurseries without highly qualified staff will need to stick to existing ratios thirdly we will set up childminding agencies who will offer a one stop shop service for childminders taking care of business practicalities and quality assurance for parents fourth ofsted will be the only arbiter of quality reducing the burden on las from doing their own inspections and saving them money so more can go to the frontline fifth by abolishing the requirement on schools to register separately with ofsted if they want to provide care and education for children under the age of three we will make it easier formore schools tooffer childcare and early education in the news release the dfe also includes charts saying what the nursery and childminder adultchild ratios are in england and in other countries heres the chart for nurseries and heres the chart for childminders elizabeth truss has been giving interviews this morning and politicshome have been monitoring them here are the main points shes been making truss said she wanted childcare regulation to focus more on quality issues than quantity issues we regulate the wrong thing rather than focusing on quality we focused on quantity and if you look at other european countries they look at how qualified are the staff so do they have good qualifications and literacy and numeracy are they properly trained to work in nurseries theres been more of a focus on professionalism and giving autonomy to nurseries to use their professional judgment and thats the direction i want us to move in so i want us to move in the direction of continental european countries she said she wanted to increase the availability of childcare she said she wanted more government childcare funding to go to the frontline a lot of money gets lost in the system some of it is in duplication at the moment local authorities and ofsted both regulate childcare were saying from now on its just going to be ofsted more money can go front line to make parents fees cheaper she said that plans to give parents financial support with childcare had not been shelved it hasnt fizzled out she said it is coming she also denied that the coalition was split on this there have been reports that families could get up to a year to help with the costs of childcare but this announcement is not coming today elizabeth truss the education minister is giving a speech this morning announcing plans to overhaul childcare rules but as happens at westminster most of the details have been briefed already my colleague patrick wintour fleshes them out in a story in todays guardian elizabeth truss the early years minister is to propose that childminders currently restricted to looking after three children per staff member from the ages of one to five inclusive should be allowed in future to look after four children they would also be permitted to look after two children under one year of age instead of the current one truss will seek to allay parents fears of their children being neglected by overpressed staff pointing out that the relaxation she proposes still leaves more restrictive ratios than denmark france and germany three countries often seen as providing high quality care for preschool children the minister will quote experts claiming that in britain more qualifications are needed to look after animals than toddlers she is also proposing that nurseries be allowed to relax their ratios when qualified staff are present so that instead of one staff member to four children aged two the number would rise to one to six in the case of oneyearolds the permitted staff to child ratios would rise from the current onetothree to onetofour the ratios would rise further if a fullyqualified teacher is present she will also relax how these rules are interpreted this morning ill be focusing on the speech and the reaction to the truss proposals in her guardian column this morning my colleague polly toynbee says they could lead to warehousing not care and then starting at about pm or later if there is an urgent question on childcare which is very possible mps will start the debate on boundary changes ill be covering that in detail it should run for three hours and is likely but not certain to result in a conservative defeat heres the agenda for the day am lord wilson the former cabinet secretary gives evidence the commons public administration committee about the civil service former ministers sir nick harvey nick herbert caroline spelman and lord adonis are also giving evidence at am am the national association of pension funds gives evidence to the commons treasury committee about quantitative easing am

committee on pakistan around pm mps begin a debate on proposed boundary changes that would cut the size of the house of commons originally both coalition parties were in favour of cutting the number of mps from to but today the lib dems will vote with labour to block the plans the conservatives who still want the boundary changes to go through are likely to lose although theoretically they could win with support from mps from the minor parties ill be covering the debate in detail as usual ill also be covering all the breaking political news as well as looking at the papers and bringing you

a relaxation in the number of preschool children that nurseries and registered childminders can oversee will be announced on tuesday as part of a move to professionalise the preschool workforce and cut the cost of childcare in england elizabeth truss the early years minister is to propose that childminders currently restricted to looking after three children per staff member from the ages of one to five inclusive should be allowed in future to look after four children they would also be permitted to look after two children under one year of age instead of the current one truss will seek to allay parents fears of their children being neglected by overpressed staff pointing out that the relaxation she proposes still leaves more restrictive ratios than denmark france and germany three countries often seen as providing high quality care for preschool children the minister will quote experts claiming that in britain more qualifications are needed to look after animals than toddlers she is also proposing that nurseries be allowed to relax their ratios when qualified staff are present so that instead of one staff member to four children aged two the number would rise to one to six in the case of oneyearolds the permitted staff to child ratios would rise from the current onetothree to onetofour the ratios would rise further if a fullyqualified teacher is present she will also relax how these rules are interpreted the flexibility has been welcomed by many childminders organisations but labelled unacceptable and a recipe for disaster by the preschool learning alliance the largest representative organisation of early years providers the department for education said the proposals were dependent on staff possessing higher qualifications including grade c gcse maths and english the dfe said englands relatively tight ratios have two main effects higher costs for parents and lower pay for staff in turn low pay drags down the quality of the workforce in other countries providers can use the extra income they get from taking on more children to reduce fees for parents and pay staff more but this is not possible in england truss is also to propose that one stop shop child agencies be given more freedom to help homebased childminders but labour has attacked the proposals shadow education secretary stephen twigg said experts are warning this could threaten child safety and wont reduce costs parents will be worried truss will tell the policy exchange thinktank we have seen a decrease in the number of childminders over recent years this is in part because childminders have to be business owners some people want a simpler way to enter the profession and parents want to be assured of quality so we are setting up one stop shops called childminder agencies to do the practicalities and to give parents some reassurance over quality she added she would introduce graduatelevel early years teachers specifically trained to teach young children only of nursery staff and of homebased childminders are qualified to alevel standard or equivalent her controversial announcement is a precursor to a wider set of proposals to help families with the cost of childcare

i have challenged elizabeth truss before and today i challenge her again show us oh superminister exactly how you manage all on your own to care for two babies alongside four toddlers we would all enjoy watching you try it on a reality tv show where you illustrate your new costcutting plan most childminders have modest homes regulations say they dont need a garden but must take their charges out once a day how do you manage your double buggy with four toddlers on leads can you get six in a car or on the bus to the park or library how do you manage journeys to nursery school and back we need you to show us how you do it as you plan to deregulate childcare increase childstaff ratios and reduce or remove childminder inspections though your speech talks so beguilingly of improving quality on tuesday the childrens minister announces her new plan called more great childcare her policy has an admirable intention to increase the number of childcare places and cut costs to get more mothers back to work british mothers have one of the lowest employment rates in the oecd because we have the third most expensive childcare sometimes of mediocre calibre but that quality is in danger of getting worse as her new rules will let nurseries have a stafftochild ratio that allows more babies while childminders on their own can have again with more babies no doubt children can be kept safe fed and reasonably clean but this risks becoming warehousing not care there has been such an outcry that the ministers tone has changed from her original brash proposal a member of the rightwing free enterprise group she earned this ministerial post with her chapter in the groups britannia unchained book promising to magic up cheaper childcare with no extra money she uses often deceptive foreign comparisons where other countries with far better qualified staff and big state subsidies seem to allow higher staffchild ratios indeed some have no official fixed number when norway is quoted its figures conveniently omit nursery assistants from staffing figures yet an extra pair of even unqualified hands makes all the difference the minister may expect childminders to relish taking on more children to earn extra fees but the national childminding association to which belong says its members are strongly opposed they have raised a petition only the least scrupulous would consider it says the chief executive though ms truss has drummed up a handful of tame supporters nursery world magazine reports almost the entire sector against the daycare trust says goodquality care just cant be delivered on higher ratios the national day nurseries association speaking for the private sector is not in favour either though half of private nurseries are making next to no profit this year the ministers advisers sound on the back foot the ratios are purely voluntary they say no one has to take in more toddlers besides the minister is raising quality by raising qualifications so more staff must have c grades in gcse english and maths a new earlyyears educators qualification will be set at level alevel approximately however what proportion of nursery staff need any of these is up for consultation everyone agrees that nursery staff lack vital professional training but with average pay of an hour and supervisors earning only how do you raise staff quality and status without higher pay in new research policy exchange the centreright thinktank where truss is making her announcement finds what everyone knows in poor areas childcare is worse for the obvious reason that hardup mothers can only choose by price the best nurseries are mostly in affluent areas where mothers can afford better policy exchange rightly suggests that state funding go towards children who need it most with incentives for top graduates to join teach first a charity that works with schools in deprived areas all the voluminous research shows that its deprived children who gain most from the best nursery teaching which has far less impact on children who already have books conversation and encouragement at home that goes to the heart of a hot dispute inside government does it target funds at children who need it most or use universal childcare vouchers to appease higher earners for their lost child benefit the signs are that george osborne will choose political advantage unsurprisingly the tories are behind among women voters so offering all mothers a voucher worth over a year looks more electorally appealing than wasting extra on poor mothers who never vote conservative the institute for public policy research and the resolution foundation are calling for good childcare that is universal and free something labour should have done from the first this they suggest can be paid for by freezing child benefit for years others suggest the pension tax relief of the welloff would be a better source either way it can be done truss is right that childcare is in crisis state funds and fees dont cover the cost a cats cradle of funding streams is so complex many mothers dont get the money they are due many nurseries are near bankrupt and only are state run the best beacon training centres the quality of ofsted inspections is doubtful and some care is almost as rockbottom as the pay labours best programme sure start childrens centres staggers under cuts with shut down and half sad shells offering no childcare the early intervention grant for local authorities has been raided time and again last week michael gove stole more millions for his adoption scheme bold announcements to give deprived twoyearolds nursery places turned out to be stolen from the same fund many nurseries say they cant afford to offer twoyearolds places anyway as the ringfence is removed cashstrapped councils divert it from childcare and respite care for disabled children to pay for basic services lets hear no more pieties from cameron and clegg about social mobility when they both know the evidence the extreme inequality of british society is almost insurmountable but the best hope of changing life chances is intense family support from a friendly local childrens centre with infants at the best nurseries with welltrained teachers packed in with just one minder for six toddlers many will be strapped into high chairs in front of the tv minister truss if you know any other

free a fifth had reduced the number of qualified teachers and a further reported they would have to reduce childcare staff that report concluded that despite heavy cuts many local authorities had tried to protect sure start funding and childrens centres were a picture of resilience and creativity but children warned that this impressive fortitude may not be sustainable in the long run the

new figures show that people living in the most deprived areas are receiving worse childcare than those in wealthy areas the policy exchange report finding comes as the early years minister liz truss prepares to relax rules restricting the number of children childminders can look after the coalition has yet to finalise plans to help with the cost of childcare as the liberal democrats work to ensure the scheme contains elements to help poorer families experts warned the lib dems that the original plan was likely to be regressive both nick clegg and david cameron are eager to be seen as helping working women a vital part of the electorate the policy exchange report due to be presented to truss at the beginning of next week will propose extending teach first provision to early years the charity helps attract bright graduates into teaching especially in deprived areas a requirement for councils to publish quality of provision and simplification of the childcare element of the working tax credit the resolution foundation has also produced a report showing the extent to which the cost of childcare is a major deterrent for women to return to work the policy exchange report shows that over threequarters of childminders were judged good or outstanding by ofsted last year compared with only of childminders working in more deprived areas yougov polling of people carried out for policy exchange also shows that wealthier parents are much more likely to choose childcare provision based on quality rather than simply on cost nearly half of people earning less than consider cost an important factor when choosing childcare compared to of people earning between under half of people earning less than said that quality of childcare provider was important when choosing childcare providers compared with of people earning between and the polling also found that most parents compared with would not swap childcare provider if they were to raise the ratio of children per childcare worker truss is expected to recommend that the ratio be increased to improve the pay and career prospects of childcare staff the policy exchange report will urge the government to put fresh impetus on improving the quality of early years teaching academic studies have shown that although better qualified childcare staff improve the outcomes for children only one in childminders and just over one in five daycare staff hold a qualification above an alevel equivalent the report will propose extending teach first to early years to attract bright graduates especially in the more deprived areas of the country teach first in schools has been deemed hugely successful at present ofsted carries out inspections every four years while local authorities have no obligation to publish data about the quality of childcare providers in their area the report will say the government could make at least m worth of savings by reducing error and fraud in the childcare element of working tax

for an institution whose death has been so widely and frequently predicted the family is displaying an extraordinary resilience ingenuity and a capacity to modernise for the sake of its own survival last week for instance the government revealed its controversial gay marriage bill permitting same sex couples to say i do a historic event the family is nothing if not wedded to metamorphosis the practices and philosophy of parenthood are adjusting as rapidly last week the office for national statistics revealed a significant increase in women becoming mothers in their s while stay at home fathers now amount to of fulltime carers whether this growth is a matter of choice or of necessity dictated by unemployment or cost of childcare or both what is lagging desperately behind is the ability of the modern state to define what role it should play in supporting the family faced with this accelerating social change what kind of ethos will most effectively shape family policy in the st century on tuesday charities and organisations including children and the social networking site netmums provide their own answer they are calling on the chancellor george osborne to treat families in his forthcoming comprehensive spending review as a special case they rightly argue that families are facing an unprecedented squeeze as a result of benefit cuts rising food and fuel prices and childcare costs the fairfamilies campaign is asking osborne for a triple lock similar to that which pensioners currently enjoy the triple lock for families consists of no further service cuts no further benefit reductions and policies that put families at the heart of growth strategy it is very likely that mr osborne will deal with fairfamilies in much the same way as many traditional fathers behaved towards their children seeing but not hearing from the th century on the state has had a permanent seat at the family table while never properly clarifying what its role should be nanny in loco parentis the right can view the state as an intruder the left can expect the state to be a protector against the familys worst excesses in for the first time government tried to carve a middle path in a green paper supporting families a labour government promised advice a reduction in child poverty a better balance between work and home and a pledge to tackle domestic violence truancy and schoolage pregnancy in some areas it made headway in child poverty and teenage pregnancy for instance in others it failed in part because of two major weaknesses which continue to dog family policy today the first is to do with paid work and light touch timidity towards those in business and industry who refuse to modernise their attitudes about the kind of workplace arrangements they encourage and the impact they have on family life as sheryl sandberg chief operating officer of facebook told an audience at the world economic forum in davos we all know about the overt discrimination the lack of flexibility we know but since the s too little has changed fathers are still written off if they seek shorter hours while women could be sacked in pregnancy companies such as the national grid barclays and bt manage to flourish while moulding work to family life so why not others the second challenge is the paternalism of the welfare settlement unchanged for several decades ed miliband is said to be interested in what is called the relational state a philosophy that requires the public sector to work collaboratively with families and not treat them as children constantly told what to do and encouraging dependency a relational approach means assessing a familys capabilities long before their failings failings often triggered by practical issues such as lack of income and unemployment hilary cottam founder of participle a company involved in public service reform has described what this traditional toxic approach meant for working with troubled families in swindon these were in receipt of services from different departments yet social workers spent only of their time in practical help and of their time on paperwork the family cost taxpayers a year but cottam points out not one penny of the money actually supports change the system is a costly gyroscope that spins round the families keeping them at the heart stuck exactly where they are this form of crisis management expensive and frequently ineffectual dominates much of family policy whether its support for a couple bringing up a severely disabled child or an older person housebound and many miles away from his or her extended family what families need instead is proactive early help combined with service inventiveness fewer professional silos and more pooled budgets family policy in the st century has to be part of a new welfare settlement similar to that which in heralded the nhs for that to happen innovation has to be welcomed andy burnham shadow health secretary should have been applauded therefore when last week he initiated a debate on a unified service that elevates prevention and combines health mental health and social care into a streamlined single service the crossparty talks that marked his first attempt to broach this vital issue should be revived universal free childcare has to be championed by labour as the central plank of a prospering society today the mosaic that is family life has never been richer or more diverse it includes for instance mothers who have never lived with the father of their child septuagenarians newly divorced after years of marriage gay

centenarians in the american writer christopher lasch wrote the modern world intrudes at every point the sanctity of the home is a sham in a world dominated by giant corporations and by the apparatus of mass promotion the same forces that have impoverished work and civic life invade the private realm and its last stranglehold the family the miracle is that no matter what its makeup however

many women are glad that the academic mary beard has spoken out about the foul misogynistic insults that were hurled at her on the internet after her appearance on question time one or two women query the idea that speaking out is the right strategy arguing that the most efficient way of dealing with bullies is to ignore them the implication here of course is that speaking out is the problem no actually speaking out is not the problem however since women do speak out about misogynistic abuse with great regularity changing nothing it might be time to accept that speaking out is not the solution either it doesnt take a great analytical talent to parse the insults directed at beard and conclude that their general thrust is against the idea that she has intelligence and status and in favour of the idea that she is wrong not to do her best to look as attractive and sexually available as possible in other words these critics would prefer beard and no doubt all women to be concerned only with valuing themselves as the passive objects of their possible sexual attention its not a giant leap to assume that were the men doling out this abuse living in satisfying relationships they wouldnt be hunkered over the web superimposing vulvas on to the noses of historians and sharing it with likeminded chums on a website designed for the purpose these men are surely intensely dissatisfied with themselves and their lives and blame women for it its easy to see why they would many women subscribe to the idea that feminism has transformed their lives and opportunities i do myself however i also believe the influence of feminism on contemporary society is overstated there are two unfortunate consequences one is that many women have an inflated view of the practical efficacy of feminism and continue to place uncritical hope in it another is that many men have a similarly inflated view and see feminism and the women who seem to have benefited richly from it as the focus of their angry feelings of failure and rejection feminisms main benefit to women i suggest has been psychological womens lives today are so very different to those of women in the past largely as a consequence of technological and economic change feminism has given women confidence and support in adjusting to those changes it has also had a positive influence on shaping the detail of those changes but it didnt for the most part actually cause them beard is a don at cambridge before that wasnt allowed sure feminism played a huge role in gaining equal access to education for women but so did a growing and intensifying economic shift in britain away from manual labour to intellectual labour likewise that move away from manual labour resulted in fewer men having jobs that made huge physical demands on them demands that made it seem sensible that they should be untroubled by any expectation of domestic contribution its one thing to have dinner on the table for a man who is drained and exhausted by a long and arduous shift in a shipyard but quite another if that man has spent the day working in the shop down the road from the shop you work in yourself because of course mothers started going out to work in great numbers at exactly the same time not only as feminism but also at the same time as their husbands started losing that tiring but relatively wellpaid work in heavy industry yet just as women are a bit too fond of thanking feminism for a service economy that seeks to employ educated women sometimes men are too fond of blaming it for the same thing these men think that if women hadnt insisted on equality and independence theyd still have their wellpaid jobs and their wives would be at home warming their slippers and making sure the menfolk werent too troubled by the babies that were an inevitable result of the sexondemand they deserved as breadwinners thats a powerful delusion its also part of why pornography became mainstream as this societal change filtered through its not just male fantasies about what sex should be like that are flattered its fantasies about what life as a whole should be like hence the page girl is often defended as a way of giving wellpaid work to young women who dont have other opportunities shes really in the pages of the sun to comfort men who share some views with the men who go on the web actively to denigrate women but this defence of her choices is also an acknowledgement that many women like many men still dont have much choice and where they can choose often make choices that feminism doesnt approve of even its most ardent supporters will admit feminism has helped middleclass women the most no wonder for middleclass women there was a door to push at with middleclass men on the other side keen to open it just a crack and let some female graduates through the door to be their secretaries or managers big opportunities for intellectual work in the professions actually existed so could be fought for parttime lowpaid work for women was always there as long as women didnt let it interfere with looking after their husbands and their kids with men on the hunt for the same sort of work wages and conditions were depressed yet further now when an idealised nuclear household is expected to contain two adults without much earning power and with childcare costs so high its not surprising that so many women choose or are left to go it alone at the other end of the spectrum dualincome professionals have played havoc with the property market economically feminism can only achieve for women the opportunities the system can provide as i say it has done a marvellous job in supporting women who have the skills to grasp those opportunities middleclass men though they had that stuff already and though so many saw the inherent fairness of feminist arguments they set up no networks that helped men to manage change and developed no ideology of solidarity with other men however imperfect a lot of men simply fought a rearguard action to hang on to the best of what they already had powerful men generally succeeded dispossessed men often failed and if they wanted to turn their anger on women not on the men whod been at the top of the heap all along pulling the strings well bingo deflection so much the better for the kingpins many men who have been hurt by the technological and economic change that feminism helped women to thrive in see only that they dont have fancy jobs while women do women who complain that they still dont have enough all these men have is time paradoxically gifted to them by the advance of the technologies that helped to make them obsolete as workers and as fathers they hunch over those technologies their tellies their computers and spew hate at women unable to see that the destructive force that has beaten them down is generally referred to not as women but as growth and progress time to speak out definitely but we need to say a

government plans to strip councils of responsibility for adoption if they are slow to find new families for children could be damaging to vulnerable youngsters critics claim councils said the proposed shakeup dubbed heavy handed and unnecessary by heads of childrens services would adversely affect not just children but potential adoptive parents critics have pointed out that the m set aside by the education secretary michael gove to fund adoption support had been taken out of council budgets for sure start childrens centres and family support projects the move they said would lead to the possible close of services designed to prevent children being taken into care in the first place the proposals were described as shorttermist headline grabbing by the labour mp graham allen an adviser to the prime minister on family intervention a statement this morning by the childrens minister edward timpson said that councils which took too long to find families for children in care would be stripped of their powers the task handed over to private agencies and charities timpson said we have identified some significant structural weaknesses which undermine the effectiveness of the adopter recruitment and approval system these weaknesses must be addressed swiftly and decisively in the interests of a significant and sustainable increase in the number of adopters if councils did not raise their game the secretary of state would use proposed powers to intervene then strip them of responsibility for adoption he said timpson added we recognise that this is a radical step if local authorities are able to bring forward alternative proposals that would deliver a similarly radical shift in the systems capacity then we will not need to use this power the initiative is the latest bid by gove to speed up the adoption process which is often held up by bureaucratic hurdles and a shortage of prospective adopters the local government association lga warned against the move saying it should only be considered as a very last resort david simmonds chair of the lgas children and young people board said recent figures show councils have twice the success rate of independent adoption agencies removing councils from the process of recruiting and screening potential adopters could adversely impact on the very children and potential adoptive parents the government is trying to protect and should only be considered as a very last resort he claimed the proposals risked creating a disjointed and confusing system with potential adopters passed from pillar to post as different agencies became responsible for different parts of the process with the national shortage of potential adopters we are currently facing the last thing we want to do is put potential mums and dads off making such a lifechanging decision he said debbie jones president of the association of directors of childrens services adcs said the challenge from ministers to recruit more adopters was welcomed but she added that adcs strongly opposed plans to give the education secretary powers to take away a councils right to recruit adopters she said at a time when more adopters are needed taking the power away from the largest current supplier of adopters is ill thought through and the paper presents no evidence that it will have the effect they intend adcs members have been a driving force behind adoption reform and this threat is heavy handed and unnecessary allen an expert on family intervention who has written two reports on the subject for david cameron said the adoption initiative was funded by cutting council programmes now supported by an early intervention grant eig including sure start short breaks for disabled children and support for families with multiple needs this adoption strategy funds a headline but at the cost of undermining existing early intervention programmes which help the social and emotional development of all babies children and young people we all support adoption but to do so by robbing existing childrens programmes reeks of the shorttermist headline grabbing that is exactly the wrong way to take proven programmes to scale mark rogers chief executive of solihull council and chair of the childrens and education policy network for the society of local authority chief executives solace called the proposed powers disproportionate and prescriptive latest figures show children in england are left in care for nearly months on average before they are adopted in some areas youngsters are forced to wait almost three years before moving

we knew already that the m of council money topsliced by education secretary michael gove would be taken from budgets earmarked for local sure start centres and parenting support projects we now know what that money will be spent on goves personal crusade on adoption a department for education statement this morning made clear that the cash which has been diverted from local authority early intervention grant funding streams will be redistributed to local authorities in march with the clear direction that they must spend it on unblocking and speeding up the adoption system this morning there was an explosion of opposition to goves proposal perhaps the most curious thing was that the people criticising it seem on the whole to have absolutely no quarrel with the education secretary over the idea that adoption as part of an array of approaches to support vulnerable children should be regarded as a priority take graham allen a labour mp who is also chair of the early intervention foundation allen is a thoughtful man who has made common cause with political opponents like iain duncan smith over tackling social exclusion he has produced two official reports on family intervention for the prime minister david cameron allen did not mince his words this morning this is whitehall taking money from local councils and saying we know best follow our priorities not your own so much for localism it is also unclear whether this money will be spent on evidenced based policies that work or on ministerial pet projects which are the bane of reflex policy making directed from whitehall councils will have to reduce spending on early intervention programmes that they judge are right in their circumstances these include sure start help for babies short breaks for disabled children and support for families with multiple needs this funds a headline but at the cost of undermining existing early intervention programmes which help the social and emotional development of all babies children and young people we all support adoption but to do by robbing existing childrens programmes reeks of the short termist headline grabbing that is exactly the wrong way to take proven programmes to scale the centrepiece of goves adoption strategy is a threat he will legislate to give himself powers to intervene in councils who fail to speed up the adoption system poor performers will be stripped of their power to recruit adopters and responsibility transferred to charities and private companies this said childrens minister edward timpson was a radical step but also he suggested a last resort if local authorities are able to bring forward alternative proposals that would deliver a similarly radical shift in the systems capacity then we will not need to use this power childrens services directors were not impressed even though they support the broad thrust of goves adoption reforms debbie jones president of the association of directors of childrens services adcs responded at a time when more adopters are needed taking the power away from the largest current supplier of adopters is ill thought through and the paper presents no evidence that it will have the effect they intend adcs members have been a driving force behind adoption reform and this threat is heavy handed and unnecessary local authorities should be encouraged to recruit as many suitable adopters as possible and not do this difficult task with a ministerial sword of damocles hanging over them it will be confusing and demoralising for prospective adopters and local authority adoption staff alike cllr david simmonds the tory chair of the local government association children and young people board and yes a supporter of the increased focus on adoption was equally frustrated he claimed that councils were twice as successful at finding prospective adoptive parents than independent agencies and the local authorities have overseen a increase over the last months in the number of children adopted simmonds said this move risks creating a disjointed and confusing system which could see potential adopters passed from pillar to post as different agencies become responsible for different parts of the process at the heart of these angry rebukes is an intense frustration among people at the front line of childrens services that their attempts to manage huge cuts in childrens social care at a time when demands on those services are increasing are being grotesquely undermined by ministerial grandstanding the shift to central control of local spending from a government that preaches localism is frustrating tory and labour councillors alike first there was nick cleggs bn free education for two year olds pledge this was hyped as new money it transpired it was being cut from councils early intervention budgets over the next two years and now there is goves adoption directive again not new money and a move one childrens services cabinet member ruefully described to me this morning as stalinist micromanagement politics aside there is a more profound worry that the net effect of these distant ministerial decrees is to hamper the efforts of councils on the ground to tackle a wider and much more troubling crisis the extraordinary and consistent increase in children being taken into care the childrens charity barnardos reported this week that over that over youngsters in england were waiting for adoption the highest total since that may be in part because councils cannot recruit enough adoptive parents but it also reflects the rising tide of children coming into the care system earlier this month cafcass the childrens guardian service revealed care applications in england to take children into care were at record levels standing at over over the nine months to december goves initiative say councillors takes cash out of services that are designed to prevent family crisis and reduce demand on childrens social services it then puts that cash into a service that cannot keep pace with the costly consequences of family crisis this is daft say goves critics but dont just take their word for it heres what it says about early intervention on goves own departmental website intervening early is the best way of preventing bigger and more expensive problems later on there is immense potential in combining a reduction in central prescription with a stronger focus on what works for different localities people on the ground are frustrated by goves heavyhandedness the mixed messages about localism and what might be called administrative competence issues the way the timing of the announcement so close to the new financial year gives councils so little time to plan ahead properly if local government treated its subcontractors this way wed be clattered all over the courts one councillor told me but what enrages them most is what they see as the shorttermist unstrategic robbingpetertopaypaul nature of goves crusade as cllr ralph berry lead member for childrens services on bradford council told me if you pull the money out of early intervention you will end up with more children who will need to be adopted because you will have lost the services that prevent children and families getting into that situation update january the nspcc has also criticised goves strategy tom rahilly looked after children lead at the child protection charity said whilst we welcome more support for adoption it simply doesnt make sense to take the money from the early intervention pot this funding actually helps stop family breakdown which often leads to the need for adoption in the first place early help was a key recommendation of the munro review supported by ministers just months ago investing in

paris lees at college most people thought feminist meant manhater there were plenty of feminists on tv in the early s and i always sided with these tough ladies the ones that didnt see men as their superiors raised by my mum my gran and my aunty and bullied by a father i despised childme was certain that women couldnt be the inferior gender teenage me wondered why there even have to be an inferior gender or in fact gender at all couldnt we all just do our own thing and be nice to each other at college most people thought feminist meant manhater this excluded men from feminism including me because at the time i looked like a boy it was a figurative kick in the teeth being born male but when i was younger i also got actual kicks in the face for acting girly feminists have long fought to protect women from violence and i wish more of those with big platforms would discuss the very real abuse trans people suffer often daily early into my transition i read germaine greers the whole woman it contained polemics about trans women in female toilets suggesting we were men pretending to be women trying to invade womens spaces its good to read authors one disagrees with greer caused me to question my identity and form a more complex one she was right i am not a woman in the way my mother is i havent experienced female childhood i dont menstruate i wont give birth yes i have no idea what it feels like to be another woman but nor do i know what it feels like to be another man how can anyone know what it feels like to be anyone but themselves strangely thanks to greer i now know that i am happiest as me i do feel sorry for some of the feminist old guard though that fire they had in their bellies that righteous indignation it must be a shock to find theyve joined the ranks of a chattering establishment complicit in the oppression of others im sure they never planned it im trans and feminist most of my female friends in their s are feminist too though few call it that we see ourselves as equal to others even if they dont we struggle to earn the same as our male peers to be heard as much to see as much of ourselves in public and political life but weve progressed through feminism and the idea that people should be treated equally despite what fate pops between your legs at birth who wouldnt support that as dale spender so eloquently puts it feminism has fought no wars it has killed no opponents it has set up no concentration camps starved no enemies and practised no cruelties its battles have been for education for the vote for better working conditions for safety on the streets for childcare for social welfare for rape crisis clinics womens refuges reforms in the laws if someone says oh im not a feminist i ask why whats your problem well heres the thing the trans movement fuelled by the radical notion that trans people are valid humans hasnt fought any wars either no killing no concentration camps our battles are for dignity not to be ridiculed abused and murdered for who we are to have our privacy respected by the media to be free from harassment under the law free to use the toilet free to pee paris lees is editor of meta a unique digital magazine that celebrates gender diversity she is also acting assistant editor at gay times jane fae feminism as academic dogma is a very cold fish the process of gender transitioning never ends along the way i have experienced joy and sadness most joyful perhaps is a sense that pervades and prevails over all the rest im home speaking it now i could weep at that simple truth recognising though i had never been there before a place that in my heart i never left womanhood i am home to a place where people speak share support and engage emotionally in ways that feel as natural as breath times two for feminism where theres all that and common purpose too women from all walks of life all classes ethnicities orientations and history are joined to support each other as best they can those with power and privilege lending it to those without those without banding together to create their own strength there is something magnificent about it something strong and resilient too i didnt get this before my transition because feminism as creed or academic dogma is a very cold fish indeed the impulse is to engage with it intellectually except that by engaging intellect alone too often the point is missed feminism needs to be lived then theres privilege ah yes i had that once living as a guy i was safer less subject to random street assault better able to maintain my personal space not judged on my looks all major pluses but apart from not ever really being a guy i missed out workwise careerwise and socially by spending too much energy on trying to live a role i didnt understand thats gone now being home i function better life works it has slotted into place do i mind my loss of privilege of course but ive not joined the feminist bandwagon to get it back as if i know i have privilege that nontrans women dont but i also endure oppressions that are pretty much unique to women of trans history women have different pasts you see different lived experience but our lives also have many similarities some wrongs that i never experienced before i experience now from being patronised and sidelined in meetings to feeling fear when walking alone late at night others i hope i never will the extremes of despair that result from economic degradation domestic abuse and humiliation for that too is the point i can and do campaign on issues where i personally have been wronged but i have a voice and empathy to use for other women in different situations from mine i am not here to lead or to lecture but to join and to share i have come home i will defend it as fiercely and as long as i am able jane fae is a feminist and writer on issues of political and sexual liberty cl minou feminism is an inclusive force i remain an optimist when it comes to feminism and my own occasionally problematic place within it perhaps its because i have to believe that the struggle to improve the lives of women wont leave me behind and that if feminism is the radical belief that women are people then theres room for the radical belief that trans women are people too i believe in a feminism that recognises that oppression against one is oppression against many and that even within the more narrow scope of misogyny there are always other factors race nationality religion social class age we are all caught in a web of power relationships and as nice as it would be to focus on one strand to the exclusion of others that wont mean that youre any less caught by the rest perhaps because of my age i am a member of generation x i find myself caught between the faithless promises and neverending culture wars of the boomers and the matteroffact egalitarianism of the millennials but in the circles i have walked in feminism is an inclusive force they are feminists who not only accept my womanhood and place in their struggle but are also willing to fight for the particulars of my own helen boyd the writer and activist who organised an online support forum for trans people and their partners is a committed and nononsense feminist who put iron into my previously wishywashy people are equal feminism from helen i came to the writings of bell hooks and julia serano two authors whose books gave me the uncanny sense of finally putting on paper all the inchoate ideas that had been lurking in my own skull these three women were the catalyst for my own writing and activism i think many feminists here in the us remain baffled by the exclusionary and prejudiced attitudes of so many prominent uk feminists perhaps its a cultural difference in north america the vanguard of the s feminists were followed by a group that had to confront the unexamined racial and class bias present in the womens rights movement maybe its because academia has been less important in the civil rights struggle in the us but i really dont see how to paraphrase audre lorde using the masters tools will ever tear down the masters house cl minou writes frequently on feminist and transgendered issues stuart crawford trans people have unique perspectives on sex and gender im a transvestite in that i often wear what are generally deemed womens clothes i dont set out to pass as a woman its just that most people tend to assume that i am one and im disinclined to correct them while often reluctant to describe myself as such i consider myself to be a feminist feminism means different things to different people my own feminism is rooted in my experience of everyday sexism few things open your eyes to the disparity in how men and women are treated than being able to easily flit between gender presentations as a white not visibly disabled man you are default human able to walk the streets with a minimum of hassle as an apparent woman no matter how modestly dressed youre an immediate target for catcalls wolfwhistles and grasping hands i feel relatively safe for all that when i walk in the guise of a woman over the years ive got pretty good at talking my way out of trouble its only when i have to spend time in close quarters with people that the fear sets in fear of how quickly the unwanted sexual attention will turn to violence if im discovered if the wandering hands wander into something they werent expecting to find theres not much that draws out violence like causing people to question their own sexuality misogyny transphobia homophobia these things are interwoven my experiences sensitised me to some of the myriad injustices to which women are constantly subjected they prompted me to discuss them with my female friends and gradually i learned about the ones my experiences hadnt prepared me for the friend who was fired because unlike her coworkers she wasnt prepared to put up with her boss groping her the friend who found she was being candidly photographed by fellow students on her male college course the friend who was raped by a partner the partner who was raped by a member of her family many of these friends are like myself hesitant to label themselves feminists the transphobia of secondwavers isnt just insulting and offensive its also damaging to the feminist movement trans people have unique perspectives on sex and gender and to

the squeeze on tax credits and benefits will push more children into poverty the government has admitted for the first time this suggests that in total a million extra children will be in poverty as a result of government welfare measures the extra children in poverty is a result of the governments decision to lift most inwork and outofwork benefits by only a year over the next three years instead of increasing them in line with inflation ministers had been reluctant to state what the impact would be on child poverty an official government measure of relative poverty that looks at the number of households with incomes at or less than the national average household income but in an answer to a parliamentary question the work and pensions minister esther mcvey estimated that the uprating measures in and will result in around an extra children being deemed by this measure to be in relative income poverty compared to uprating benefits by cpi consumer price index ministers are trying to push through the benefits squeeze with just one day of debate for the committee stage and third reading of the welfare benefits uprating bill in the commons on monday labour said the figures showed children were victims of tory political games ed balls the shadow chancellor said the true character of this conservativeled government has now been exposed while they give the richest of earners a bn tax cut children will be pushed into poverty and millions of working families made worse off ministers have spent weeks refusing to admit what the impact of their policies would be on child poverty and now we know why children are paying the price for david cameron and george osbornes economic failure and the political games they have decided to play liam byrne the shadow work and pensions secretary said the chancellors pathetic little games have real consequences for millions of families struggling to make ends meet ten years of tory party detoxification has been destroyed because the chancellor needed a newyear dividing line and britains poorest children are paying the price the nasty party is well and truly back the child poverty action group cpag also criticised the changes but a department of work and pensions spokesperson said even with plans to limit increases to benefits people will still see their benefits go up year on year there is no freeze in support and universal credit will make m households better off ministers have argued that it is misleading to look at the impact of the benefits uprating move in isolation they have separately said they no longer regard the relative child poverty statistics introduced by labour as a useful or valid measure looking at relative income in isolation is not a helpful measure to track progress towards our target of eradicating child poverty the parliamentary answer said ministers have for some time been arguing that the relative income measure is unhelpful as it focuses on too narrow a definition of poverty the government has introduced a range of additional measures labour points out that david cameron when in opposition repeatedly argued that relative poverty was important and that the conservative party would measure and act on it the government has previously admitted that some families with children might be a year better off out of work as a result of losing their working tax credits following new rules which came into force in april cameron in his scarman lecture in said i believe that poverty is an economic waste and a moral disgrace in the past we used to think of poverty only in absolute terms meaning straightforward material deprivation thats not enough we need to think of poverty in relative terms the fact that some people lack those things which others in society take for granted so i want this message to go out loud and clear the conservative party recognises will measure and will act on relative poverty cpag said that the increase set out in the written answer should be added to the increase in children in relative income poverty by that the institute of fiscal studies ifs found in its analysis of the coalitions welfare cuts the group said this now makes it a total of a million children that the coalitions policies are expected to push into relative income poverty by the ifs analysis included the impact of a fall in poverty due to the introduction of universal

next month marks the th anniversary of the feminine mystique betty friedans hugely influential study that helped to spark that pervasive second wave of feminism that for all its faults and stuttering incompleteness shaped the western world as most of us know it today as a book it was as friedan was herself a flawed advocate of womens rights friedan had little apparent interest in women who were anything other than white and upper middleclass her homophobia became an embarrassment to the womens movement her egotistical paranoia about being ousted as the face of the womens movement was captured with winceinducing brilliance by nora ephron in her essay miami the feminist movement never did and never will run smoothly but friedans book as stephanie coontz writes in her recent book a strange stirring rescued a generation of intelligent women sidelined from the world whatever its flaws the publication of the feminine mystique remains as much of a landmark in the history of feminism as emily davisons death years earlier at the epsom derby and so years on from friedan it pleases me to announce that we have a new face to the modernday feminist movement that face belongs to none other than beyonc knowles last week the new issue of american gq came out and it neatly encapsulated where western feminism is today inside knowles gives an interview that will probably be studied by future generations for lessons in both the loopiness of the stcentury celebrity world and how hilariously far american magazine interviews have fallen since the days of say gay talese and lillian ross in this typical piece of puffery knowles shows off her temperaturecontrolled digital storage facility that contains virtually every photo of her including one video diary entry in which she informs herself that she is going to listen to one of her own songs before having sex with her husband which is one way to get in the mood i guess but there is the gq journalist assures the reader more to knowles than raging narcissism she is a powerful woman with a defiant feminist streak equality is a myth and for some reason everyone accepts that women dont make as much money as men do she rails i truly believe that women should be financially independent from their men and lets face it money gives men the power to run the show it gives men the power to define value they define whats sexy and men define whats feminine its ridiculous knowles is right it is ridiculous that american women earn cents to every dollar earned by men this is almost as ridiculous as say a selfprofessedly powerful female celebrity im more powerful than my mind can even digest announces knowles complaining about men defining sexiness in a mens magazine in which she poses nearly naked in seven photos including one on the cover in which she is wearing a pair of tiny knickers and a mans shirt so cropped that her breasts are visible these photos incidentally were taken by the bafflingly successful american photographer terry richardson a man with a penchant for highly sexualised photos of women and who has been repeatedly accused of sexual exploitation and misconduct by young female models which richardson has denied to complain about the sexualisation of women in mens magazines may seem like complaining about the weather but as knowles rightly says in relation to the pay gap the status quo should not just be shruggingly accepted if it is wrong i never fail to be amazed at the high profile often alist women who celebrate their professional success by posing near naked on the covers of allegedly classy mens magazines such as esquire and gq and these covers are to my eyes becoming increasingly close to porn in the past four months alone weve had cameron diaz bending over in a pair of mesh pants topless mila kunis in leather trousers while inside she writhes naked on a bed rihanna naked save for a mini leather jacket lana del rey also naked except for some jewellery that was on gqs october issue which had four alternative covers that all featured men all of these men funnily enough were clothed its one thing to submit to this attentionseeking nonsense if youre a clist reality tv desperado trying to get on the cover of nuts its another if you are professedly one of the most powerful women in the entertainment business who has no need of such tactics knowles rightly hates the fact that women are humiliated by being paid less than their male counterparts but they are similarly humiliated by being fed the message that it doesnt matter how successful powerful or smart you are all that matters is how sexually available you are willing to make yourself look i should feel happy i guess that knowles is even willing to speak up about equality considering how notoriously few young women in the public eye are willing to identify themselves as feminists that her dworkinish call to arms comes served up with photos of knowles jumping on a bed in a bikini well thats the deal these days apparently in which famous women can sing about independence and girl power as long as theyre wearing next to nothing as i said the feminist movement never did run smoothly but half a

just over a year ago threeyearold thomas hall would not speak he would not play with other children or follow adults instructions now he cant stop chattering at christmas his parents watched with tears in their eyes as their previously ungovernable child stood proudly alongside his classmates dressed as an angel it was says thomass father charles a heartwrenching moment if thomas had carried on along the path he was heading by the time he got to school his behaviour might have become too embedded to change he says i can envisage him being written off as the naughty boy at the back of the classroom charles attributes the change to the work of staff and specialist practitioners at the northend nursery in erith kent a charitable organisation managed by the preschool learning alliance its the sheer amount of skilled oneonone attention hes received thats done it but the nursery didnt just focus on thomas they spent many hours with his mother and me too teaching us what we can do now because our home is a happier calmer place we can start paying proper attention to thomass little brother the nursery hasnt just transformed the life of one little boy its changed the lives of a whole family next week the government is expected to make announcements that could revolutionise childcare everyone agrees it is not before time childcare in the uk is among the most expensive in the world costing an average of of parental income compared with in europe and in sweden despite the expense british childcare fails where it is most needed threequarters of providers are rated by ofsted as good or outstanding but it is children in the poorest areas of the country who receive the worst care according to the sutton trust an educational charity the uk has one of the biggest gaps in school readiness between the richest and poorest four and fiveyearolds based on the top and bottom children from the poorest homes are on average nearly months behind children from the richest homes in vocabulary tests that compares with months in australia and months in canada countries that have similar levels of inequality to the uk but greater social mobility early years providers and experts are waiting on tenterhooks for the announcements there are two pending the government response to professor cathy nutbrowns official review of early education and childcare qualifications in england and the deliberations of david camerons commission on childcare tasked with devising a way to reduce the cost nutbrowns report foundations for quality called for all nursery staff to have alevelstandard professional qualifications and better maths and literacy skills it was widely welcomed by an industry in which of the workforce is educated to graduate level and which struggles to attract and retain highquality workers nutbrown was not asked to price her recommendations and according to figures obtained this week by labour through freedom of information requests finances are moving in the other direction there have been substantial cuts labour discovered to the funding available to train childcare staff figures for local authorities show that money available was slashed by in a year from m in to m in in four areas redcar and cleveland enfield solihull and lewisham there is no money for councils to provide nursery staff training causing more angst are hints dropped this week by the conservative mp elizabeth truss about the conclusions of the childcare commission she has led with steve webb the lib dem pensions minister including possibly changing stafftochildren ratios in childcare settings cutting red tape and creating wraparound care from am to pm as happens in germany talk of changing ratios is controversial under current legislation there is one carer to every three children up to two for toddlers aged two to three and for three to fouryearolds in a piece for the conservativehome website truss wrote we need to think about the balance between the number and quality of staff in our system it is no coincidence that we have the most restrictive adultchild ratios for young children of comparable european countries as well as the lowest staff salaries truss has praised the french coles maternelles system that offers traditional nurserystyle teaching in large groups of three and fouryearolds with each staff member responsible for up to eight toddlers for struggling nurseries being able to reduce staff numbers should be welcome staff salaries account for around of nurseries costs but the reaction from providers has been anything but positive in a survey by the preschool learning alliance of respondents said they did not believe they would be able to maintain their current quality of service if staffing levels were reduced respondents also said having fewer staff would not necessarily reduce the financial burden on parents very few respondents indicated that they would adjust their charges accordingly arguing that the additional revenue would go partway to addressing the historic inadequacy of funding said neil leitch chief executive of the alliance a yettobepublished report by the national childminding association seen by the guardian says almost twothirds of childminders agree that looser ratios would compromise the safety of children in their care a closer look at the foreign systems that truss lauds is revealing according to an independent report from the economist intelligence unit last year the quality of childcare was worse in france than the uk and costs were higher at the northend nursery when asked to imagine the consequences of new staffchild ratios the manager josie lait shakes her head the current ratio makes it hard enough already to give children quality oneonone attention she says around half our children have been referred to us by the health authority which means they have behavioural problems but the other half deserve individual attention too if the ratio is loosened we would find it very hard to give children like thomas the time they need i have to admit that if the ratios are loosened i would be tempted to defy them truss has hinted she wants to deliver money to frontline services currently the government ploughs about bn a year into childcare and early years provision the department for education says the average profit for a nursery is but many are doing far worse with dozens on the brink lait says northend has not made a profit for two years where the money goes is a mystery the government cannot answer its not going on wages nursery staff take home a salary that barely hovers above minimum wage and even a graduate early years professional takes home only half what a qualified teacher does part of the problem is that the cash allocated for free entitlement to hours of childcare for three to fouryearsolds is passed down by central government as part of an overall grant funding all educational functions offered by each local authority within this dedicated schools grant however there is no specific ringfencing for early years provision the result in according to a report by manchester business school the last time this issue was examined was a shortfall of m or of the bn budget between the funding that central government estimated was required by early years providers and the funding that actually reached their coffers on the frontline as local authorities struggle to fund their full educational remit in the teeth of everdeeper funding cuts experts fear early years providers will find themselves receiving an eversmaller slice of the overall pie another reason providers are struggling is that these cuts are being implemented at the same time as local authorities are being asked to do more such as extend free childcare entitlement to all twoyearolds this year in the london borough of bexley early years settings have been told to expect a cut to their funding it seems unlikely that truss will opt for directly funded services as in france at the daycare trust conference she voiced her support for a name and shame approach towards councils im urging local authorities to make sure this funding is passed on to providers she said well be publishing the actual amount every local authority has passed on on the departments website next year so parents and providers will be able to compare rates across the country and hold authorities to account next week probably announcements will be made and the uncertainty will be swept away in kent however it will be too late for yearold katie hawkins the lead practitioner who helped lait set up northend nursery hawkins has a threeyear degree and early years practitioner status she says she has been passionate about working with children since she was a child but now she is leaving i earn half of what my friends earn as teachers even though i have the same levels of qualification as them she says i still live with my parents because i cant afford to move out i dont feel my work is respected or understood my friends and even some parents here just assume we spend our days playing with babies and treat us accordingly she adds its incredibly depressing because i love what i do but i owe it to my future to take a break and take stock i need to find something that pays me a living wage and that i know is respected doing what i do now im never going to be able to move on with my life this article was amended on january the original said part of the problem is that the cash allocated for free entitlement to hours of childcare for three to fouryearsolds is passed by central government down to local authorities without being ringfenced this has been corrected,2013-01,year ago threeyearold thomas hall would speak would play child

the government will fill the gaps in childcare aid by focusing on providing extra help to the working poor and those crucified by high childcare costs nick clegg the deputy prime minister said today he was speaking after a meeting of the quad the four most senior members of the coalition who had agreed on the shape of the childcare package due to be announced in the next week or so there has been an intense dispute over the extent to which the planned help should increase up the income scale the conservatives want the aid to be as broad as possible but clegg denied that it will be seen as regressive in terms of helping the rich he said the aim is first to identify those families that will in future be on universal credit but will not get enough from universal credit to cover their childcare costs and provide an incentive for them to work this is all about giving mothers and fathers an incentive to work and those who are not receiving enough help with their childcare to work secondly consciously and explicitly the aim is to target those working families who dont receive universal credit who are by definition better off than them but who dont feel rich at all and feel crucified by high childcare costs and we need to give them help we are filling gaps with working parents who have been left in the wake of those two or three big progressive steps we have taken with low income working families he said the reforms had to be seen as part of a sequence of initiatives from april to provide hours of free preschool childcare support for twoyearolds starting with the most deprived families julian foster from childcare vouchers association urged the government not to abandon the current voucher system despite criticisms that it helps the middle class most solving

changes introduced on monday have cut child benefit for more than a million households in which one earner is paid more than per year i do not live in one such household my partner and i have cunningly arranged things so that we each earn just under the cut off point ha and once weve outsourced the childcare theres plenty left over all those luxury items that singleearner households on their paltry k can no longer afford only kidding the benefit changes were introduced too fast for us to set up our special screw you traditional families earning arrangement indeed right now were both working fulltime yet have a joint income below that of the singleearner households who will be losing their piece of the benefit pie and with nursery and afterschool club fees coming in every month its hard to pity households on a higher income in which one person can devote themselves fully to the care were paying others to provide i dont mean to sound bitter on the contrary im not i havent just lost my child benefit in a capricious badly thoughtout cut that seems to have been planned on the back of a postage stamp and then doggedly stuck to despite the obvious inconsistencies id be bitter for instance if i were a higherearning single parent who found him or herself penalised in exactly the same way as a couple as it is i think its possible to chop up what various couples could earn between them and find endless ways in which to feel aggrieved and also possible to argue that no one should receive child benefit at all after all its not really in keeping with how wed generally seek to distribute wealth in austerity britain all the same tuesdays telegraph ran the frontpage headline fulltime mothers are being penalised i have to admit for a brief moment this did provoke some oldstyle mummy wars hacklesrising in me a mother who since she doesnt even have the decency to work parttime probably cant even call herself a parttime mother am i therefore a working mother or a skiver mother apparently the benefit cut targets mothers who are doing the right thing unlike me tory mp tim loughton speaks of an army of parents who work hard at home to bring up their children who are losing out on child benefit and other allowances meanwhile writing for the daily mail kathy gyngell refers to the married mother at home penalty and yet its not all that clearcut stayathome mothers whose partners have earnings beneath the threshold wont lose their child benefit still i guess if youre a stayathome mother from a lowerincome family you somehow morph from angel of the hearth into scrounger its the lack of piano lessons that does it there appear to be many on the right who would like to turn the child benefit reform into a socially conservative call to arms certainly useful for ushering in transferable tax breaks for married couples of little benefit where both partners work yet whereas to them whether or not mummy earns appears to be a moral issue overlaid with superficial financial constraints for those of us actually raising children its not so simple it would be easy to say that all stayathome mothers have made a noble sacrifice albeit one which will be ever more difficult to make without incentives whereas working mothers have taken the more selfish option albeit one which they feel forced into by prochildcare policies yet usually theres a mixture of things going on sometimes the cost of childcare means women cant afford to go back to work sometimes the cost of living means they cant afford not to sometimes a return to work doesnt seem financially viable sometimes the job insecurity of one or both partners makes it necessary nonetheless some women have more reason to fear financial dependency and economic isolation than others some women form a better relationship with their children when they also have time away from the home and sometimes we just have to accept that women men and children form thriving family units in different ways unfortunately we havent yet found the political and economic worldview that supports this we dont value the work stayathome mothers do by pretending it is of no economic worth to the individual family unit of course it is thats why plus a stayathome parent goes a lot further than without one all the same if the sacrifice a stayathome mother has to make involves exclusion from meaningful financial independence this seems to me a sacrifice too great it is our tacit acceptance of this that suggests we dont appreciate stayathome mothers and not any changes to child benefit which has never granted mothers the freedom available to some other earners the changes to child benefit are capricious but no more so than the ways in which we reward work beyond the domestic sphere despite a narrative of evergrowing equality the gap between rich and poor is growing the frustration of the middleclass stayathome mother is a mere drop in the ocean compared to broader imbalances but perhaps its symbolic of a need to challenge our whole concept of value if theres a subject youd like to see covered on comment is free please visit our you tell us page,2013-01,change introduced

the rules around child benefit have changed from now on instead of being a universal benefit that all families receive regardless of income it has become meanstested but rather than simply stopping the benefit for families earning more than a certain amount the government has introduced a tax charge all families can still claim and receive child benefit but anyone earning more than a year will be forced to repay some of it in a tax charge anyone earning must repay their entire entitlement not everyone will want to receive the money then repay it through a selfassessment form so the government has allowed people to opt out of getting the cash opting out means missing out on the whole entitlement so you probably wont want to consider it unless you earn or more midnight on january was the deadline for opting out and making sure you dont receive any payments under the new regime but if you missed that deadline dont panic if you do want to opt out rather than going through the hassle of selfassessment it probably isnt too late to do so unless your child benefit payment went into your account today you can probably opt out in time to stop it call hm revenue amp customs on to do so if you have received a payment you can still opt out you can do so at any time however you will need to fill in a selfassessment form in time for january and repay any money you have received if you are already in the selfassessment system missing the deadline will have added minimum hassle you just need to make sure you can afford to repay the benefits you have received there are circumstances in which it makes sense not to opt out if your income is on the border of and you cant be sure you will definitely earn more in this tax year or the next you might be wise to keep hold of it if you have opted out and your circumstances change you can opt back in but if you find at the end of the tax year that you didnt go through the threshold you cannot apply for the money in arrears rather than cancel you could stick it in a savings account each month so it is there when the time comes to pay your tax bill benefits received between april and april will not need to be declared until january and in the meantime they could earn you some although not very much interest the same is true if you think you might see your income fall for any reason perhaps because you are planning to have another child or because your work is looking unstable if you can be disciplined enough to keep the money in a savings account until you need it for the tax bill you might prefer to do that you might also take the view that the system could change with any change of government the labour party has not indicated what it intends to do if it wins the next election but it has said it thinks it is unfair that couples earning each can receive the whole benefit while families with one high earner and one fulltime carer lose it entirely so it might make some changes to the system however charges for the and tax years will be made before the next general election is set to take place so this is not a shortterm strategy we have lots more information on what the changes will mean for different families and answers to some of the questions you might have tell us what youve done did you decide to opt out entirely do you plan to or will you keep receiving the money and pay it

making the argument that the cuts to child benefit which come into force today are unfair will be hard for some to swallow at the moment anyone bringing up a child in the uk can claim per week for the first child and for all subsequent children regardless of income or worth this technically means as newsnight recently pointed out that someone like adele is fully entitled to claim child benefit and that cant be right can it the truth of these cuts though is that they are being unfairly administered and will hit the wrong people in the wrong way im one of the people that will be affected by the child benefit cuts because i earn more than a year i know this might sound like a large salary on its own but that is without context and that is what this argument is missing context im a single mother and i work fulltime meaning that i am reliant on childcare my son has aspergers syndrome and getting him the care he needs is costly little support is available via the nhs in order to achieve that salary i have to live in one of the most expensive areas of the country and therefore pay a significantly high rent buying a house is an unachievable dream that is also all i get there are no rich parents handouts bonuses and certainly no child support from my sons father who has successfully evaded the child support agency for years i appreciate the messages of austerity i hear the claims that we all need to do something but the child benefit cut is not an example of we are all in this together friends of mine who both earn just under the threshold of will keep their full benefit despite the fact that their household income is considerably more than mine i will lose it or some of it its not clear how much until i take part in the added bureaucracy of having to complete selfassessment for tax every year from now on it is easy to criticise the idea of universal benefits and its an argument i think we should be having thats not what i think is wrong here but when you move from a position of a universal benefit to one that is restricted that move has to be done fairly it has to be properly meanstested it has to take into account the reality of the income of a household and not be based on random lines in the sand drawn across a salary scale with the child benefit changes we have managed to do the opposite the threshold is arbitrary the implementation unfair and the application via tax selfassessment at best sloppy and at worst a process that will end up costing the government more than will be gained in the clawback the a month that i received paid for things like school trips and swimming lessons maybe these are luxuries that we should live without but thats not something i really want to have to tell my son im proud of my career im proud of what i have achieved while supporting a child this change will impact us more than you might think the real context is so much more than the headline,2013-01,making argument cut child benefit come

from january families will still be able to receive child benefit but those with at least one partner earning or more will be expected to repay some of the money through a tax charge levied when they fill in a selfassessment tax return the charge is equal to of every earned in excess of which means anyone earning or more will have to repay all of their benefit benefits received in the tax year will need to be declared and the charge paid in january families who do not want to claim the benefit and then have to repay it can contact hmrc to opt out entirely wwwhmrcgovukstopchbpayments or here are some examples of what it means for different families couple living together with two children she claims child benefit and earns he earns this family will be entitled to child benefit worth for their first child and a week for their second child a total of a year however the new tax charge will mean he faces repaying some of that benefit when he fills in his next selfassessment form the

living together with three children she claims child benefit and earns he earns the family can claim child benefit worth a week or a year although she claims the benefit and earns more than the

the intense political debate over the threeyear squeeze on benefits and tax credits is set to intensify as new figures reveal that million women who receive child tax credit directly will be affected a number that includes million working women and more than a million women who care for children while their partners work in addition lowpaid new mothers on a year are losing during pregnancy and the babys first year via cuts to maternity pay pregnancy support and tax credits they are also losing a further from cuts to child benefit over the same period the figures have been compiled by the commons library for the shadow equalities minister yvette cooper and come as mps prepare to vote on tuesday on the threeyear rise in benefits which ends the current link with inflation the vote also comes amid a row about the anomalies thrown up by withdrawing child benefit from higher rate taxpayers hundreds of thousands of people who receive child benefit and who have an individual in the household earning more than annually will have to fill in selfassessment forms if they failed to meet the deadline to notify the hmrc that they should no longer receive child benefit under the new rules david cameron has been battling to create a clear political dividing line with labour seen on the side of the unemployed welfare claimant and the conservatives supporting those striving in work but he was facing headwinds as labour continued to highlight the threeyear squeeze hitting the working poor and the treasury battled to explain the anomalies created by the withdrawal of child benefit the figures compiled for cooper show that twothirds of those affected overall by the benefit and tax credit freeze are women on average of those hit by mondays child benefit change are women including women on low pay or at home with small children with partners earning more than a year cooper said once again women are bearing the brunt of david camerons damaging policies and paying the price for this governments economic failure george osborne and david cameron came up with real cuts to tax credits as a political stunt whilst giving millionaires a tax cut the shocking truth is that working women are paying the price of these tory boys political games twothirds of those hit directly by the strivers tax are women including over million working mums who are losing out from changes to the child tax credit time and again david cameron reveals he has a complete blind spot about womens lives either he hasnt a clue or he just doesnt care this cabinets deep prejudice against women means working women and mums at home with young children have been hardest hit every time cameron in an interview on the bbcs andrew marr programme did not deny many of those affected by the rise in benefits and tax credits were in work but said the labour party agrees with the increase for public sector pay but doesnt agree with the cap on welfare the prime minister struggled to defend the withdrawal of child benefit which was described by the rightwing thinktank the institute of economic affairs as probably the single most incompetent change to the benefits system since the second world war the changes will mean that families with one parent earning more than will lose part of their child benefit the benefit is fully withdrawn where one parent earns above even though two couples earning a year with a joint income of are unaffected defending the policy cameron said im not saying those people are rich but i think it is right that they make a contribution this will raise bn a year if we dont raise that bn from that group of people the better off in the country we would have to find someone else to take it from he said the only way to have avoided the anomalies would be to have a system that means tested every family in the country i dont want to introduce that sort of complexity into our system and that is why we opted for the relatively straightforward approach but ed balls the shadow chancellor denounced the plan as a complete shambles adding were going to have many many hundreds of thousands of people who will end up filing in tax returns because they

less than a fifth of the million families who will lose all their child benefit under reforms coming in on monday have so far opted out of receiving the payment around households have given up their right to child benefit ahead of the changes that critics have warned will cause administrative chaos and exacerbate family breakdown lin homer head of hm revenue and customs hmrc said twice as many families as expected had already opted out of receiving the payment and claimed administration costs were lower than estimated but the figure is just a sixth of the million families who will be affected by the reforms of whom million will lose all their child benefit the benefit is currently paid at the rate of a week for the first child and then a week for each child after that it lasts until each child reaches or if they are still in fulltime education and in some cases until they are under the new system families where one parent earns between and will see their benefit progressively reduced based on income and households where one person earns more than will lose the benefit altogether people who do not give up their entitlement will have to declare it in a selfassessed tax return even if they currently do not file one homer admitted that hmrc had still not contacted of those affected asked if hmrc would pursue families that did not register that they were above the threshold she said we are going to talk to those people and thats what we have been doing since this autumn the treasury said of the population would continue to receive child benefit as they do now while would still receive some of the benefit christian guy managing director of the centre for social justice thinktank said the child benefit changes would put more pressure on families uk family breakdown is spiralling out of control the chaotic child benefit reforms being introduced on monday risk pouring further fuel on the fire the new rules will mean that married couples where one earns over pa will be unable to avoid losing some or all of their child benefit meanwhile similar couples who are cohabiting will face unenviable choices a severe financial penalty if they marry or breaking the law if they deny their relationship status this creates a potential marriage penalty despite evidence showing how crucial marriage is to stable families and children research illustrates that breakup rates are three times higher for couples who cohabit compared with those who marry under the reforms households where one parent earns more than a year will have to return the entire amount of child benefit through the selfassessment system unless they have opted out of receiving it in the first place it will be taken away on a sliding scale where mothers or fathers earn between and the reform is highly controversial especially as families where both parents earn just under each will keep their full benefits,2013-01,less fifth million family lose child

i represent kids a charity providing an adventure play service for disabled children and young people in february thames water presented a revised bill to the charity for for water consumption between february and february looking at our historical and current usage this is nowhere near what we should be paying the meter is not on our premises which are surrounded by a high fence and locked gate but on common ground outside we registered an appeal when this bill was presented on february thames water has been out to read our meter we have kept regular readings and reviewed this against historical usage thames water representatives have verbally agreed that our recorded usage historically and currently does not show kids using the amount of water to justify the this bill we have supplied endless information about other building work around the area that may have had access to this water supply meter readings and so on we have also made numerous phone calls sent emails to try to resolve this issue kids is constantly told that thames water will send someone out to read the meters but we are still awaiting an outcome and a formal outcome to our appeal we are coming up to a year with no resolution in sight the implication of not resolving this for the charity is that it had to continue to hold this bill as a liability meaning it has serious financial implications i would welcome your support in resolving this issue once and for all wk london how could this bill ever have been correct thames water even acknowledged to you that a water bill times the size of your normal annual bill was not right yet failed to do anything about it for an entire year after you appealed after we contacted thames water it said there was a suspected underground leak on your supply pipe possibly caused by nearby building work which led to the large increase due to the sudden spike in water going through the meter it is not clear why it could not have identified this earlier it took it just a couple of days to discover it once we contacted them it initially said it was adjusting your bill back down based on the average daily consumption before this uncharacteristic spike so it dropped the bill from to around saving your charity approximately a spokesman for thames water also said that it would make a donation to your charity and would be in touch with you about this some time later it hadnt contacted you so we contacted it to ask it to get its act together it is good that we did as it decided to cancel the entire bill of and pay your charity a donation we welcome

nearly families are to face a marginal income tax rate of more than as a consequence of child benefit being withdrawn from individuals earning in excess of the institute of fiscal studies has suggested from january families will still be able to receive child benefit but those with one or more partners earning or more will be expected to repay some of the money through a tax charge levied when tax returns are completed the ifs warns that the reforms will create administrative complexities and bring incoherence to the welfare system by providing some child support on the basis of individual income and other funds on the basis of household income the changes to child benefit will save the government an estimated bn in child benefit is being withdrawn on a tapered basis starting at the income level with individuals earning or more getting nothing the rate of withdrawal is linked to the number of children in receipt of benefit the ifs says the marginal tax rate for those earning is increased by about percentage points for the first child and by an additional seven percentage points for each subsequent one so for example while about people will find that their marginal income tax rate increases to more than about of them those with three or more children will find that it jumps to at least the economic thinktank also says the government has introduced a contradictory parallel structure of child support with child benefit taxed on the basis of individual incomes and the child credit element of universal credit being based on household income it warns we already have the child tax credit and soon its imminent replacement namely the child additions within universal credit the reform to child benefit will mean that we have two systems of incomerelated support for children but the relationship to income will be completely different in each case based on family income in one and the earnings of the highestincome family member in the other withdrawn at different rates as income rises and the withdrawal starting at very different income levels it adds that as the government introduces a means test via universal credit ministers are introducing a new and separate means test for child benefit which will work in a completely different way as well as making the seventh existing meanstested benefit council tax benefit much more complicated by asking every local authority in england to design its own scheme it is unclear whether the net effect of all this will be to improve the welfare system the ifs also warns of administrative complexities including the need for up to more individuals to fill in selfassessment income tax forms according to hmrc overall the reforms will affect about families in which at least one adult has a taxable income exceeding a year who stand to lose all child benefit a further families in which the highest earning adult has would have some child benefit clawed back the remaining of families would be unaffected for now the ifs also makes the now familiar critique that the government plans create anomalies since a twoearner couple with taxable income of split equally would retain all child benefit but a singleearner couple or lone parent with taxable income of would lose all of it it claims the reform will push individuals to reduce their taxable income by for example working less or contributing more to a private pension chris leslie the shadow treasury minister said the ifs analysis highlighted the massive complexity of this unfair policy he added following the news this week that thousands of parents affected may not even be aware of the changes its becoming increasingly clear that david cameron and george osborne failed to think through how this policy would work in practice as well as being an administrative nightmare these changes are also unfair how can it be right that singleearner families on will have their child benefit cut while some couples earning as much as keep all of theirs and people earning over get a tax cut in april the treasury said the ifs proposed abolishing child benefit completely and subsuming it into the tax credit system we disagreed with this approachunder our proposals of the population will continue to receive child benefit as they do now ninety per cent will continue to gain from child benefit looking at marginal rates in this way is misleading as the charge simply withdraws some or all of the money that has been paid in child benefit no one will be taxed more than the benefit they receive withdrawing child benefit on the basis of the combined family income would require intrusive meanstesting of all eight million households getting child benefit the way we are doing it is simpler for the vast majority of families and significantly removes the potential cliff edge effect of the change,2013-01,nearly family face marginal income tax rate consequence child benefit withdrawn individual earning excess institute fiscal study ha suggested january family still able receive child benefit one partner earning expected repay money tax charge levied tax return completed ifs warns reform create administrative complexity bring incoherence welfare system providing child support basis individual income fund basis household income change child benefit save government estimated bn child benefit withdrawn tapered basis starting income level individual earning getting nothing rate withdrawal linked number child receipt benefit ifs say marginal tax rate earning increased percentage point first child additional seven percentage point subsequent one example people find marginal income tax rate increase three child find jump least economic thinktank also say government ha introduced

what is happening the government has changed the child benefit system so that instead of being a universal benefit paid to all families regardless of how much they earn it will be meantested from monday january any household in which someone earns more than will no longer be entitled to the full payment households which include someone earning more than will not be entitled to any child benefit at all however rather than just paying parents less the government will continue to pay the full amount and claw back overpayments through the tax system and a new high income child benefit charge unless you opt not to receive the payments to opt out before the new regime begins you have to do so by midnight on january you can do this online at wwwhmrcgovukstopchbpayments or by calling how will that work anyone who is affected by the change will need to fill in a selfassessment tax return the first one will need to be filed on january and will cover any payments received between january and the end of the tax year april for payments received in the tax year you will need to fill in a selfassessment form by january the tax charge has been set so the more you earn in excess of the more you need to pay back it is set at of the amount of child benefit for each of income you receive beyond if for example you earn you will need to repay of the benefit you have received over the tax year of the you will receive for your first child once you reach earnings of the tax charge is equal to the entire child benefit payment how much is child benefit worth the current rate of child benefit is a week for the oldest child and a week for each subsequent child the payments are made every four weeks into one parents bank account how much will people typically have to pay back hmrc has said about million families will be affected of who will lose all of their child benefit the average loss will be roughly a year a considerable chunk of the annual paid to a family with two children i earn less than but my partner earns what now if your partner is a spouse someone you are in a civil partnership with or someone you are living with as if you were married or civil partners he or she will need to pay the high income child benefit charge hmrc may have written to confirm this but even if no letter has been received the charge still stands there is a calculator on the hmrc website where you can work out how much will need to be repaid you will continue to receive the whole payment every four weeks unless you decide to opt out entirely and lose the whole benefit it is the recipient who has to stop the payment not the high earner if your partner does not live with you and has not done so during this tax year their income will not have an impact i earn less than but my partner earns what now as in the above example you need to be living with your partner for his or her income to have an impact on your entitlement you will still receive the full benefit every four weeks but your partner will face a tax charge for the entire amount when selfassessment time arrives some families will decide that it is easier to opt out of receiving the payment than to take it and pay it all back it is the recipient who has to stop the payment not the high earner if i cancel will i have future problems claiming my state pension claiming child benefit earns you national insurance credits which can ensure you are still entitled to a full state pension hmrc says that if you are currently receiving child benefit and opt out you will still get the credits if you do not have a child now but do later on and earn more than or have a partner that does so you will be able to protect your ni contributions by filling in the application form for child benefit but indicating that you want to opt out of receiving it slightly confusing but it should protect your pension no one in my family earns more than will we still get it you will still be entitled to receive the full amount of child benefit if you get a pay rise during the year you will need to notify hmrc unless your earnings add up to more than during the tax year you will not face the charge until what if i miss the january deadline to opt out do not panic for a start it only applies if you or your partner are earning more than otherwise you will probably want to receive the benefit and keep hold of the portion to which you are still entitled if you do stand to repay the whole lot through selfassessment cancelling a few days late means you will only face a small repayment next year and hmrc has suggested there may be some flexibility for people who call in the few days after the deadline to opt out is there any way i can avoid losing my child benefit yes the income that is taken into account by hmrc is a persons adjusted net income that is the income after company pension contributions and charitable donations and after money is taken out through any salary sacrifice schemes like childcare vouchers and buying extra holiday you could reduce your income and how much tax you have to pay through any of these schemes there are more details and a fierce debate about the ethics

almost a third of families who will be affected by changes to the child benefit system that come into force on monday have not received notification from the taxman it has emerged from january child benefit will be meanstested and payments will be clawed back in households where one partner earns at least hmrc has said about million families will be affected of who will lose all of their child benefit the average loss will be roughly a year a considerable chunk of the annual paid to a family with two children it said it would be writing to affected families in autumn but it has emerged that only households have been contacted leaving at least who could be unaware of the changes hmrc said it had been unable to contact everyone as it held incomplete data on some customers following changes to their income relationship status or address a hmrc spokesman said there may be cases where peoples circumstances have changed for example their income may have increased or address may have changed and we will not yet have uptodate information however to ensure people know about the changes we are also using extensive advertising media and online activity as well as written communication our target audience will have seen the adverts five times on average and there has been extensive media coverage of the change over million hits on the guidance section of the hmrc website and uses of our online calculator show that the message is getting through when the rules come into force a family receiving the benefit with at least one high earner can continue to receive payments worth a week for the oldest child and a week for each subsequent child but will have some of the money taken back as a tax charge the high income child benefit charge hicbc will kick in when someones taxable income is at least and will be of the amount of child benefit for each of income between and those earning or more will face a charge equal to the total annual amount of child benefit so will effectively receive nothing the money will be taken through the selfassessment regime and will be paid when tax is collected for the financial year in which it is received payments between january and the end of the tax year will be collected in january while those for the tax year will be taken in january families who stand to lose the whole benefit can opt to cancel payments rather than receiving them and repaying them as tax as of january people had chosen to do this with the deadline for doing so set at midnight on january to complicate matters the cancellation has to be done by the recipient whether or not they are the high earner but where letters have been sent out they have been sent to the high earner child benefit was fist offered in as family allowances and has been a universal benefit but in the government announced it would cut it for highrate taxpayers this decision was watered down so the benefit was tapered on earnings in excess of but it remains controversial in part because it is possible for a couple earning between them to keep their full benefit while a household with one earner who takes home loses some of theirs the labour party has criticised the treasury for not informing all of those families who will be affected catherine mckinnell shadow exchequer secretary to the treasury said david cameron and george osborne have failed to think through this policy or how it will work in practice there could be a nasty surprise in store for thousands of parents if they are not aware of the changes and have to pay back thousands of pounds in child benefit at the end of the year she added this policy not only risks being a costly administrative nightmare its also unfair its totally perverse that singleearner families on will see their child benefit cut while some couples earning as much as keep all of theirs and those on over get a big tax cut this year if you receive child benefit and want to opt out you can do so at wwwhmrcgovukstopchbpayments or call it is possible to opt out at any point after the deadline but you will pay a tax charge on any payments you have received hmrc is holding a live twitter qampa on january between am and am using the hashtag

were going to change the way we talk about domestic violence for some reasons that are good and some that are depressing from march the official definition of domestic violence will be widened to include teenagers who are being abused in a relationship and also to include coercive control on that second point it is worth underlining how abuse might not necessarily be violence or the violence itself might be accompanied by other abuses that make the whole situation harder to escape pat cravens freedom programme a part cbtpart group therapy course for victims documents some chilling tactics that violent partners use such as keeping the victim permanently pregnant or in charge of a newborn when i went to see a course in newcastle one woman described how some time after she had left her husband and found a house for herself and her children her ex would steal in five minutes before they left for school and take one of the kids shoes leaving the family in permanent fear and also always late for school clearly there is so much more to this than flesh wounds the change in the law will generate some discussion presumably as thinkers in the richard littlejohn cast wrap their minds around the idea that psychological abuse has more to it than telling someone she looks fat on that first change it seems bizarre now that anybody would not count a teenager as the victim of domestic abuse and yet it took a home office consultation that ran from to to reach this conclusion i suppose the logic is that if they still live at their parental home and not with their partner its not technically domestic i suspect however that the real reason is that domestic abuse is codified to make it seem rarer or more distant from the mainstream than it is in this case straightforwardly by not counting properly elsewhere im still struck by how often it is romanticised especially in murder cases and even more noticeably in murdersuicides when norfolk councillor keith johnson shot his wife andrea dead in december news reports described police trying to fathom what had gone so tragically wrong often a report will detail the offence that led to the victims death she was having an affair or she wanted to leave i dont think this is intended to blame the victim though ive heard that argued but i do think its an attempt to place the violence within a narrative of romance almost to take the sting out of it you would never see the motive get such prominent billing in an account of one teenager stabbing another the murderer believed the victim to have stolen his phone where it is not romanticised its often ascribed to ethnicity the obvious example being the honour killing once its a cultural problem that brings statutory relativism women from some communities are simply not thought to warrant the interventions that would be made if they were white and british then when the woman is killed her community is deemed cold and strange cultural differences again are blamed for the escalation from abuse to murder when in fact it was the perception of difference that left the victim unsupported not the difference itself but this is changing too jagonari a womens educational centre in londons east end has launched a campaign against domestic violence in tower hamlets where theres a very high incidence of abuse domestic incidents recorded last year it has the precise intention of reaching the communities that are neglected by mainstream agencies in the name of sensitivity working with the interfaith forum and the london muslim centre i would expect this to be copied across the country when its results start to show crime prevention teams are very keen on new approaches to domestic violence for human reasons and also because it is so expensive the solutions and the sanctions might be getting more imaginative but the problem itself is getting worse or where its not worse its certainly no better home office data released last november showed that of calls to the police were about domestic violence which rose to in merseyside in scotland a increase in cases in rising to in led police to make domestic violence their christmas campaign in ireland the number of women and children seeking refuge went up by to of those were turned away because funding streams have dried up in this country local authorities are struggling with provision although at the moment the gaps are being plugged by fundraising or charities spending from their legacies many domestic violence groups and campaigners are trenchant about not linking recession to abuse sandra horley chief executive of refuge says domestic violence has been going on for centuries irrespective of the economic climate factors such as poverty and unemployment may exacerbate the violence but they do not cause it domestic violence is an abuse of power men abuse women because they get away with it as a society we tolerate it and therefore indirectly condone it but domestic violence in england is also rising again having been falling pretty steadily since a spike in the early s also a time of recession it seems pretty clear considering all the other things that rise with inequality drug and alcohol abuse mental health problems that a really bleak economic outlook makes this problem worse i think you can say that without exculpating the violent individuals it is instructive to look at the british crime survey because things were significantly worse in the s attitudes have changed the conviction rate has got much better at it is astonishing next to the rate for rape and numbers are down in the long term but certain women for reasons of age or race have been shamefully underserved by the law and by society hopefully thats about to change,2013-01,going change way talk

knock knock whos there a postmenopausal differently abled nonwhite ciswoman feminism doesnt always tend to lend itself to comedy and yet while political satire and alternative comedy have a rich and radical history there seems to be an emerging critique of combining fun with feminism apparently some of us are hampering the destruction of the patriarchy with fanny jokes ellie mae ohagan recently made an impassioned defence of anger in political movements and the motivating force that it has given historically and today to the feminist movement but she warns against watering this anger down to make it more palatable to a broader audience by making it funny and sexy as ohagan says sexy funny feminism is inspired by the fear that feminism will never get anywhere unless it is likable and that by trying to please everyone means that you inevitably achieve nothing while i entirely agree that social movements need to be radical and challenge the status quo otherwise they are not movements just society to imply that humour undermines a feminist political position or is a mechanism to get people to like you underestimates the power of comedy satire and knob gags there is a conflation of a few issues here the feeling that some feminists are appeasing men or the patriarchy by trying to be liked that feminists who are funny are not being truly political and a false dichotomy between humour and anger in her criticism of fun feminism julie bindel is more targeting the tactics and analysis of some within the feminist movement today those who are slutwalking producing porn or taking lapdancing classes rather than necessarily those who are using humour to puncture injustice indeed as most female comedians will tell you humour is not necessarily a way to get people to like you especially men the hilarious and trailblazing joan rivers said in an interview with dawn french men dont want you too funny theyre terrified that you might be smarter than they are brighter than they are cleverer than they are wittier no i think a man has to be terribly secure funny women are often not felt to be conventionally attractive and if there is one thing that women are told to be it is conventionally attractive to be funny is to be a smartarse to be clever quick and able to take down the bully in the playground or the millionaire in the cabinet this doesnt usually mean you are going to be liked by the target of your humour the politician you satirise or the exboyfriend you emasculate rather than appeasing the powerful comedy in the right hands should destroy them at least for the length of a set to consider feminists who are funny as not truly political is to yet again hold women to different standards than men has anyone ever said that mark thomas or mark steele are not political enough because they are comedians the comedy writer john ofarrell is currently standing as a labour candidate in eastleigh and comedianturnedpolitician beppe grillo could form the official opposition in italys parliament being funny is part of their politics and vice versa comedians are imprisoned in burma cartoonists are arrested for sedition in india and islamists in tunisia try and fail to stop students performing and filming a harlem shake all because in the right hands comedy can be dynamite under the oppressive backsides of authoritarian groups or regimes who by definition have absolutely no sense of humour it is a totally false dichotomy to pit anger against humour in suzanne moores excellent essay on female anger she chides us because we cloak our vitriol in humour but people are often funny because they are angry their comedy amplifies and funnels their anger the vitriol of lenny bruce bill hicks richard pryor chris rock and doug stanhope is certainly not cloaked by their humour but instead it delivers them sellout audiences drawn to their bile while it is entirely legitimate to have a go if someone finds lap dancing to be the height of empowerment or believes that emily wilding davison died for our right to vajazzle to criticise a feminist for being too funny too often is to ignore the power of comedy a power that men have been politically wielding for centuries though clearly not in the house of commons humour is antiestablishment it is powerful and it is insightful it wont in and of itself end racial segregation or topple a government but it is a heavily armoured vehicle in your culture war but if any movement needs a satirist its definitely feminism at least well have a laugh while we construct the matriarchal utopia,2013-02,knock

christian feminists have a bit of a visibility issue i first thought this at a go feminist conference where i facilitated discussion in a session entitled faith and feminism one woman taking part was astounded and excited by the fact that a friend of mine who happens to be a vicar was attending she had never come across a feminist vicar before then there was the blog post about feminism and religion that led to commenters positing the idea that christian feminists and feminists who belong to other religions too are brainwashed pointlessly subscribing to patriarchal and misogynist belief systems that we need to reject entirely if we ever want to see true gender equality these accusations of stockholm syndrome are common yet what is often missed is that religion itself is not inherently misogynist antiwoman teachings and practices have often been the result of societal and cultural influences rather than christian teaching itself which often gave women more respect and power than grecoroman society allowed it is in the new testament that we read of jesus a product of a deeply patriarchal society showing compassion towards a woman accused of adultery and healing a woman who would have been considered unclean women were not accepted as witnesses in jewish law yet it was a woman who was the first to report her discovery of the empty tomb and jesuss resurrection because he told her to and at a time when women did not learn about theology jesus encouraged it it was the discussion of this among other things that led a collective of five women including myself to set up a ukbased christian feminist network our goals to provide community and learning opportunities for likeminded people to liaise with the secular feminist movement and raise awareness of our concerns and to support existing feminist campaigns as well as engaging with churches and christian organisations on gender issues encouraging them to take action the aim of the christian feminist network is to move beyond a focus on the usual issues that can become a sticking point whenever people discuss women and christianity women bishops women in leadership and the role of women in the church and family in general it may have seemed timely that the launch happened not long after the disappointment of the vote on women bishops but theres no point simply replicating the work of existing prowomenbishops organisations that are already doing excellent work such as watch when the network launched at an event at southwark cathedral last month attendees were incredibly positive about what they described as a group that has been a long time coming some were retired and had long been members of other christian womens groups others were young women excited to finally feel able to discuss issues they care about everyone was keen to create an atmosphere of friendship and support our followup email discussing the success of the launch went out to almost people the power of the internet has been instrumental in setting up the network blogs and social media have over the past couple of years brought many christian feminists together and inspired plenty of discussions and projects it would be ridiculous to ignore some of the things the church has put women through over the years whether were talking about viewing women as the reason everything went downhill in the first place or modernday movements that eschew birth control and teach that women should never attend university or work outside the home all this is as far as christian feminists are concerned exactly why prowoman movements within christianity are important meetings and activism will reflect the interests and expertise of all members from theology and relationships to race and violence against women the network is keen to engage with feminists of all faiths and none there are plans to hold future gettogethers in different locations in order to avoid a bias towards those located in london this month many christian bloggers have been exploring the churchs attitudes towards sex relationships and gender it has become clearer than ever that for girls and women this often means double standards shame and unrealistic expectations people will of course be quick to say why dont you just leave the church but gender inequality wasnt part of the message of jesus and its time to

a man accused of rape was allowed to walk free and later kill two children as a result of a disturbing police policy to manipulate crime statistics by failing to record sexual assault allegations a tactic that was employed in several more london boroughs than was officially admitted on tuesday the guardian has learned an official report from the independent police complaints commission on tuesday identified one london borough southwark where the policy operated however sources said that an internal police review in had identified five other areas where similar practices operated the resulting policy led to scores of women in boroughs such as haringey having their allegations not classed as crimes instead of being investigated by police when the practices were spotted by metropolitan police chiefs and corrected it led to a spike in recorded sexual offences in a year a rise of recorded incidents a source said tuesdays report from the ipcc focused on the policy of a specialist met sex crimes unit based in southwark south london which was branded as deeply disturbing the ipcc said the sapphire unit in southwark tried to persuade women who reported they had been sexually attacked to drop their cases it did so to boost its performance figures which were among the worst in the met the policy had disastrous consequences a woman who made rape allegations against jean say in november did not have her case investigated say went on to murder his daughter regina aged and son rolls aged with a carving knife with police having missed the chance to take him off the streets he was later jailed for life the ipcc report says a detective decided that the woman who earlier made rape allegations against say had consented to sex thus no forensics were taken and the suspect was not even interviewed about the rape allegation according to the report there is no doubt from the evidence that the woman made an allegation of rape at walworth police station which should have been believed and thoroughly investigated the ipcc also revealed other met failings it said that officers involved in alleged blunders which left the serial sex attacker kirk reid free to assault an estimated women had not faced a disciplinary panel despite the watchdog saying they should answer charges of gross misconduct furthermore two officers who should have faced discipline hearings were in fact promoted a protest letter from the ipcc deputy chair deborah glass to the met complaining about a unhappy litany of delay and prevarication in the failure to hold discipline hearings did not receive a reply the watchdog added the report was the ipccs ninth into the mets treatment of sexual violence victims glass warned that the mets repeated claims to have learned lessons after a series of blunders was hard to find credible given the number of cases where the mets response to victims has failed either through individual officers criminality or neglect or more systemic problems of training priorities and resources the response that lessons have been learned begins to ring hollow she said the met said the scandal in southwark has been ended it ran from to women reporting sexual assaults would be questioned repeatedly by a detective about whether they had consented to sex they were encouraged to withdraw their complaints which boosted the units sanctioned detection rate the sapphire units behaviour broke the forces policy that women were to be believed unless there was compelling evidence to the contrary the ipcc refused to say how many women had been affected by the practice it said further investigation was hampered because of missing files which disappeared during building works and due to an archiving system but solicitor debaleena dasgupta who helps women who feel they have been failed by the criminal justice system said the refusal to investigate legitimate rape claims was widerreaching than one sapphire unit i have been approached by people who have been in the same position when dealt with by other parts of the met its not just southwark she said the revelations about southwark are the latest in a long line of police blunders in dealing with sexual violence cases in the case of john worboys the met police missed chances to stop a man who drugged raped and sexually assaulted over women he was arrested and released after a woman came forward in july and officers chose to believe his account not hers the victim said she had been lied to and laughed at by officers worboys was given an indeterminate sentence in april a detective from another sapphire unit was convicted last year of failing to investigate the alleged rapes and sexual assaults of women by faking police reports failing to pass on forensic evidence and not interviewing suspects green party london assembly member jenny jones said the met was failing to honour repeated promises to end blunders in rape and sexual assault cases despite the fine words of four commissioners in the past years the met is still underperforming badly for rape survivors and simply not doing their job of solving crimes and catching criminals in a statement the met said it had improved we have for some time acknowledged that previous investigation of rape and serious sexual assault in the mps was below standard the activities identified in this report came during that era and highlight specific issues within southwark which resulted in unacceptable actions by local officers it is as a result of such failings that we have made substantial changes to the investigation of rape and serious sexual assault both in terms of structure and revised working practices the ipcc said discipline cases may be held against met officers and at least one from another unit is facing a

this month i decided that after over years of waxing lyrical about feminism it was about time i read some theory and so i bought a copy of betty friedans seminal tome the feminine mystique which was published years ago this week feminine mystique is the name friedan coined for the impossibly perfect vision of the s american woman domestic goddess devoted mother available lover faithful wife the book angrily charts the lie that friedan and her contemporaries were sold that the battle for gender equality had been won and all that remained was for women to enjoy the freedom of housewifery the only thing that could ever fulfil them friedan repeatedly alludes to the problem without a name the term she uses for the malaise felt by the women experiencing this oppression and being told it was happiness there are some valid criticisms of the feminine mystique like the fact that friedan only refers to working class women when suggesting they could act as nannies to alleviate the ennui of middleclass housewives but its still a pivotal and revolutionary work when i read it i could almost see those women looking down at their wrists and seeing chains materialise chains that had previously been invisible to them the new york times this week carries several letters from elderly women to whom reading friedans work was a lifechanging experience to my mind the most amazing and miserable aspect of the feminine mystique is how relevant it still is women of my generation are still being sold lies to keep us obedient we are told that we are valued until we accuse a revered man of rape we are told we are equal and yet we still do most of the lowpaid and unpaid work we are told we are respected and yet we are harassed in the street objectified and ridiculed in the media and haunted by words like nag harridan and hysteric in our personal relationships like friedans our feminism is stifled by the belief that the battles have been won and we are free to enjoy equality in all of its malesanctioned glory there are the flickers of a revival of feminism slut walks projects about harassment and media objectification and feminist summer schools all suggest a new generation of women fighting the lies that they are being sold but at the same time the poledancing oneofthelads brand of feminism which was such an utter failure in the s seems to be reemerging in a different form perhaps then contemporary feminism is at a crossroads for every feminist summer school we have caitlin morans swashbuckling blokey feminism which seems to be about making lots of witty observations about sexism without ever putting them in the context of social oppression for every campaign against objectification we have the sex and the city brand of feminism as personified by a burgeoning movement in america calling itself sexy feminists which reassures us that one can believe in gender equality and still pay hefty sums of money to have pubic hair ripped out at the root in my mind if being sexy and funny are the two cornerstones of a new feminist movement we may as well all pack up and go home now at its core feminism should be angry it should be angry because women are still being taken for a ride like the women in the feminine mystique we are being sold a lie of equality in a society where the odds are politically socially and economically stacked against us feminisms most basic function should be to emphasise that sexism is not an accident but an inevitable consequence of a society structured to favour men jokes about vaginas and reassurances that we wont have to give up lipstick are not enough to put it bluntly a new feminism should not be afraid to piss people off sexy funny feminism is inspired by the fear that feminism will never get anywhere unless it is likeable for a long time now feminists have been told that their message will never spread to the masses if the messenger appears to be an angry manhating lesbian shouting the odds from a gender studies seminar room but we need to realise that popular nonthreatening feminism is destined for failure as well in a patriarchy and if you are a feminist you accept that we are living in one what is popular and nonthreatening is what men deem to be acceptable when feminists decide they want to appeal to everybody what they are really doing is attempting to appeal to men as culture in a patriarchy is defined by male values and male norms feminism that prioritises popularity over its own integrity will necessarily fail as it is bound to reproduce the very problems it is fighting against perhaps morans recent observations that women who wear high heels are inviting rape are testament to this friedan changed feminism because she wrote a book that spoke to womens hearts and souls and wasnt afraid of offending men in the process an yearold woman wrote in the new york times this week that the feminine mystique had made her realise that she was not a freak for feeling a sense of malaise women today are becoming angry at being made to feel like freaks for feeling malaise at being catcalled objectified and shamed the goal of feminists must be to harness that anger to create something better not stifle it with a feminism which pleases everybody but changes nothing,2013-02,month decided year waxing lyrical feminism wa time read theory bought copy betty friedan

police from a heavily criticised sex crime unit pressured a woman to drop a rape claim against a man who went on to murder his two children an official report has said jean say killed his son and daughter two years ago when they went to stay with him for a weekend the earlier rape allegation against him was dismissed by a detective sergeant based in the sapphire unit at southwark south london who said the circumstances did not constitute rape because the woman consented a report by the independent police complaints commission said there is no doubt from the evidence that the woman made an allegation of rape at walworth police station which should have been believed and thoroughly investigated rape victims were pressured to withdraw their allegations by a specialist metropolitan police unit as officers tried to gerrymander their performance statistics the report found the independent police complaints commission ipcc said the sapphire unit at southwark had failed victims women reporting rapes and sexual assaults were encouraged to withdraw their allegations it said the watchdog said its investigation followed cases in when the southwark sapphire unit was performing poorly and under pressure to improve the report found women were questioned repeatedly by a detective about whether they had consented to sex they were encouraged to withdraw their complaints which boosted the units sanctioned detection rate the rape allegations were not recorded by police the ipcc deputy chair deborah glass said the units approach was wholly inappropriate and deeply disturbing the ipcc said the unit had improved since coming under centralised command in the metropolitan police said in a statement we have for some time acknowledged that previous investigation of rape and serious sexual assault in the mps was below standard the activities identified in this report came during that era and highlight specific issues within southwark which resulted in unacceptable actions by local officers it is as a result of such failings that we have made substantial changes to the investigation of rape and serious sexual assault both in terms of structure and revised working practices the statement said in sapphire was moved to specialist crime and operations to increase the focus on victim care and improve investigation standards this has led to increased supervision and the met being much better placed to identify any wrongdoing and refer it to the ipcc the number of prosecutions has increased by and victim care has improved significantly we are not complacent and know there is always more that can be done to improve our service to victims that is why we continue to work closely with key partners including the cps the havens and charities such as rape crisis there is also more focused engagement with external scrutiny bodies ensuring the mps learns lessons and continues to improve performance and public confidence,2013-02,police heavily criticised sex crime unit

many women at westminster mps aides ministers lobbyists and journalists complain of encountering neanderthal behaviour among prominent parliamentarians one cabinet minister in the last labour government chased a woman round a sofa in his office in an unsuccessful attempt to kiss her a married peer has a habit of chatting to young women in the hotel bar during his partys annual conference he will then announce that he is going up to his room and will invite the woman to join him after a suitable interlude another parliamentarian opens lunches with women by commenting in some detail on their clothing he has a habit of leering at his lunch guests as he comments on their clothes one mp asked a young woman whether she was working at westminster to get a sexual thrill one woman who has experienced sexism at westminster said that men who behave inappropriately were not guilty of innocent mistakes it is power they know they have embarrassed you when they make a sordid lurch and try to kiss you women journalists can scream at these dreadful men but it is much more difficult for women hoping to become mps who work for the parties campaigners say the anecdotes of sexual harassment build a picture of a britain still governed according to antiquated rules in westminster as the allegations about the lib dem lord rennard focused attention on sexism at westminster the fawcett society which campaigns for womens rights accused parliament of failing to act on a groundbreaking report into increasing representation at westminster among women and minority groups for too long parliament has operated according to antiquated rules that go against the grain of modern life the fawcett society chief executive ceri goddard said adding that mps should implement the seminal speakers conference report of goddard added its parliament urgently needs to get up to date that means a house of commons that looks a lot more like the rest of the country and a political culture where parents and others with responsibilities outside of westminster dont find themselves excluded from the political system the seminal speakers conference report had cross party support and looked at why british politics isnt more reflective of wider society and called on parties to clarify their policies on parental leave do far more to encourage those outside of the usual suspects to get involved and generally work together to ensure parliament is more in tune with modern st century working practices and attitudes rennard gave evidence to the speakers conference committee on april a month before he stood down as the partys chief executive after allegations about his behaviour had been brought to the attention of the leadership rennard told the committee that women hoping to become lib dem mps were given additional support and help in explaining the process of selection shortlisting and the selection campaign channel news last week quoted a former woman lib dem parliamentary candidate as saying that rennard shoved his hand down the back of my dress when she posed with him for a photograph the woman who asked to remain anonymous added i felt really humiliated and very undermined and very shameful some of the women complained about rennards behaviour to jo swinson the partys equalities spokesperson who is now minister for women as far back as swinson one of two lib dem mps on the speakers committee attended the hearing addressed by rennard in april she posed questions to other witnesses but not to rennard jasper gerard nick cleggs biographer who is standing for parliament for the lib dems against the equalities minister helen grant in maidstone and the weald played down the significance of the allegations against rennard gerard told radio s the world at one we are still now going on about whether somebody put his hand or didnt put his hand on somebodys knee this isnt the jimmy savile case revisited the poor representation of women at westminster will be addressed at a hansard society conference next month ann mckechin the former scotland office minister who will address the conference said the problems at westminster went far deeper than the fact that the overwhelming number of mps and peers were men mckechin said politics is a career in which your contacts are an absolutely vital part there are some careers where it doesnt make quite so much difference but in politics it is your contacts and alliances you make with people over a number of years that hold you in good stead for potentially building up a body of support to get a seat that is why people are reluctant to put their head above the parapet and say i have had a bad experience with x it might be seen as being disloyal to a political party dame anne begg the labour mp for aberdeen south who was vice chair of the speakers committee said that some modest progress has been made to improving the representation of women at westminster labour was emboldened to continue with its all women shortlists which meant that at the last two general elections more than of the labour mps elected were women because of the historical imbalance that still only means that a third of the parliamentary labour party are women but the figures are improving the tories are much further behind but they had their a list david cameron felt he had right on his side to get a bigger variety of candidates into the winnable seats but looking across the chamber the look of the parliamentary conservative party is very different from the one pre the one party that didnt do much was the lib dems that is partly because they are liberals and will not put in place these top down mechanisms liberals are not particularly in favour of quotas they say we want the best person for the job our argument is if the best person hasnt even applied for the job you cant get them,2013-02,many woman westminster mp aide minister lobbyist journalist complain encountering

who runs britain there are few meaningful opportunities for women according to mondays report on sex and power by counting women in a coalition of five organisations including the hansard society and unlock democracy david cameron says he wants more women around the cabinet table and he could of course get on and appoint them but the greater problem is the number in the room the commons still has the feel of a boys boarding school just over of mps are women and britain continues to fall down the international league tables allegations about the liberal democrats casting couch are very serious but the problem for those seeking selection for winnable seats goes far deeper than any risk of sexual harassment the electorate does not discriminate against women when presented with a choice but those selecting candidates at local level still prefer men i am often reminded by those who do not see the exclusion of women as a problem that the cream rises to the top but in politics so too does a fair amount of froth and hot air so far labours allwomen shortlists have been the most effective means to reduce the imbalance but surely something is wrong when you have to force a small selectorate to choose a woman candidate labours women still doesnt feel like a great success especially on those terms who wants to feel that they were the best woman and not the best candidate the conservatives experimented with open primaries at the last election but local hustings events made little difference to the proportion of women selected i was selected via the first allpostal open primary where every voter had the opportunity to select the candidate both such primaries returned a woman candidate caroline dinenage is also an mp as a result while that is too small for any statistical significance and too expensive to roll out at national level it is a shame there have been no pilots of lowercost options to engage more people in selections in safe seats which never change party allegiance candidate selections are in effect the election and it is worth continuing to explore ways to widen participation countering male bias also requires more women to consider politics in the first place all party leaders should be encouraging women from nonpolitical backgrounds to apply you dont need to have done politics to be an mp but it should be a necessity to have seen a bit of the real world i often ask women why they dont think of applying after all for all the negativity it is still one of the most interesting and demanding of roles the impact on family life deters the most and they are right to be concerned but it doesnt have to be that way we could learn from other professions that have embraced job sharing as a way to encourage and retain staff as they juggle family and career i jobshared for years as a doctor before coming to parliament its a wonderful way to work and it makes for builtin mentoring for mps it would allow for complementary experience that would broaden their combined expertise having worked in three different types of job share the secret of success is a close ethical fit with your partner and a similar approach to work as an mp i could not job share with an antiabortionist or a hanger and flogger i voted for same sex marriage but what if my jobshare partner felt equally strongly the other way the answer is to make sure you have a similar ethical framework before you start and to apply it as a pair where disagreements arise over policy issues then the vote goes with the manifesto commitment or majority constituency view in some circumstances the agreement would have to be to abstain but only one mp votes at any one time and they would share a single salary staff support office and london accommodationjob sharing opens parliament to more people with disabilities and does not exclude men who want to take on caring roles as well as hold down a career in politics legal opinion is that job sharing is perfectly compatible with being an mp it is time to start looking at how it can be made to work ultimately voters would decide they may well take note of job sharers in other professions who between them often deliver far more than a fulltime equivalent to those who say it will never work the question has to be does the current system always work out so well having a single mp is no guarantee you wont get a dud to deliver a more equal government takes decisive action at every level from encouraging applicants right through to camerons cabinet but time is running out if the prime minister wishes to see

british women are being squeezed out of power at an accelerating rate according to an explosive report published on monday female participation in politics and public life is plummeting and compares poorly with levels in many other european countries in years after the sex discrimination act was passed britain lay in th place out of countries in female representation in the democratic system a startling drop from rd in of western countries only italy and ireland have a lower percentage of female legislators than the uk in the european parliament britain does just as badly coming third from bottom with only female representatives half the number of sweden and finland and significantly below serbia slovenia and macedonia which all have more than female mps according to the report sex and power who runs britain published by counting women in a coalition of five organisations including the hansard society and unlock democracy the scarcity of female representation is replicated in many areas of public life including the judiciary the police the armed forces and the media the advancement of women has either regressed in the past years or increased only slightly the proportion of female mps in westminster has increased by only since while the percentage of women in the cabinet has decreased by it is simply scandalous that in men still outnumber women four to one in parliament said ceri goddard chief executive of campaigning charity the fawcett society which is part of the counting women in coalition the number of women in the cabinet is at a year low failure to increase the number of women around the top table of politics sends a message to the next generation that excluding women from positions of power is acceptable katie ghose chief executive of the electoral reform society added it is not a good look for the mother of parliaments to be lagging behind on the fundamental issue of womens representation among other ideas the report recommends a government campaign to increase the number of women standing in the general election monitoring who becomes a candidate and a consideration of quotas it provides a wealth of statistics on the extent of the continuing male monopoly on power twothirds of public appointments go to men of chief constables and police and crime commissioners are male and twothirds of local councillors are male yet men make up of the population alex runswick of unlock democracy said the lack of female involvement is a canary in the mining shaft a particularly visible example of how the system fails to represent people more

the guardians popup book club discussion of the feminine mystique starts wednesday at pm and will last for half an hour for our first chat well be focusing on the first pages essentially the first four chapters we wont talk about gail collinss excellent intro although i do recommend it she does help put the book into perspective those of you who are up to speed will know that in the first part of the book friedan looks at the image and identity of the mid thcentury woman and how marketing and media manipulate that image obviously well be looking at how thats changed or not but id like to start with the title and the definition of the word feminine friedans explanation of the yearold definition is that its a young middleclass careerless homemaker some questions to consider is feminine still a loaded word what does it mean to you does marketing still have an effect on how we interpret the word do womens magazines in the book friedan makes a direct connection between motherhood and depression is that still valid today i think it is what do you think are middleclass mothers less depressed if so why do you know any women who take antidepressants for example join us bookmark this page then visit us at pm et to add your thoughts to our discussion to participate use newmystique on twitter or add your thoughts in the comments below what we learned from the first pages emma keller whats changed in years blonde and thin is still presented to us as best fulltime motherhood can be isolating and depressing we have the vote but remain shy about running for office we dont have equal pay and glass ceilings exist everywhere from wall street to st peters square but this is a better world for women than the empty one presented by friedan im not interested in whether or not we are happier i find that a temporal selfindulgent thought my focus has always been on confidence not happiness and i would argue that the main difference between the climate of middleclass midthcentury america as described by friedan and now is that not only do we have more choices but we are more confident about making them janine gibson to my bewilderment not as much has changed as you might hope this leads me to well guilt really instead of a sort of pleasing historical romp an acknowledgement of how far weve come and a tribute to those who served which i had expected there were too many parallels two news stories i was following last night kelly clarksons row with archcontroller clive davis and the entirely manufactured outrage consuming the british tabloid press over hilary mantels superb essay on the publics ownership of a royal body seemed to me to suggest that not enough of our expectations of the way women should behave have changed i wondered how much i help perpetuate emma tweeted never reading another womens magazine i renounce the chic novelty of embracing domesticity nigella when i look at the passages i highlighted and the notes i made theyre a depressing litany of seemingly stalled debates on womens issues abortion harrassment forcible rape equality ways to make your marriage more exciting i wish more was new heidi moore what surprised me most about rereading the feminine mystique was the experience of traveling back through a wormhole looking back at the complaints of a previous generation and seeing what sounds dated and what sounds new whats dated women arent listless any more theyre filling up colleges and law schools whats new or at least current in friedans time as now femininity is not an identity femininity is a sales pitch to be woman is to be a consumer and not just any consumer but the urconsumer of every product from the home to the expensive creams and clothes heres a great friedan paragraph from page the feminine public image in the magazines and television commercials is designed to sell washing machines cake mixes deodorants detergents rejuvenating face creams hair tints as the motivational researchers keep telling the advertisers american women are so unsure of who they should be that they look to this glossy public image to decide every detail of their lives if you think those days are over look at pinterest which is almost entirely composed of what women want to buy to define their identities the womens magazines as well are run by women who increasingly espouse an impossibly glossy sterile dehumanized vision of women instead of twiggy s dolllike languor our models more often portray a kind of wolfish predatory and materialistic vision with handbags and platform heels that make chinese footbinding look enlightened its impossible not to think of mad men but not poor dismal betty was don draper the original feminist remember his old line on love what you call love was invented by guys like me to sell nylons youre born alone and you die alone and this world just drops a bunch of rules on top of you to make you forget those facts friedan would probably have agreed katie rogers the first few chapters gave me a new understanding of the world my grandmothers lived in they wouldve been young mothers when this book was written and i wish now that i could ask them if they read this book they were so different from each other but i know they both felt the frustration friedan details and dealt with it by passing on a message of independence to younger generations one of my grandmothers was a collegeeducated nurse who gave up her career and moved from new york to the midwest after marrying a doctor and having five daughters the other was one of the fieriest most alive women ive ever known uneducated but clever and savvy she married at and promptly had four boys both of them were defined completely by their marriage and their motherhood and i know both of them fiercely loved but were totally consumed by the families they had created so much of the advice they gave me as i grew up boiled down to finding myself before i found love and figuring out what i wanted out of life before making any permanent decisions about marriage or family the motivation behind their advice makes so much more sense now a highlighted passage that stood out to me and reminded me of them the problem is always being the childrens mommy or the ministers wife and never being myself,2013-02,guardian popup book club discussion feminine mystique start wednesday pm last half hour first chat well

there can be few routes to fleeting fame with a stronger chance of success than having a big bunch of kids while claiming some state benefits the latest household to be splashed all over the tabloids hails from gloucestershire and comprises yearold heather frost who has recently survived treatment for cancer her partner kids and two grandchildren the justification for the prurient intrusion of the press appears to be that they have after waiting many years finally arranged social accommodation in a single house with six bedrooms that may be appropriate to their needs cases like these form a staple ingredient of cheap newsprint it would be easy to imagine britains housing estates to be swarming with the offspring of the hyperfecund with their mums bent over the kitchen sink afraid to fart in case another one pops out unexpectedly there are million households with children in which at least one adult receives an out of work benefit of those precisely contain or more children there can be very few who are yet to be honoured with their own doublepage tabloid feature or their own tv show when that number was revealed through a freedom of information request in late the daily mail pointed out that each of those families could be entitled to at least in benefits per year theres no evidence as to whether those families do collect their full entitlements but if they did that would total m in annual benefits with a total benefits bill excluding pensioners of bn per year that means we could stop all payments to those families and the country would reduce its bill by less than one hundredth of however spectacular they may be as news stories economically and fiscally these families are entirely irrelevant media coverage of such spectacularly large families bolster the belief that people on benefits and young women in particular pop out sprogs as a matter of course to boost the size of the weekly benefit cheque or to secure a bigger better house in fact official figures show that those m benefitclaiming households have million kids between them an average of children per household pretty much identical to the reproduction rate for the population as a whole the fabricated scandals of the hyperfecund poor sit alongside the myth of families where no one has worked for three generations or the common misconceptions about the scale of benefit fraud it is often noted that such stories serve a propaganda function turning poor against poor and creating a public mood that will not only accept barbaric assaults on social security but actively welcome them like most such stories current coverage of the frost family and their difficult housing arrangements was not graced with a quote from say the child poverty action group or shelter but from representatives of the libertarian fundamentalist group the taxpayers alliance who apparently have nothing better to do than stick their noses into the wombs of the poor the sun dragged in tory mp gavin barwell to explain why this case justified the forthcoming benefits cap although only a handful of the estimated claimants threatened by the cap will have a household even vaguely resembling this one just why the member for croydon central should have informed insight into a case more than a hundred miles away remains a mystery there are legitimate ethical and practical questions as to whether people should have large families while unable to support them with anything more than paltry benefits such questions are all but eclipsed by the human costs of cutting the financial support offered to such families the tabloid press has never shied away from moralistic fingerpointing or the attractions of a garish family freak show but recent years have seen a trend away from a traditional puritanism towards a new morality that rests entirely upon financial demands on the state nowhere in the press coverage does anyone ask whether frosts children are happy well cared for and healthy the only issues are the adults employment status and the actually rather modest cost of the newly built house we are now lectured on morality not by fire and brimstone preachers banging a copy of the bible but by the slashand burn evangelists of neoliberal economics banging on a copy of the balance sheet,2013-02,route fleeting fame stronger chance success big bunch kid claiming state benefit latest

plans for mps to job share in parliament are being developed by the liberal democrats in an effort to increase the number of women elected and break up the male presenteeism culture that still dominates politics the idea is to be put to the lib dem spring conference next month as all three main parties struggle to find ways to increase female representation in parliament on monday david cameron admitted during a visit to india that there were not nearly enough conservative women mps and too few women in the cabinet and revealed that his wife samantha was pressing him to do more to open up his party he did not come up with any practical solutions many in his party fear that there will be fewer tory mps after the next election than at present because many women elected last time are in some of the most vulnerable seats the proposals for mp job shares comes in a wider paper on political reform prepared for the lib dem conference by its federal executive policymaking committee earlier in the year a private members bill in parliament called for job shares but failed to make progress the lib dems insist they would not be imposing jobsharing mps on constituents instead jobshare candidates would stand on a joint ticket and voters would choose whether or not to vote for them in the same way they decide whether or not to vote for any other candidate the report says if elected agreed protocols around voting serving on select committees and other mps duties would bind the jobshare candidates the paper says the rationale behind the proposal is that it could open up the role of mp to a much wider group of people than at present research shows that one of the main barriers to increasing womens participation in politics is perceived incompatibility with family life while evidence from professions such as medicine law and the senior civil service suggests that provision for parttime working significantly increases the talent pool of women progressing into senior roles ministers should also be free to share their portfolio with another mp from their party the paper says the idea raises issues such as whether the jobshare mps would vote consistently or develop a coherent line of argument the paper points out that currently in the commons men outnumber women four to one the lib dems lag behind the other major uk political parties the party in the commons comprises just women down from in the previous parliament there are currently no minority ethnic lib dem mps the paper concludes that the party urgently needs a distinctive policy a speakers conference in january looked at the issue of female underrepresentation in parliament but failed to galvanise radical change the report identified the problem of pervasive systemic barriers to political participation by underrepresented groups including cost time and resource barriers facing wouldbe activists and candidates from underrepresented groups presenteeist cultures and inflexible working practices in political parties and institutions including constituency expectations commons sitting hours absence of parental leave the lib dem report claims academic evidence is unambiguous internationally the only countries to have achieved equality of representation have done so through statutory equality guarantees cameron disclosed his wife had pressed him to do more on women in public life he said my wife likes to say that if you dont have women in the top places you are not just missing out on of the talent you are missing out on a lot more than of the talent and i think she probably has a point he said he added we still have a long way to go if you look at the top businesses in britain there still arent nearly enough women in the boardroom if you look at politics in britain there arent nearly enough women around the cabinet table and he said the tory party had only women mps before the last election we have around now we have made a big change but it is only out of so its not nearly enough so we need to do more,2013-02,plan mp job share parliament developed liberal democrat effort increase number woman elected break male presenteeism culture still dominates

it is not just a handful of academics as the dwp claims who question the way the government is trying to redefine poverty ministers accused of downplaying income in measure of child poverty february no academic i have spoken to thinks it is a good idea more importantly any objective observer acknowledges that the significant progress made by the previous government in reducing child poverty by a third will be undone by present policies and trends labour fell short of its ambitious incomepoverty targets and did not resolve some underlying issues such as educational inequalities although it did make some inroads there that is no reason either to say that income is unimportant or to deny the indisputable evidence that children are damaged by growing up in the material hardship that results from low family income donald hirsch director centre for research in social policy loughborough university as i feel very strongly about the rising numbers of children living in poverty i decided to contribute to the consultation document on measuring child poverty produced by the education department and the dwp i expected that i would be given an opportunity to express my position which is retain the current measures of child poverty continue to publish data showing how its policies are affecting incomes as it does in the households below average income report account against the measures set out in the child poverty act filling in the consultation document took two hours and left me angry and frustrated the questions and tickboxes gave me no opportunity to voice these legitimate views and so i had to use the comment boxes for all questions to challenge the assumptions of the questions and narrowness of the options i am not an academic but i have filled in enough questionnaires in my life to know when i am being manipulated jean goodrick cambridge the dwps attempt to dismiss the group that wrote to the guardian letters february as a handful of academics provided an early morning laugh given that its own officials are admitting that views very similar to the letter are emerging in responses to the consultation from right across the academic community it is all the more important that these and other responses be made publicly available so the governments own summary of the views can be subject to scrutiny a government that appears increasingly seriously addicted to demonising people in poverty especially when they are receiving benefits needs to pay more serious attention to an urgent warning that they are moving into evidencefree policies

antirape campaigners have dismissed proposals for alleged rapists to be granted anonymity to avoid lasting stigma if they are cleared jill saward who was raped in when suspected rapists had anonymity hit back at calls by leading criminal barrister maura mcgowan for the law to again prohibit the naming of suspects she said the suggestion by mcgowan the chair of the bar council which represents barristers in england and wales risked reducing the chance of serial rapists being convicted and could place women in danger if they did not know a man had been accused of rape mcgowan said the time was right for ministers to consider a law change because of the stigma attached to rape accusations that could damage lives even in cases where charges are not brought or a suspect is acquitted not all of these rape accusations are true and the damage that can be done to somebodys life a teacher doctor or priest can be overwhelming if it turns out at the end of the case that the allegation isnt true she said these cases are peculiar unto themselves because the stigma quite often can do so much damage a victim or a witness in an assault or a robbery will not be given anonymity no matter how horrible the case is but in a sexual allegation they will we have made special rules in these cases mcgowans stance was backed by terry harrison who was falsely accused of rape five years ago innocent until proven guilty is a load of rubbish he said i was guilty until i was proven innocent and even when i was proven innocent im still getting judged i ended up going to jail for something i didnt do i was in the paedophile wing the rapists wing the grass wing i was there for three months before the dna results finally came back negative but the stigma is always there the call for a rethink follows a series of recent highprofile cases where men have been named as rape suspects before charge or trial there was widespread publicity last week when manchesterbased violin teacher wen zhou li was accused of rape and in december when tv presenter stuart hall was arrested on suspicion of rape by detectives involved in operation yewtree dealing with the alleged crimes of jimmy savile and others in may the coalition government agreed to reintroduce anonymity for rape suspects after it was removed in following widespread pressure the government dropped the idea five months later citing insufficient reliable empirical evidence saward who was the victim of the high profile ealing vicarage rape in in which her father and boyfriend also received fractured skulls in a daytime burglary said anonymity for suspects had a terrible effect on victims i wasnt allowed to know anything about the men she said it was horrible because there was a sense they werent real people it felt like i was dealing with ghosts saward a campaigner for rape victims has supported men who have been wrongfully accused of rape including one friend who was shunned as a result of a whispering campaign about an alleged rape and continued to suffer from mental illness from the strain year later but the key reason the system should remain in place is that we know that rapists rarely have one victim she said many people feel their case is too weak on its own and if the name of the suspect is made public it brings out other victims it also enables people to judge for themselves whether to trust someone or not and put themselves in danger she cited the case of the socalled black cab rapist john worboys and said that if he had been granted anonymity as a suspect other victims may not have come forward to reveal the true extent of his crime holly dustin director of the end violence against women coalition said mcgowans idea was driven by the myth that there were a large number of false allegations in rape cases and it would be detrimental to our justice system it would be unfair added the shadow home secretary yvette cooper to single out rape defendants to remain anonymous and would send a message to juries and to victims that uniquely in rape cases the victim should not be believed,2013-02,antirape campaigner dismissed proposal alleged rapist granted anonymity avoid lasting stigma cleared jill

hundreds of thousands of children will fall into poverty in the next few years unless urgent steps are taken to ensure that the poorest are protected from impending budget cuts imposed on local authorities by whitehall the claim is made by end child poverty a coalition of more than charities welfare organisations social justice groups and unions that this week publishes a map of uk poverty blackspots the map which uses similar measurements of poverty to those employed by the government found that in wards in the uk most children were classed as living in poverty down from wards the previous year however the drop was largely due to falling incomes having skewed the relative poverty threshold defined as families on or below of median household income the campaign predicts that as benefits start to fall in real terms later this year the proportion of children living in poverty will increase significantly it cites work by the institute for fiscal studies that predicts more children will end up in poverty by rising to by the campaigns map reveals that the worst affected constituency is manchester central where of children are classed as living in poverty just ahead of belfast west and glasgow north east where the figure is in birmingham ladywood and bethnal green and bow in london of children are classed as living in poverty the new figures reveal the wide disparity in poverty rates within regions in london poplar and limehouse has a child poverty rate of compared with in richmond in the north west of england of children in manchester are poor compared with in the nearby ribble valley in the north east the relative decline in child poverty rates is already being reversed prompting concerns that cuts will exacerbate the northsouth divide in wards such as thorntree in middlesbrough and grangetown in redcar and cleveland more than of children are classed as living in poverty there are far too many areas of the country where poverty scars the lives of more than a third of children living in the local community said enver solomon chair of the end child poverty coalition and director at the national childrens bureau it is a tragedy that so many children whose parents are struggling to making a living are having to go hungry and miss out on the essentials of a decent childhood that all young people should be entitled to the introduction of the bedroom tax which will see a reduction in benefits for families with a spare room and changes to who receives support with paying council tax will end up costing the most vulnerable more say welfare groups the resolution foundation predicts that lowincome families will see their council tax rise by up to a year as a result of the changes from april local authorities will be given greater discretion over the allocation of financial support for families already a number of authorities have said they will not be introducing council tax support schemes claiming they cannot afford them but end child poverty said it was vital authorities used their new powers to ensure money went to the most vulnerable local authorities are having to deal with reduced budgets but they must prioritise lowincome families in the decisions they make about local welfare spending including spending on the new council tax benefit and on protecting families hit by the bedroom tax solomon said they have a critical role to play in developing effective local strategies to tackling child poverty one in five children is currently classed as living below the poverty line although the definition of what is poor is due to be revised the government has been consulting on a new definition of child poverty which includes income but also wider measures to tackle the root causes of poverty including worklessness educational failure and family breakdown a department for work and pensions spokesman said the previous government had set a target of reducing the number of children living in relative income poverty to m by last year but the figure had actually risen to m despite paying out bn in tax credits over the last decade alone the previous government failed to meet their target to halve child poverty by and far too many children were left behind the spokesman explained our welfare reforms will improve the lives of some of the poorest families in our communities with the universal credit simplifying the complex myriad of benefits and making million people better off the spokesman added but end child poverty said it feared the changes would have the opposite effect our map shows that in every region the gross disparities in child poverty levels that have existed for many years are deeply entrenched and are set to become an enduring reality as many more children become trapped

the comments by david jones the welsh secretary that samesex couples are unable to provide a safe environment for bringing up children represent a view which those who have experience of placing children with such couples and have been able to follow their development over a period of years cannot endorse the capacity to parent is not related to sexuality indeed there are children who were born into a family with parents who were married to each other and have suffered abuse and neglect in those families coram has experience of placing children with gay and lesbian adopters over a period of years our approach to adoption is childcentred in that we are looking for parents with the particular qualities needed in adopters particularly adopters of children who have suffered neglect abuse of other trauma and are likely to have additional needs throughout their childhood we therefore do not have a blueprint of the kind of family who might be suitable to adopt rather we start from the premise that we need parents who will be committed to the child they adopt for the long term parents who can understand the emotional baggage that the children are likely to bring with them the children who need adoptive families often have experienced broken attachments and have had relationships with parents and other carers who were unreliable and often punitive they therefore have little trust in adults or expectation that they will be able to care for them they need parents who can withstand rejection and provide opportunities for the child to enjoy positive experiences and gradually discover that it is safe to be a child and to depend on the adults adopters also need to feel comfortable with the reality that their child has another set of biological parents and to be able to help their child make sense of his or her identity as she grows up research has demonstrated that one of the most important qualities in an adoptive parent is empathy the ability to see things from another persons point of view and try to understand where they are coming from this is not something linked to sexual orientation but to peoples life experience and how they have processed difficult experiences in their own lives thus we are seeking adopters whose life experience has equipped them for this task who have confidence in themselves and who help their child to feel that the world is a safe place recent research by susan golombok of the university of cambridge which was published last year compared the outcomes for children adopted by heterosexual gay and lesbian couples this research confirmed the experience of adoption agencies such as coram which have placed children with samesex couples over a period of time that these parents are capable of providing loving secure homes in which children thrive children in samesex adoptive households face different challenges than those raised by heterosexual couples many heterosexual couples come to adoption after an extended period of infertility treatment and for them there may be a challenge to put aside their feelings of loss and to enjoy parenting their adopted children without feelings of regret for the ideal fantasy child on the other hand children raised by samesex couples may face homophobic comments and need additional support from their parents to deal with these however the key for all these children is that above all they need the experience of having parents who love them and can give them the experience of feeling valued for themselves something that most children can take fore granted if they are to develop the inner strength and resilience to cope with the ordinary challenges of life they need the confidence that comes from being loved and feeling secure,2013-02,comment david jones welsh

a few months ago i was invited to give a talk this coming march about my book vagina a new biography at a new womenonly club in london named grace belgravia i was happy to discuss the subject in a private allfemale setting in a discussion moderated by a figure in british feminism whom i have long admired rosie boycott it was intriguing too that the club seemed designed to be a challenge to or at least a twist upon the network of allmale spaces that have so long supported british and american power hegemonies but when the event changed to a more public one my comfort level with an allfemale invitation list changed as well i asked the organizers to open the event to both genders which to their credit they did viv groskop in the independent citing the womenonly language on the invitation wrote presumably if mrs carter wanted to attend mr carter would have to stay at home how is this any different to a golf club in the s i can understand that people are tired of all the rhetoric and of waiting for things to change and so theyre taking drastic action by reviving the sisterhood in both thought and deed but there is a very fine line being crossed here you end up creating a mirror image of the exclusive and excluding public spaces that feminism once fought against i agree with groskop in important ways and critically when it comes to any public event or institution yet i also see value for women and men too even in a truly egalitarian world in maintaining some kinds of samesex spaces the idea of a womenonly club at all or womenonly schools and programs at this stage of feminism raises important questions about whether samesex spaces in general have any value or validity any more is there indeed a line that separates valuable womenonly spaces from those that are discriminatory or counterproductive in my mind there is such a line feminism in the s was based on the truism that every woman needed a room of ones own a phrase that drew on virginia woolfs framing of the value of allfemale colleges in the essay by that name the phrase in turn became a clich spawning a thousand feminist books and college courses with of their own in the title and indeed allfemale gatherings did radicalize the generation western feminists of the s who were fighting a selfconcept that had defined them always in relationship to men and male needs whether it was the aha about invisible discrimination realized in a consciousnessraising group the awareness of samesex passion discovered in a lesbian retreat or the context of a group of women learning about their sexuality from feminist sex educators such as betty dodson the insights that emerged from these womenonly gatherings would have been unreachable in mixed groups there are still breakthroughs in skills acquisition learning and leadership that happen most easily in womenonly settings grameen bank has a record of great achievement with small business entrepreneurship by training lowincome women in all female settings so much so that it is a target for government seizure as does the barefoot college in tilonia india founded by bunker roy in and the subject of a recent documentary by jehane noujaim rafea solar mamathis program turns desperately impoverished illiterate women from columbia kenya and jordan into solar engineers within a sixmonth training period the film shows how the sisterhood support and freedom from male intervention and control liberate these womens capabilities and confidence similar boosts to female leadership and selfesteem have long been documented in graduates of allfemale us colleges such as smith and wellesley and from the until recently singlesex st hildas and st hughs and i have seen the vast leaps in confidence and skill set acquisition that comes from allfemale training settings in the young womens leadership program i cofounded the woodhull institute counselors who work with male abusers know that an allmale setting allows for more personal responsibility to be taken on as men confront their peers the girl guides and boy guides sex segregation allows both genders to focus on learning that supports their own development for these reasons i do see value in some singlesex programs and settings even today but when there is now a trend of femaletomale transgender smith undergraduates raising questions about what is a smithie and even what is a woman or a man how do we justify womenonly events training or ideologies how do we justify them when the best and most appealing version of feminism on college campuses is one in which young men feel included in exploring gender issues and have a place in championing fairness to women and how do they make sense after what i saw when we sent young female alumni from woodhull with new financial skills back to their lowincome neighborhoods and their boyfriends clamored rightly for a program of their own even on college campuses young women and young men reasonably ask whether there should even be a womens center at all my best sense is that all public institutions events and gatherings should be open to all without discrimination but is there is still a place for the occasional samesex discussion group training program and private gathering i believe there is in my ideal world so long as we have a larger goal that what is learned separately is always directed back to a discussion

before the election shirani benedict a lifelong labour voter thought it was time for a change i voted for david cameron because i thought he would be different i thought things would get better said the yearold but like the chill wind that whipped around her daughters school in watford her feelings have cooled i wont be voting for him again why there are so many issues where do you want me to start women like benedict are making some in the conservative party very nervous an icmguardian poll this week giving labour a point lead over the conservatives for the first time in almost a decade also suggested a wide and growing voting gender gap while labour had a sevenpoint lead over the tories among men among women it was points women have been prolabour in consecutive guardianicm polls with a double digit difference in each of the last six said martin boon director of icm research it is wise to express caution about the latest development as sample sizes are based on about female votes and similar for men but for this to be such a consistent theme is no doubt worth remarking upon he said dr rosie campbell expert in voting and gender at birkbeck university of london said from the beginning david cameron talked about the worklife balance trying to win back women attracted by new labour but he has delivered a noxious combination of cuts to child tax credits child benefit public sector roles more likely to be held by women pensions and fears over the nhs childcare and further education were turning women off you cant get away with relying on the rhetoric if that is not what women are feeling on the ground deborah mattinson founder of britain thinks agrees women feel much harder hit by the problems facing the country they also tend to look at things from a family perspective and are concerned about their childrens job prospects homes and education she said the conservatives are going to have to work very hard to turn this around after extra welfare cost savings were announced in the autumn budget yvette cooper shadow minister for women and equalities argued that of new direct tax tax credit and benefit changes would hit women i think what were seeing now and for a long period of time is that david cameron personally and the government has a serious blind spot when it comes to women said cooper the government talks about ending dependency on the public sector but women know it is those measures that allow you to become independent in watford a threeway marginal for many women appeared largely unconcerned about cuts to the public sector but were worried about the cost of childcare and spiralling living costs childcare was the first issue many mentioned after travel and childcare i had an extra a month so whats the point was a typical refrain another woman said shed worked full time but had unwillingly reduced her hours because it wasnt worth the hassle for the cost several were concerned about proposed changes from early years minister elizabeth truss that would allow carers to look after more children im good at my job but im not an octopus said one childcare worker in the watford library if you speak to mums they want the best quality care for their kids this might be cheaper but a lot of people are worried that it wont be as good she said for me labour seem much more pro young education because they opened sure start centres and that is what i believe in the tories had to focus on the family and fast if they were to win back the female vote said paul goodman executive editor of conservativehome and a former conservative mp frankly the government family policy is a dogs breakfast there are lots of people banging lots of different drums the tory party was very very very concerned about womens votes he added however theres no need for downing street to panic it simply needs to keep trying to get the economy right and get a grip on family policy because it will be more difficult to close the gender gap with no one in charge of family policy recent events such as infighting over gay marriage the continuing economic squeeze and cuts to public sector jobs were also likely to have played a part obviously its not easier in coalition and it wont get any better during the byelection in eastleigh he said as in america where barack obama won of the female vote in november western women tended to be more socially leftwing than men but this had not been the case in the first four decades of womens suffrage in britain before women entered the workforce in far greater numbers said tim bale professor of politics at queen mary university of london and the author of the conservatives since the drivers of party change its interesting to note that women punished labour in the austerity years after the second world war while the tory emphasis on inflation has traditionally appealed to voters making daily consumer decisions he said once again women were finding themselves on the frontline of squeezed budgets while bearing the brunt of public sector cuts for women trying to balance the weekly budget in watford the rising cost of living as well as stalled wages and a stagnant economy was putting them under increasing pressure you speak to most people and they think this is the worst the countrys ever been said genevieve brannon a yearold mother who works parttime you watch all the prices all the time and you think youve got ahead on one thing and then something else goes up everything is going up except salaries she said there werewas some voices of comfort for cameron in watford town centre tara oldham a yearold brand coordinator said she was willing to give cameron a chance i wont vote lib dem they are woolly bleeding heart liberals with no spine and labour forgets about the working man on the street she said i grew up in the thatcher years i love maggie but cameron will do for now shirani benedict her daughter safely bundled in the car was much less complimentary i just dont trust him theres something about him that just makes me not believe him asked if labour had won back her vote she was not convinced i dont even know who to vote for any more,2013-02,election shirani benedict lifelong labour voter thought wa time change voted david cameron thought would different thought thing would get better said yearold like chill wind whipped

a group of senior academics warn in a letter to the guardian today that the governments desire to alter the official definition of child poverty risks deliberately downplaying the importance of money just as a series of government policies will reduce the incomes of poor families as a government consultation on how to measure child poverty more accurately comes to an end the academics write we agree that as well as tracking how many children are in poverty as currently measured it is helpful to track what is happening to the factors that lead to poverty and the barriers to childrens life chances but it does not make sense to combine all of these into a single measure to do so would open up the government to the accusation that it aims to dilute the importance of income in monitoring the extent of poverty at precisely the time that its policies will be reducing the real incomes of poor families we call on the government to reconsider its proposals and amelia gentleman reports that

number of carers increased in authorities and fell only in six in birmingham the number of unpaid carers increased by more than the highest increase in the extent of unpaid care occurred in the hours

divorce is never pleasant or simple but it is a lot more painful and complicated if children are involved first there is the emotional pain then there is the small matter of money for divorcing couples who dont have children breaking up is relatively straightforward you divvy up the assets between the two of you and get on with the rest of your lives divorce with children is much more difficult and the younger they are the trickier it is child maintenance is a ferociously complicated area says christina blacklaws director of family law at cooperative legal services the recent partial replacement of the child support agency with the child maintenance service means that many people find it even more challenging than before maintenance costs child maintenance can be paid to the father or the mother depending on who is looking after the children whoever pays the money is known as the nonresident parent in legal terms in most cases that is the exhusband or father what you pay depends on what you earn if you earn less than a week you pay nothing if you earn between and you pay a flat rate of a week no matter how many children are involved if you earn up to a week you pay that flat rate plus a percentage of your aftertax weekly income that is of your income for the first child for two children and for three or more if you earn more than a week you will pay of your aftertax weekly income for one child for two and for three or more find out further details here pdf if the nonresident parent does a share of the childcare these figures will be reduced accordingly blacklaws explains if say the kids regularly stay with dad two nights a week he would only pay fivesevenths of his child maintenance obligations couples can do their own sums using the child maintenance calculator although this can be tricky if the nonresident parent doesnt declare all their earnings a particular problem where people do cashinhand jobs such as selfemployed building work you pay child maintenance up to age or if the child is still in fulltime education but only up to alevels and equivalent you arent obliged to fund your children through university private school fees can sometimes be an issue blacklaws says if a child goes to a private school and the father wants them to go to the local comprehensive instead the case can often end up in court the family home a key priority is making sure the children continue to have a roof over their heads husbands often come to me expecting to sell the house and walk away with half of its value says peter watsonlee a family law specialist at williams thompson solicitors in christchurch dorset im left with the unpleasant task of explaining this isnt necessarily the case if there arent many other assets to divide the wife assuming she is the primary carer and children will often be allowed to continue living at the house the court may say the house can only be sold with the exhusband getting his share after their education is over says watsonlee a man with young children could wait years or more and have to pay his share of the mortgage in the meantime if either partner starts a new relationship things get even more complicated if the mother moves in with a partner or gets married that wont affect the fathers maintenance obligations to his children he will have to keep paying out exactly as before but any obligation to pay maintenance to the exwife will cease if she remarries or in some cases cohabits if a father moves in with a new partner and the new partner has children from a previous relationship who live with them he may have to pay less child maintenance to his own children negotiations the government wants most couples to sort child maintenance between themselves either by negotiating a familybased arrangement or failing that using the csa most couples sort out their problems without going near a court but if one parent refuses to pay the other parent may have to ask the csa to enforce its maintenance assessment the csa can only take into account net income of up to a week when making its assessment says rhona adams accredited family law specialist at morton fraser in edinburgh if the paying parent earns more their expartner can apply to the court for additional topup maintenance things get tricky if one partner is living or working abroad in this case the courts do have power to enforce an application for maintenance the eu maintenance regulation of covers this and the uk also has reciprocal agreements with many other countries she says where a cohabiting couple separate the mother has few legal rights to maintenance for herself but she may be able to claim maintenance for her children through the csa children are expensive the lifetime cost of bringing up a child is according to research from insurer lv to cover that both partners will need to pay their share for all the latest news and deals sign up for our weekly money talks email this

the governments desire to alter the official definition of child poverty risks deliberately downplaying the importance of money just as a series of government policies will reduce the incomes of poor families a group of senior academics warn in a letter to the guardian a consultation on how to measure child poverty more accurately that was launched last november seeking input from charities and experts into better measures of child poverty comes to an end on friday the government believes that a wider definition of what constitutes poverty will give a better picture of what it means to grow up experiencing deep disadvantage the letter signed by some of the countrys leading academics in this field agrees that in addition to the current measures used to count the number of children living in poverty it would be helpful to track what is happening to the factors that lead to poverty and the barriers to childrens life chances but they warn it does not make sense to combine all of these into a single measure to do so would open up the government to the accusation that it aims to dilute the importance of income in monitoring the extent of poverty at precisely the time that many of its policies will be reducing the real incomes of poor families professor jonathan bradshaw the lead consultant on the uks contribution to unicefs child wellbeing report said he believed that the government was trying to move the goalposts at a time when child poverty was increasing rapidly he described the consultation document as the worst paper setting down government policy direction he had ever read questioned whether it was written by civil servants and said it read more like it had been plagiarised from a rightwing thinktank tract he said civil servants had been working for the past years on developing accurate poverty measures but the document had ignored previous work by the department on the subject as well as ignoring work by academics in the field the new approach would not work because it attempted to combine all sorts of things that are the consequence of poverty or may be even be the causes of poverty but are not a measure of child poverty another signatory professor john hills of the lse said there was widespread support for the idea of looking more broadly at what causes poverty but warned against trying to compress social factors such as whether a childs parents are divorced unemployed or unwell into the measure of a familys income the result would be confusing and would have the effect of masking rising numbers of people in poverty he said by putting these apples and pears together in a way that downplays the actual resources that families on low incomes have got the suspicion would be that that is happening because we expect those numbers may go in the wrong direction in the next few years he said in a speech to launch the consultation iain duncan smith the work and pensions secretary outlined his theory that other factors aside from money caused poverty highlighting his concern about children growing up in dysfunctional families he argued it cannot be right that experiences so vital to childhood like seeing a parent go out to work or growing up in a stable family are not reflected in our understanding of child poverty he was critical of the labour governments focus on income as the significant cause and solution responding to the letter the dwp said despite a staggering bn being poured into benefits and tax credits over the last decade the previous government missed its own child poverty targets its disappointing that a handful of academics are backing the current approach to tackling child poverty which has failed far too many children in this country several childrens charities expressed concern about the direction of government policy on thursday enver solomon of the national childrens bureau said the government should urgently review its approach to child poverty and look at methods used successfully elsewhere

one female conservative mp tells a story about how in the weeks after the influx of new female tories into the house of commons at the last election some of her male colleagues struggled to tell them apart instead they resorted to calling any or all of the new women caroline that story from inside the partys own parliamentary ranks reflects the wider suspicion of the tories among women voters although icm polls for the guardian fluctuate the tories have a longstanding problem with the female vote this weeks poll shows that labour has a seven point lead over the tories among men but a point one among women downing street has long been aware of the problem and last year appointed a special adviser to focus solely on policies that might appeal to women but now party advisers are warning that their greatest asset in the campaign to win back women voters the fresh intake of tory women mps from the elections could be under threat and that the increase in women mps could even go into reverse after the big jump in tory women mps at the last general election from to any reduction would be a blow to david cameron who made getting more women on to the partys green benches a very personal mission the conservative party is in the process of selecting candidates for the new seats they have targeted as vital to their chances of winning a majority at the election and the emerging list of names is seen as a crucial test of whether it stands a chance of increasing womens representation so far have been selected of whom just four are women although the party has also chosen a woman maria hutchings as a candidate in the eastleigh byelection after those attention will turn to how many women are selected for safe retirement seats giving them an even better chance of getting elected there are a lot of us very focused on making sure there are more tory women mps after including the pm who is totally committed to it said lady jenkin a longtime party activist and chair of the partys support group womenwin but its not a done deal because it depends on the individuals being as good as blokes better in some cases a high proportion of the intake of women mps are in marginal seats which will be the hardest to hold meanwhile the abandonment of proactively prowomen policies such as allwomen candidate shortlists with a minimum of three out of six women for new candidate seats could compound that problem some mps also point towards structural and longrunning problems of life as an mp the continuing and offputting pressures of the long hours often far from home and constant media and public scrutiny highlighted by stories in the last year such as the one about caroline spelmans teenage sons obsession with bodybuilding supplements and culture secretary maria millers expenses others revive memories of the highprofile resignation of chick lit author louise mensch taking the tory women mp count down to when the party lost the byelection and the outcry over nadine dorriess decision to take part in the reality tv show im a celebrity both of which some in the party fear may deter selection boards from picking women candidates however sarah newton one of those new tory mps in the marginal truro and falmouth seat and who is the partys deputy chairman with particular responsibility for women believes the effort that has gone into talent spotting and nurturing highquality female candidates and the dogged work by mps in marginal seats to first win them and since to hold up the vote will prevent losses in two years time im confident its doable but its tough she says even if some women need to retire after losing some of the people we have chosen will be elected certainly our ambition is to constantly improve on our achievements in,2013-02,one

let me be clear im a feminist playwright and proud of it im also a presbyterian pastor ive built a successful career marrying these peculiar maledefined vocations when the faith and spirituality site beliefnet invited me to blog for them i was delighted in my circles beliefnet is a wellknown resource writing for them would add national scope to my own website and blog blending my unique expertise i suggested the title notes from a feminist pastor but before the ink was dry on the contract beliefnet asked me to delete the word feminist a beliefnet representative wrote to me were concerned about the negative connotation that our readers may associate with the word well want this blog to focus more on christianityspirituality as opposed to issues related to feminism what do you think of sweet truths with kristine holmgren i told them to take a hike i cant work where feminism is not celebrated im proud to call myself a feminist and why shouldnt i be feminism proclaims all people are created equal irrespective of our gender it is the simple belief that women are people entitled to respect protection and equity under the law im old enough to remember prefeminism and the bad old days before feminism saved us i remember when newspapers listed employment opportunities under two categories help wantedmale and help wantedfemale administrative assistants were men secretaries were women custodians were men maids were women never mind that they did the same tasks equal pay for equal work was never a consideration i remember my first job interview the hiring manager asked if i was married if i planned to marry my boyfriends name his age his occupation and when i planned to have children every question was legal not one was asked of the men interviewed and i remember when all girls were expected to find a good guy marry after high school take their husbands names get pregnant and disappear but my generation of women had other plans for our futures we were not about to march lockstep into motherhood nor would we settle for the deadend lowpaying jobs our older sisters hated and suffered instead we raised a royal riotous ruckus we marched we yelled we shut down businesses we fought for equal rights in the workplace equal funding for education for athletics we fought for abortion rights equal pay for equal work protection against sexual and domestic violence we did so because it was the right thing to do we were feminists and we still are make no mistake the work we did to bring about social change was done so at great personal sacrifice every time a woman rose to speak for freedom of choice a personal reputation was ruined even so my generation of women thought nothing of defending the rights of other women at the price of our own futures we measured the loss and found it worthy of the gain feminism made us sisters individually we were impotent females together we were a social force historians call us the second wave of the womens movement we were born after women gained the voting franchise in some ways our call to action was more difficult than our mothers once achieved the vote will never disappear not so with our accomplishments apparently for example a recent poll by the pew research center released in january found that over the past two decades the further we get from the ruling on roe v wade the less young people appear to know about it among those younger than only polled knew the case was about abortion thought it had to do with school desegregation beliefnet and its staffers do not understand the stake in forgetting our history and trivializing the sacrifice of previous generations heres what they told me i agree with the ideals of feminism but our readers are offended by feminism and we cant risk offending our readers consider the many titles that offend liberal environmentalist progressive humanist its time i think to reclaim them all time to start calling ourselves who and what we are with pride and purpose think of how hopeful the world would be if every progressive was proud of the title eager to find likeminded folks imagine your local city council confronting a room fool of people calling themselves liberals without apology do you think our common life would be changed if corporations had to contend with outspoken strong environmentalists committed to securing a healthy prosperous planet imagine a world where men women and children were proud to say who they are and what they believe it is time to reclaim freedom of thought freedom of choice freedom of selfdefinition

nearly million children are living materially deprived lives yet are not included in the governments headline measurement of child poverty the influential think tank policy exchange says today in a report that is expected to affect government thinking on how to measure child poverty the current target does not take into account social poverty indicators such as whether a child has been in the care system whether one or both of the childs parents has a criminal conviction or the quality of housing the child lives in policy exchange argues that once these factors are taken into account a much greater number of children are actually in poverty almost all previous discussion of child poverty has focussed on material poverty especially the poverty relative to average incomes the work and pensions secretary ian duncan smith who has delivered many speeches on broadening the scope of the approach to child poverty is likely to view the suggestions sympathetically but it is unlikely that he will abolish the existing targets as opposed to adding to them the report claims the labour target based entirely on income led to an increase of nonwork contingent benefits over work contingent benefits as a result child tax credit rose by compared to working tax credit which rose by between and the report calculates the government has spent billion between and trying to alleviate poverty since the increase in net financial support for the poorest households with children amounts to a year above inflation it points out the emergency budget and spending review committed to billion through child tax credit in order to avoid changes in the headline measure of child poverty over a two year period it claims these hand outs simply mask the problem and do not tackle the root causes of why households are in poverty the policy exchange report suggests the current measure should be replaced with a new piece of legislation that covers both household income and social poverty factors such as whether a child has been in the care system or lives in poor quality housing matthew oakley head of economics and social policy at policy exchange said the current measure of child poverty needs changing simply assessing whether a child is in poverty on the basis of household income fails to take into consideration a number of serious issues it leads us to think we are improving outcomes for children when in fact they can still be living severely deprived lives he said that a new measure focused on income as well as factors such as the quality of housing and level of education would likely increase the number of children in poverty but he added it would allow the government to focus policy solutions on improving outcomes both now and in the future for deprived children rather than simply masking the problem with state hand outs that do nothing to get to the root of the poverty problem,2013-02,nearly million child living materially deprived life yet included government headline measurement child poverty influential think tank policy exchange say today report expected affect government thinking measure child poverty current target doe take account social

the children and families bill which had its first reading on monday delivers on this governments determination to radically and permanently reform adoption so that neglected and abused children get the stable and loving homes they need im very proud that much of the bill flows from recommendations i have made to michael gove and until recently childrens minister tim loughton it has been a difficult road and undoubtedly a controversial one sometimes that controversy has been the natural result of the government tackling genuinely sensitive issues contact between children and birth relatives placing children with their wouldbe adopters but in a fostering capacity while the legal processes unfold or offering adopters personal budgets to allow them to buy in support all included in this bill but much the most controversial issue has been the move to reduce the emphasis given to ethnicity culture linguistic background and religion when matching a child to adopters that there is a problem is not in doubt black children wait a year longer to be adopted than white children and some black children simply grow out of the chance of adoption losing for all time the chance of the love and stability that every child needs it is frequently sometimes mischievously suggested that in changing the law on ethnicity and adoption the government is suggesting that ethnicity doesnt matter that is simply not true what the government is doing and partly as a result of my urging is ensuring that ethnicity and cultural considerations do not unnecessarily veto an otherwise satisfactory adoption there is an important history here in the immediate postwar years black and mixedrace children in care were extremely unlikely to be put forward for adoption childrens case files were stamped as unadoptable reflecting a belief that predominantly white adopters would not countenance the adoption of a black child this attitude persisted well into the s until the adoption of black children into white homes became commonplace but by the end of the s race emerged again as a factor this time based on a belief that it was not in a black childs interests to be adopted by a white family transracial placements as they become known were frowned upon in the association of black social workers told a commons select committee transracial placement as an aspect of current child care policy is in essence a microcosm of the oppression of black people in this society it is in essence a form of internal colonization a new form of slave trade government guidance at that time was remarkably pretty close to the black social workers view but evidence first emerging toward the end of the s demonstrated that there was no basis for the belief that ethnic matching was vital to the success of an adoption by paul boateng destined to become the uks first black cabinet minister was critical of local authorities who still refuse to place children for adoption because one of the prospective parents is deemed the wrong colour labours adoption and children act made plain that avoiding delay in adoption was the priority and that children should not wait in order to be adopted by parents of the same ethnicity culture religion or linguistic background but local authorities have been slow to change although some at last have begun to adjust their policies others appear unmoved and continue to emphasise race above other considerations for example sheffields adoption website today refers to children who may be of black or dual heritage and need to be placed in families which are able to meet their ethnic and cultural needs it is not that race does not matter the advice i have given to michael gove is that if there are two sets of adopters interested in adopting a black child black adopters have an advantage but when as is so often the case there are not enough black adopters available then to continue to emphasise race is cruelly disadvantageous to black children in a recent issue of be my parent magazine which essentially advertises children waiting for adoption a little boy t who has significant developmental delay is described t was born with spina bifida and will need continued medical support including from a neurosurgeon for hydrocephalus professionals monitor his kidney function orthopaedic needs and developmental progress it is not known how much mobility he will have in the future there are adopters willing to meet the challenge of bringing up children with complex needs but the advertisement goes on to say that the family needed for t must be able to develop a sense of ts ethnic and cultural identity and this is not simply about black children in the same magazine a white brother and sister with downs are featured but in this case again adopters should not take them on unless they can reflect or actively develop the ethnic and cultural identity of the two children thats what i mean when i talk sometimes about an obsession with ethnicity local authorities have been commendably brave in supporting the adoption of children by gay parents and they are right to do so because the evidence is clear that the disadvantage of a child growing up in a home where they are unlikely to share the sexuality of either of their parents is easily overcome the evidence that white parents can with sensitivity and support similarly compensate for a difference in ethnicity between themselves and an adopted child is just as compelling this bill will i hope ensure that social work practice responds to that reality,2013-02,child family bill first reading monday delivers government determination radically permanently reform adoption neglected abused child get stable loving home need im proud much bill

somewhere somehow the work to end violence against women lost momentum despite the improvements made over decades in tackling domestic and sexual violence the scale of the problem remains shocking repeat violence is worryingly high and there is a risk that we are taking progress for granted when much more could and should be done new freedom of information data from police forces reveals that up to a third of domestic incidents recorded by the police are repeat incidents that is the same victims calling for protection from the same perpetrators time and again opportunities to intervene and protect families are missed in the run up to valentines day on february the focus of the international campaign one billion rising to end violence against women there is more every one of us could do to reduce the insidious dangerous violence that still haunts too many womens lives complacency has been part of the problem campaigning by women in the s and s meant things such as domestic violence or rape within marriage were finally recognised as crimes in the s and noughties the government backed institutional change including more refuges courst to deal with domestic violence and police training as progress has been underway it has become easier to assume that everything possible was being done and we could all move on but the truth is much more disturbing the scale of violence remains hidden or taken for granted and the basics are still often missed first some facts two women a week are killed by a husband partner or ex in some areas one in five calls to the police each week are for domestic violence including those abused by parents or siblings and male victims although the majority are women one woman told me how she fitted a lock to a bedroom door and she sheltered with her children in a single room every night afraid of what her husband might do while they slept perhaps even more worrying the same families are calling for help again and again yet the emergency services can too often deal only with the immediate crisis and no serious followup action is taken many forces do not have a system for keeping track of repeat calls so cannot easily say who the most dangerous repeat perpetrators are the scale of government cuts to independent advisers specialist police teams and training risks making that much worse only of recorded domestic incidents end in successful prosecution only the highest risk victims get systematic help the figures for sexual violence are shocking too of the estimated half a million sexual offences each year only ever reach trial and there is some evidence that tolerance of violence in teenage relationships is growing according to the nspcc a third of teenagers in relationships have experienced violence the childrens commissioner estimates that young people mainly girls have been victims of gangrelated sexual violence but we dont have to stand for this for a start we need proper stronger action by police prosecutors local councils schools working with victims advisers to deal with the perpetrators help victims and improve safety that means we need proper national standards for public authorities on dealing with sexual and domestic violence some police forces and local councils do a great job working together indeed a couple of police forces are piloting early intervention schemes to identify and help those most at risk others fail learning from bodies such as the youth justice board we need a new national board to set standards and drive change second we should be doing more to prevent violence in the first place in particular that means changing attitudes among children and young people both boys and girls parents can do their bit but schools must too we need compulsory sex and relationship education in schools to include zero tolerance of violence in relationships parliament was part way through legislation to do that before the election but michael gove blocked it personally and he has resisted progress since on valentines day parliament will debate the need for that legislation again finally we need cultural change twitter users check out the timeline for everydaysexism or shoutingback and prepare to be shocked at the extent of continuing harassment and the threatened violence women report but prepare to be heartened too that so many women are shouting

racial and cultural differences can have a profound impact on ethnicminority children adopted by white parents according to new research that challenges the governments plans on adoption reform a study by the british association for adoption and fostering baaf examined the experiences of chinese orphans who arrived from hong kong in the s and were adopted by mainly white british parents the findings the first study into the longterm impact of interracial adoption in britain raise questions over the governments proposals to make it easier for prospective parents to adopt children from different racial or cultural backgrounds researchers questioned the former orphans on their experiences from childhood through to middle age reporting that common experiences included varying levels of racism prejudice and feelings of belonging and difference within their adoptive families and wider communities some of the women the threeyear baaf study found felt alienated struggled with conflicts of dualmultiple identities and had experienced racebased mistreatment childhood and adolescence were particularly traumatic for some with saying they felt uncomfortable following comments about how they looked different from their adoptive family while threequarters admitted thinking that they wanted to look less chinese for a minority it added racebased bullying and discrimination had a substantial negative impact on their wellbeing throughout the issue of ethnicity was cited by many of the former orphans as a potentially fraught issue whose impact was often linked to their adoptive familys sensitivity and openness to the issues of difference reforming the adoption process is one of the governments top priorities with education secretary michael gove hoping to end what he describes as the misguided belief that all children must be matched with parents of the same race campaigners said that a lack of research in the area meant that any new study was vital to help a better understanding of the effects of interracial adoption john simmonds director of policy research and development at the baaf said the findings suggested that the government would be wise to apply the brakes on any legislation he said if the government has the view that a child being adopted from a different country religion culture language is a marginal issue that becomes an irrelevance over the course of time given the benefits of adoption then that is not what this study has said professor alan rushton of kings college london said the government needs to take notice of these findings on the significance of ethnicity so that the wording of the proposed adoption legislation does not seem to downplay its importance there are broader concerns that the governments plans to dilute ethnicity as part of the adoption process might in part be guided by politics gove who was adopted at four months has accused social workers of condemning black and asian children to a life in care rather than see them adopted by white couples claiming leftwing prescriptions are denying children the love they need simmonds is among those worried that the intention to sideline race stems from david camerons criticism of state multiculturalism he said the emphasis is on being british that multiculturalism is dead it would be quite wrong to ignore these issues of difference and the way people experience difference in society the positive recognition of the importance of identity in a richer way julia feast the baafs policy research and development consultant said it was crucial that the evidence was analysed objectively they the government are basing it on adopters saying there are all these children languishing in care and rather than think about what research has been done in this country regarding the outcomes of transracial adoption they are going by the voice of prospective parents who think that love will be enough the research has been welcomed by a number of groups which say that although they welcome the governments attempts to speed up the adoption process downgrading the importance of ethnicity was a retrograde step ash chand of the nspcc said ethnicity culture language and religion help to fully form a childs identity these aspects of identity should be considered when matching suitable adoptive parents with children in care one positive outcome of the study was that the adopted orphans tended to become more comfortable with their chinese appearance as they matured researchers noted other positive patterns in comparison to other studies of both nonadopted and adopted women with the former hong kong orphans exhibiting good levels of mental and physical health educational achievement positive family lives and relationships with adoptive families the department for education said we are changing the law to ensure black and minority ethnic children who take on average a year longer to be adopted than white children are not left waiting

she remembers the isolation the confusion the racism the passersby who gawped at her because she looked different from her parents sue jardine said she felt neither chinese nor british a bloody foreigner in a country that didnt understand her my obvious difference to my family attracted unwanted attention and racist comments that i felt my parents did not understand or want to acknowledge she said jardine arrived at heathrow airport on september with four other girls from hong kong part of a group of about children mostly abandoned babies and mostly girls transported from the british colony to be adopted by uk families at the time with hong kong struggling to cope with an influx of refugees fleeing communist china the british government decided to transfer children from overcrowded orphanages to largely white british adopting families the british association for adoption and fostering spent three years tracking down and interviewing of them creating a detailed analysis of the effect of transracial adoption on individuals over years researchers say the study is unique providing the first glimpse into the longterm importance of ethnicity within adoption and into how issues of race and cultural identity manifest themselves during childhood and adolescence and into middleage although a spectrum of experiences was reported some positive the collective message was that race was critical to the girls wellbeing findings that challenge the governments proposal that ethnicity should not be a primary consideration for adoption agencies another of the hong kong orphans claire martin had a very different experience from jardine benefiting from being adopted by a mixedrace family an ethnically chinese britishborn father and a white british mother her adoptive parents experiences said martin meant they were deeply empathetic and grasped the potential problems of selfidentity and dealing with the assumptions of others yet playing down the importance of ethnicity in adoption was she said misguided i would not like the government to say that love is the most important thing i just dont believe thats the case there are enough of the women who have had really bad experiences even where people have genuinely loved them she said referring to the maslow scale the hierarchy of needs developed by the late us psychologist abraham maslow which stipulates that a persons fundamental requirements have to be fulfilled before they can realise their potential martin believes transracial adoption can fail to deliver much more than the basics they can give food shelter and all that stuff but when it gets to the higher end of peoples needs like confirming their identity selfimage they havent been able to fulfil that its really important the adoption process takes this into account and doesnt sweep race under the carpet she said similarly martin warned that good intentions are not enough most of the parents were largely middleclass white people with very good intentions and a lot of them very religious the intentions were great but the anecdotal recollections show there were quite a few who just didnt know it was like to be chinese she said jardine was among those who felt unable to relate to her adopting parents the lack of understanding or support of how i felt meant that i was unable to articulate my feelings she said jardine who rarely saw other chinese people while growing up in hertfordshire with white adoptive parents and their four children eventually turned to therapy to help overcome her sense of disconnection and isolation and moved to multicultural london to blend in some found genuine happiness jasmine gillies found herself in cambridgeshire with a family who fostered children from different nationalities and who had adopted a boy who was black the environment she said was inclusive and one where ethnic differences did not matter her mother diana davenport even wrote books on the virtues of transracial adoption gillies who lives in north london with a daughter said being raised in a very multinational family we never thought about being different from each other or about the colour of our skin or even where we came from my mother wanted to be us one big family it made me feel very relaxed and at ease she was staggered when she learned some of the other hong kong orphans had been miserable i was amazed at the different upbringing some of the other girls had with some saying they were picked on that they stood out in their very white anglican society most though believed that societys awareness and tolerance had improved in terms of the needs of adoptive families and how schools and workplaces tackled racism yet hostile attitudes towards mixedrace families clearly endure jardine said i still get racist comments in london and still hear adoption being used as a threat to children if they are not behaving martin who married a white british man with whom she has a mixedrace daughter also revealed her family suffered racist abuse describing an incident last year in crystal palace south london that was so bad her husband called the police we get hassle on the bus sometimes its just ridiculous she said many of those questioned for the study urged caution before encouraging transracial adoption stressing that it was vital the adopting parents could first prove they were capable of understanding issues arising from ethnicity jardine said transracial adoption should be a last resort ethnicity and cultural identity are defining factors in how we are perceived and perceive ourselves gillies a firm believer that transracial adoption works tried to adopt a child years ago informing social services in london that the childs nationality did not matter but they told me i can only adopt a child of my ethnic nationality i thought it was absolutely bizarre she said another recurring feature of the study was the resilience of the women with most overcoming any negativity associated with being interracially adopted by the time they reached middle age twenty years ago jardine wrote a poem that she still reads to remind herself how far she has travelled its third verse reads in this skin im called a bloody foreigner and told to go home an easy target for white and black just a quiet chinese whose stereotype is to please,2013-02,remembers isolation

in his speech on child poverty threequarters of local authorities to put up council tax for poorest families january the work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith described addiction as one important form of poverty this confuses one problem with another while fewer than of all adults are either problem drug or alcohol users and we dont know how many of these are poor or parents we do know that of children are living in poverty child poverty is the result of many problems low income being key the government has a legal duty to eradicate child poverty by latest estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands more children will be living in poverty by that date including more as a result of the real terms cuts in the benefits uprating bill that will reduce the income of disadvantaged families the government is consulting on how best to measure child poverty as end child poverty members we believe it would do better to look harder at how it can actually reduce child poverty now while helping those children who have parents who face addiction is a vital task it is not synonymous with tackling child poverty the government needs to recognise all of the elements that

the conservative mp liz truss like so many in public policy has noticed that childcare is unaffordable families in the uk spend nearly a third of their income on it more than anyone else in the world truss is unique i think in identifying the problem as overregulation specifically she thinks the current adulttochild ratios are too stringent in her plan one adult would be able to care for six twoyearolds at the moment its four this would force up wages apparently and professionalise the role of childcare which process incidentally would be shored up by new requirements including c grades in maths and english gcses opinion gathered along party lines rightwing thinktanks and blogs hailed this as trusss moment lefties said she was barking ah the smell of napisan in the morning i love it but did anybody testdrive her theory for her even in its planning stage i do not think they did so in the interests of public policy research i scored myself six toddlers between am and pm these are not standard nursery hours so i cannot vouch for the poor humans who would have to do this professionally i should note here that i dont have any childcare qualifications though i do have maths and english gcses and am educated to degree level that didnt help sid and sam are twins lucas and ryan are good pals harper is my daughter and is actually three and gus rounded it up ryan was the godsend of the group fascinated by the taxonomy of the pixar cars franchise he made precisely no demands apart from wheres the red one wheres the blue one wheres sally and batteries he was also potty trained along with lucas who is a charmer the twins were in nappies gus was not in a good mood basically the ryan of a gang this size will get precisely no attention at all he will just occasionally be handed a car that might be fine he might be a miniversion of those adults who like to read poetry at parties but its not very ofsted i think they would want him to have some interaction on the subject of ofsted they require a carer to take the kids out at least once a day i want to make a complicated analogy about a horde of ferrets and a motorway but actually anybody who thinks an adult could take out six twoyearold children has simply never met a preverbal child it would be the apex of irresponsibility people would stop you in the street i couldnt even get them all into the same room at the same time guss mood was not bad he just wasnt feeling very vivacious and wanted to be in someones arms the whole time its incredibly cute like having a marmoset but now i have no arms to look after the other five they didnt fight with each other i think they knew on some instinctive level that i wouldnt be able to intervene i was effectively the un all blue helmet and no mandate the twins are in that callandresponse phase where they show you something and tell you what it is but they wont really rest until you show them something else tell them what that is and then you swap its not timeconsuming so much as concentrationbreaking so you can never follow through on what youre doing and what youre normally doing is looking for the child you cant immediately see quite often that child will show up in the time it takes you to remember that you were looking for him but not always so there is a hell of a lot of running up and down stairs and blind panic i wasnt going to admit that because i thought their mothers would freak out but now ive given them all back alive i figure its ok and because shes three and wont choke i didnt take any notice of my daughter at all for all i know she took off and spent the time in caff nero longterm or rather for any period longer than three hours you would basically have to pen them into a smaller space otherwise you would go mad thats fine its not dangerous but again its not very ofsted you cant keep kids in a single room for a whole day with no fresh air those are battery conditions twins poo at the same time who knew but you have to prioritise the toddlers who are using a loo as they seem to have some autosuggestion and need to go as soon as they smell anything that reminds them of a loo building in some time to lose track of what you were doing id put this job at an hour from pooalert to the second twin getting a fresh nappy i dont even know where ofsted stands on this but i dont think they would give me a medal i want to

is it time to dispel the urban myth of unwitting feminists the women who decline to call themselves feminist but are nevertheless labelled feminist by other people usually natch feminists women who are actually pretty rude about feminists but who can nevertheless end up declared feminist in deed if not intent a little while ago the great british bake off star mary berry gave an interview stating that feminism was a dirty word she loved having her coat fetched for her and feminism was just shouting at men when you should persuade them gently to do things a quite brilliant and thorough representation of feminism we all disagreed now joan bakewell has responded that she feels that berry would probably have led a quiet unchanging rural life while a woman like herself whizzed about in a more rackety existence so feminism mattered a lot more to her bakewell also said berry would doubtless expect to be paid a decent wage for the job she does and she would probably expect to be paid as much as a man so to that extent she is a feminist without realising it funny isnt it how it takes a feminist to be gracious about a nonfeminist certainly its interesting to observe berry being derogatory and ill informed about feminism dirty word shouting at men mary you havent got the manners you were born with by contrast bakewell makes an effort to understand berrys viewpoint pointing out her achievements and even garlanding berry with a covert feminist mindset some might say ill becomes her and when i say some people i mean berry herself why do so many feminists do this why do they feel the urge to make a claim on women who have quite baldly stated they want nothing to do with them that indeed they oppose everything they stand for is it a bizarre form of feminist selfhatred neediness or a strain of delusion even arrogance that woman is a feminist but shes too thick to realise it and she needs me to let her know is it about tribalism a yearning for inclusivity whats certain is that nonfeminists arent like this they dont tend go about randomly claiming feminists as secretly one of them you dont tend to see women such as mary berry remarking you know that joan bakewell is a nonfeminist without even realising it however feminists do it rather a lot im a repeat offender but im starting to realise how strange it is heres an idea if someone states that theyre not a feminist just let them say oh blah and wave them off whatever their achievements and berrys are vast theyre clearly not feminist if they think so little of feminism however feminist they might behave careers ambition mysterious refusals to give up baking empires to wait patiently at home for a man to fetch their coat for them they cant be labelled feminist if it has to be forced on them it could even be argued that claiming women such as berry as unwitting feminists is letting them off a very large and scratchy ethical hook indeed while a much younger female could just about get away with not understanding what feminism means youd have thought that berry would have lived through or at least alongside enough feminism not to be quite this blinkered dismissive and unappreciative thats why past a certain age there is no such thing as an unwitting feminist just rather rude ungrateful women who should know better instead of politely arguing with them and earnestly pointing out their feminist sensibilities perhaps the only useful response is to be just as weird and rude back so here we go mary if youre such an antifeminist what on earth are you doing excelling at a brilliant career dont you have some ironing to do even boris doesnt deserve darius poor boris johnson first hes hit by the mair missile youre a nasty piece of work then comes the darius doodlebug johnsons schoolfriend and bullingdon mucker darius guppy leapt to johnsons defence in the spectatorcorrect though i use the word defence loosely amid his exhilarating philosophical musings guppy seems unrepentant regarding the infamous tape of him asking boris for a journalists details saying he only regretted not giving the hack in question a hiding you let it all hang out guppy dont mind us guppy opines that journalists are liars but so are politicians following this by asserting that many important historical characters have been nasty pieces of work the rationale presumably being is there room for a cuddly blond one throughout guppy drolly intones mr mair in a way that makes you wonder does he want to punch him or fag for him there are other good bits oh why pretend its all good bits a fine piece of comedy writing in fairness theres also vigorous condemnation of johnsons ritual humiliation of his wife and family nice one gups and rather more wistful allusions to god than youd expect from a convicted insurance fraudster the effect is somewhat revealing especially for johnson whose amiable bumbler act has gone into such dire freefall that only the ironic student vote could save him now boris must have been tearing out those flaxen locks desperate for guppy to stop defending him hed doubtless try to strangle him with the old school tie if he could just think all that boris misery david cameron has been through and all he ever had to do was defend him guppystyle a textbook case of with friends like darius guppy who needs enemies like eddie mair lily do put your clothes back on

the sexual assault and murder of meredith kercher in perugia in was a dreadful crime the perpetrator rudy guede left copious amounts of forensic evidence at the scene and is currently serving a prison sentence in normal circumstances guedes conviction would have been the end of the matter but these are not normal circumstances the announcement that amanda knox and her italian exboyfriend raffaele sollecito are to face a retrial means a fourth set of proceedings no doubt with worldwide publicity it also confirms the reluctance of the italian authorities to let go of a misogynist fantasy which has turned the case into a prolonged media circus to anyone familiar with the modus operandi of sex attackers the identification of guede as the killer is unproblematic he knew knox and kercher by sight he had visited the young men who lived in the apartment below theirs and it is entirely credible that he knocked on the door or broke into the upper flat in the hope of having sex with one of the women he left a partial palm print on a pillow in kerchers room a footprint matched the trainers he was wearing and his dna was found on the body and at various locations in the apartment he opted for a fasttrack court procedure in and was sentenced to years in prison reduced to on appeal the central mystery of this case is not the identity of the murderer but the steely determination of the italian authorities to drag in two other suspects knox and sollecito at their original trial in the prosecution was able to produce neither witnesses nor a credible motive knoxs confession was obtained when she was sleepdeprived had no access to lawyers and was unable to speak fluent italian she retracted it as soon as she was allowed to sleep and get legal advice the two students eventual conviction rested on minute traces of forensic evidence and even that was comprehensively discredited during their successful appeal in theres no doubt that their release infuriated prosecutors in perugia who had convinced themselves that knox was a villainous character who could easily have walked out of a medieval witch trial its impossible to overstate the influence on knoxs trials of perugias dark history which has earned it a reputation as an epicentre of medieval witch burnings its left a residue of superstition and fear of female sexuality which emerged time after time in court with one lawyer actually accusing knox of being diabolic in a country where catholicism still informs conservative attitudes towards female sexuality and silvio berlusconis tv channels present young women as writhing sex objects there is little space for independent modern women knox was transformed from a typical american student into a sexcrazed hedonist who arrived with from the us with a vibrator in her luggage within weeks she supposedly conceived such a hatred of her british flatmate that she persuaded two men she barely knew to take part in a murderous attack improbable as all this

david camerons highprofile free parenting classes scheme is in meltdown figures show that only of eligible families have taken up the offer of help a poor takeup of vouchers worth of advice has led to one provider pulling out while a second has told the observer that a lack of sustained publicity has hit numbers the prime minister launched free classes for parents of underfives last may to great fanfare offering a boost to parents as nationbuilders in the wake of the riots in england families in four trial areas bristol camden in london high peak in derbyshire and middlesbrough could get vouchers from boots stores and health workers however an assessment published last week found only of eligible parents took up classes in the first seven months of those that did start the course which typically lasts three to four weeks one in five pulled out early concerns were also raised by local authorities about the quality of some of the courses run by the firms and charities selected by the department for education the trial known as canparent aimed to reach fathers as well as mothers but after seven months of those attending were female the revelations will be a major embarrassment for cameron in a week in which his childcare proposals have also been savaged the coalition is desperate to been seen as family friendly and to attract female support last week he personally launched a taxfree voucher scheme for parents to help them pay for up to of childcare a year per child however the flagship proposal was savaged for only being available to families with two earners and discriminating against stay at home mothers on sunday the resolution foundation thinktank reveals analysis showing that the new childcare support is heavily weighted in favour of betteroff families it has found that only families in the bottom of the income distribution will qualify for help compared to million in the top largely because those earning under are not eligible for help the government has put an additional m into universal credit to help the less welloff but vidhya alakeson deputy chief executive of the foundation said too many of the working poor had been excluded this week the government announced new plans to reduce the burden of childcare costs on families as part of that it is very welcome that some families receiving universal credit will in the future see their childcare costs halved but it is wrong for the new proposal to exclude many of the poorest working families who struggle greatly with the cost of childcare as part of the governments

katja heger the mother of threeyearold antony nodded in the direction of the happy child nursery in ealing west london on a cold morning i earn a month and of it goes here she said im just looking forward to september when he goes to school and its free because at the moment im working just to cover childcare it is the plight of heger who works in a beauty salon and many hundreds of thousands of parents like her that has made childcare the hot political issue of the moment at the nursery gates and during parents evening last monday it wasnt talk of the tax cut for millionaires as labour describes the toprate income tax change set for april that dominated proceedings according to christine odonovan the senior nursery manager nor was david camerons position on the new regulatory regime for the press the conversational topic of choice that is only so much political noise said the parents as they dropped off their children on friday the overriding concern for the majority of the million families in the uk if the clientele of the happy child nursery is anything to go by is providing highquality care for their children and the drain on their bank accounts necessitated by paying for it that is why labour talks of learning from scandinavia and has set up a commission to offer ideas and it certainly lies behind george osbornes decision to mention children times in his budget speech on wednesday yet as the deputy prime minister nick clegg who was answering calls on a london radio station discovered last week it is an extraordinarily difficult political issue to get right hi im just wondering why the coalition is discriminating against mothers like me who care for their children at home said laura from east dulwich there is absolutely no provision within the tax system to help families like myself and our family is no doubt a net contributor to the exchequer i just feel that this provision is to bump up the gdp numbers because if i was looking after someone elses children that would count as a gdp number which is all that i think the treasury care about they know the price of everything and the value of nothing the irate yearold mother of two was referring to the central policy among the flurry of childcare announcements made last week and one to which in the fine tradition of tony blair the prime minister was keen to be personally connected too many families find paying for childcare tough and are often stopped from working the hours theyd like said cameron while visiting a nursery in south london on tuesday that is why we are introducing taxfree childcare saving a typical family with two children up to a year this is a boost direct to the pockets of hardworking families in what will be one of the biggest measures ever introduced to help parents with childcare costs cue to the treasurys dismay the inevitable unravelling the hard working families referred to by the prime minister didnt include families where one of the parents stayed at home to look after the children it soon transpired parents were only eligible to benefit from the handout of per child childcare voucher if they both worked and as the resolution foundation thinktanks first comprehensive analysis of the childcare funding plan announced reveals it didnt include the countrys poorest either only families in the bottom of the income distribution will qualify for new help compared with million in the top of those families who are eligible for the taxfree childcare voucher four out of five are in the top of the income distribution just in the bottom of the income distribution will be eligible for the vouchers why because hardworking also appears to be defined as earning more than each and therefore paying income tax extra money on the insistence of the liberal democrats was also announced for people on the new universal credit catchall benefit to give them help but again working families will miss out because they do not earn enough to pay income tax usually because one or both parents is in lowpaid parttime work and there indeed is the rub politicians across the political spectrum love to talk about hardworking families the vast majority of people believe they are in one of those but when it comes to policy the prime minister has been in the difficult position of having to actually define that most cliched of terms he has had to pick out winners and losers and the losers and their backers from both the left and the right arent very happy kathy gyngell a former television producer who is now a research fellow at the rightleaning thinktank the centre for policy studies said its the demise of the family all of the government support goes in one direction it depends on you following the choice the government wants you to follow to go back to work and you get rewarded for that i am not saying childcare is cheap and i am not saying that it doesnt cause women a problem but this is completely inequitable in terms of womens choices they are fundamentally saying the mother at home is useless and a worthless person they are saying a mothers worth is only her economic worth that she would be better doing a bad job looking after other peoples children in a nursery than bringing up her own children at home there is very little that is tory about this government from the other side of the spectrum enver solomon chairman of the end child poverty campaign said that he was equally dismayed he could not understand the scant regard for those he believed should have been targeted with the cash with lowincome families under massive financial strain and the government committed to ending child poverty by the budget represented a major opportunity for action to drive down child poverty and put food on the table of the poorest families he said instead the measures announced appear to do nothing for children in poverty it is as if the budget has nothing to do with them this raises serious concerns that despite the governments social justice rhetoric the reality is that child poverty is a blindspot in the treasurys agenda but being prime minister is nothing if it isnt about making choices ryan shorthouse a researcher at the rightleaning social market foundation thinktank said that he believed that cameron was looking for leaders for growth and female employment generally is associated with higher economic growth the prime minister has decided who will be the engines of growth and it appears to be largely women earning well but not well enough who in time will fill britains boardrooms with fresh ideas and energy it is the sort of women that liz truss his energetic minister for children a former commercial manager for shell and member of the rightwing free enterprise group of tories has long been a champion the question now is whether the women dropping off children at the happy child nurseries and its likes will deliver and whether more time in work proves the right priority for mothers like katya heger and her friends,2013-03,katja heger mother threeyearold antony nodded direction happy child nursery ealing west london cold morning earn month go said im looking forward

the governments decision to spend nearly bn on childcare in the budget is welcome with some of the most expensive childcare in the world making work pay after childcare costs is a real challenge for many parents but the governments claim to be offering universal support ignores the fact that welloff families on up to will be entitled to help under last weeks proposals while some of the poorest working families dont receive any new support this does not meet any commonly understood definition of universality under the governments proposals a new taxfree childcare voucher worth up to per child will be available to families who are not eligible for universal credit as long as all parents in the household work this is a clear improvement on the lottery of the current childcare voucher system which is only available to those whose employers choose to offer it universal credit will cover almost half of all families with children overwhelmingly those on low to middle incomes this means that the voucher will largely be for betteroff parents in fact of families who will be eligible for the voucher are in the top half of the income distribution and threequarters of the new money available for childcare will go to them only the very richest will be excluded for some families in the bottom half extra support was also announced in the form of an improvement to the universal credit instead of claiming back of their childcare costs families in which both parents work and earn enough to pay income tax will be able to claim back of their costs this will be a major improvement it will halve childcare costs for up to families however most of the beneficiaries will be middleincome by contrast of the poorest working families on universal credit will miss out on this extra childcare support because they include someone who does not earn enough to pay income tax mainly parttime workers on low pay a fifth of these families will be better off under universal credit because they will be entitled to the basic level of childcare support that under todays working tax credit only goes to those working more than hours thats good news however almost half of families with children in universal credit will miss out entirely on any new childcare support and these are the very families for whom childcare presents the biggest barrier to work under todays system a second earner receiving the minimum wage with a partner also on low pay is only better off a week if he or she works hours rather than not at all increasing childcare support to would help make work pay but under the current proposals these families will be excluded thats an extraordinary decision the overall result of these changes is a complex threetier system an improved voucher system for largely betteroff families a more generous tax credit system for families with two earners both paying tax but no improvement for many of the poorest working families the government intends to consult on its childcare proposals before they are introduced in this provides opportunity to rethink the targeting of support under universal credit new money should be found or taken from the voucher scheme aimed at the better off to ensure that work also pays for low earners who work parttime theyve been overlooked the government can and must put this right the author is deputy chief

a delightful young barrister laura perrins and her barrister husband have a baby girl annabelle followed by a boy matthew laura decides she would prefer to leave work rather than use childcare and becomes a stayathome parent we would never have known about this excellent arrangement of course if the coalition government had not tainted the young familys happiness by offering new childcare subsidies to working parents who need to pay for childcare perhaps even more unhappy were the section of working parents who currently claim vouchers who realised that these subsidies would leave them frighteningly worse off even given this governments speciality of helping the already rich the childcare proposals are strikingly unfair extending the new tax breaks to couples earning up to at the same that time that they penalise parents who have already lost child benefit but it was laura the martyr of east dulwich whom traditionalists appointed chief victim of the changes the poster girl for affluent stayathome mothers until the arrival of mrs perrins the campaign to depict the governments astonishingly illthoughtout childcare subsidies for working parents as primarily an insult or slur on an entirely different set of people one that includes the childless and dog owners as well as stayathome parents had been presented of necessity by working journalists an early daily mail counterattack the scientific proof that forcing mothers out to work harms children proclaiming their need for motherly joy and love was written by bel mooney the agony aunt columnist and broadcaster if emotion words such as joy and anger are diminishing in english novels according to a new study they continue to be essential in daily mail articles designed to set women on women duly enraged mrs perrins telephoned mr cleggs radio phonein why she wanted to know would she and mr perrins not be getting any of the childcare cash im just wondering she began why the coalition is discriminating against mothers like me who care for their children at home she was doing she said a difficult job perhaps mr clegg should not do radio phoneins although in fairness his fellow presenter a professional seemed equally incurious about what the perrinses wanted their missing childcare money for since they would not be spending it on childcare a labradoodle garden furniture unusual cheeses can we expect any receipts do the couple feel similarly covetous of those allowable hmrc expenses such as plant and tools or membership of a professional body which are also insultingly denied to stayathome mothers but cleggs immediate response to mrs perrinss demand that his government subsidise the lifestyle of highrate taxpayers was i like everybody massively admire your choice and you should be entirely free and proud of the choices you make in your own life leaving for another day the question of admiration since only a barrister can really know how much pain is incurred when legal drudgery is sacrificed for the cut and thrust of baby pilates it was mr cleggs shared belief with laura perrins that choice is involved in the average working parents lives that was most unworthy thousands more mothers would look after their small children if they could afford it equally thousands of others would go out to work if only they could find the childcare and the unemployment and divorce figures suggest that even those privileged parents like mrs perrins for whom living the postwar dream actually is a choice might want to think quite hard before making themselves wholly economically dependent on another person who may one day tire of providing although perhaps that is where government help for stayathomers comes in as entertaining as their engagements are to watch one thinks of cherie blair v all working mothers the animosity between stayathome and working parents seems mercifully to be waning thanks to reforms in maternity leave and flexible working along with the increase in twoincome families the differences are now more blurred so much so that sometimes you cant even spot the difference and not only because the sharp suits in which harassedlooking models used to pose with babies and bottles are no longer on trend many of us have now had the chance to be condescended to by colleagues with wholly devolved childcare as well as guilttripped by career mothers who call paid carers strangers and consider a good mothers fulltime devotions essential until gcses or beyond by which time a needy dog may have also been recruited to the arguments for domestic presenteeism calls for peace and reconciliation between the two camps predominate over battle cries albeit most of them seem to come from homebased journalists who are lucky enough to balance column production with the creation of witty world book day costumes it can never further harmony however that anyone who has done a stint of fulltime childcaring on a reasonable income will know exactly what a privileged sah mother means by a difficult job in a home equipped with laboursaving devices once a biddable child is over three some savage new posts on parenting websites show how easy it is to ignite the usually latent hostility between working mothers who wish whatever their views on the sexual politics that they had that kind of time to spend with their children and stayathomers who wish they had some respect in response to the great government robbery mrs perrins has apparently signed up to a body called mothers at home matter whose mission is to promote understanding of the childs need for a mother at home and its point is so long as sah campaigners ignoring studies on working mothers that find a neutral effect on children believe that the only good mother is an omnipresent one we can never entirely get along a bigger problem for mothers at home matter is promulgating its cause in a country where so few girls grow up to be senior politicians yet in which thanks to the curse of aspiration even the leaders wives flagrantly ignore the childs need for a mother at home how to get more people fighting for the right to invisibility for government help in retiring permanently from the job market maybe a petition or a womens delegation could work but fronted by public figures such as oliver james and paul dacre thus ensuring that no playdates are damaged in the process but although last weeks reporting suggested that a huge number of stayathome mothers are betrayed by the governments snub to the s family the ratio of working to sah mothers means the great majority of working parents will be more preoccupied with its continued failure to help ordinary families pay for some of the most costly childcare in europe you dont

ministers plans to reduce the importance of income in measuring child poverty are today sharply criticised by their own official adviser on child poverty alan milburn the exlabour minister turned coalition adviser calls on the government to rethink its plans and even start on a fresh consultation saying its current proposals are muddled and unclear ministers are committed by law to try to abolish by child poverty measured by the number of children living in households below of median income the government is consulting on proposals to introduce a suite of other measures designed to reflect the deeper causes of poverty including the quality of school education and the stability of family relationships in its formal submission to the government consultation milburns social mobility and child poverty commission says it looks to the government to make a clear commitment to maintain the centrality of income in measuring poverty and to clarify its position on the targets enshrined in the child poverty act it adds it now seems vanishingly unlikely sic that this government will hit the targets in the child poverty act milburns commissions submission insists that the government should not abandon the target it the current measures enshrined in the child poverty actsays the provide clear accountability and facilitate international comparisons the relative poverty measurement is regarded globally as a critical means of benchmarking developed countries performance milburn also urges the government to rethink its whole child poverty strategy saying without clarity about how the government intends to meet the targets however it risks a repeat of what it has rightly criticised the previous administration for an approach to meeting child poverty commitments that was incremental rather than being informed by a clear longterm plan ministers both conservative and liberal democrat have criticised the relative income measure saying it leads to a targeting of tax credits to help income groups close to the abitrary officially defined poverty line rather than dealing with the fundamental issues of the cause of child poverty milburn citing research by the institute for fiscal studies rejects this claim saying the evidence shows that on the contrary the reduction in child poverty was very similar for all poverty lines between and of median household incomes milburn was appointed chair of the social mobility and child poverty commission by david cameron he was a key blairite in the labour government and his rejection of the coalitions plans will be embarrassing for a government that likes to cite blairite endorsements for its policies the submission says the choice of poverty measure is not a technocratic decision it is partly driven by the fundamental assumptions that are made about poverty milburn claims the governments proposals conflate the causes and the consequences of poverty in a way that is likely to be confusing factors like poor parental skills or family stability are distinct from the lived experience of poverty which includes factors like low income material deprivation poor housing and debt the submission says having parents with low education is not in our view however part of the experience of poverty because it does not in itself affect childrens current standards of living apart from through its potential effect on income the commission does suggest some changes to the proposed supplementary targets for example that poverty measures should count benefits in kind such as housing and childcare where perversely spending does not necessarily show up in reducedincome poverty even if it is saving poor families money he also suggests that ministers look at measuring the depth of poverty saying the current severe poverty measure could be strengthened this article was amended on march to clarify that ministers are committed by law to try to abolish by child poverty measured by the number of children living in households below of median income,2013-03,minister plan reduce importance income measuring child poverty today sharply criticised official adviser child poverty alan

more than half of working families on the lowest incomes will not qualify for the new more generous financial support for childcare announced by the chancellor in his budget on wednesday in one of the first examples of a key budget measure unravelling the resolution foundation thinktank has calculated that nearly million families at the bottom of the income scale will not be able to claim the extra help under the measure because one or both parents earn too little to pay income tax although these households will still claim financial support at a lower level the decision means they are not eligible for extra help of up to a week for one child and a week for two children that will be available to people on higher incomes the scheme for lower earners on universal credit is separate from one aimed at people earning between and that provides up to of support for childcare per child the government should be applauded for attempting to help families struggling with the costs of childcare but the truth is that those who are struggling the most are missing out said vidhya alakeson resolution foundations deputy chief executive the two childcare schemes briefed to newspapers before the budget are part of the governments drive to focus on what they call aspiration part of a looming election battleground with labour over which party would do more to help hardworking families both improved childcare schemes are due to come into force in autumn the scheme for families on universal credit being introduced this year to bring together key benefits and tax credits under a single payment will extend the refund of childcare costs available to households from currently to for families in which both adults pay income tax up to a maximum of a week of childcare bills for two children however resolution foundation calculates that families with children under will not qualify for the higher rebate because one or both parents earn too little to pay income tax ironically a tally that will increase next year when the government raises the income tax threshold to of these households have children under five although the families can still claim the refund it was still completely wrong that most needy families could not claim the higher rate said alakeson a treasury source said the government has already taken to steps to help those working part time by removing the minimum hours rule in universal credit weve also increased the free entitlement to hours for all three and fouryearolds and by and twoyearolds the most disadvantaged will also receive hours free

britains poorest families have been abandoned on the frontline of austerity say campaigners who claim the budget has failed to change the fact that more children will move into poverty during the coalitions time in office the chancellor described it as a budget for families with children looking to work hard and aspiring to get on said alison garnham chief executive of child poverty action group cpag but most lowincome families have very few reasons to be cheerful and plenty to be fearful raising the personal tax allowance from to next month and to from april does little for the million lowest paid workers garner argued some dont pay tax anyway while others keep just p in every extra because their inwork benefits like housing benefit get withdrawn she said the new package of childcare support for working families due to be introduced from autumn after the next general election will also do little for struggling lowpaid parents the package includes cover of up to of childcare costs for parents receiving support through tax credits but will only be offered where a lone parent or both earners in a couple earn enough to pay income tax leaving lower earners out it will also provide childcare support of per child for families not on tax credits or state benefits where both parents earn up to its a great disappointment for struggling families that the majority of extra funds for childcare will be going to the wealthiest families garnham said the real challenge is to make childcare affordable for those at the bottom end so there are strong incentives for second earners and single parents to work that would do much more to help reduce child poverty and would help economic recovery too fiona weir chief executive of single parent charity gingerbread said while we welcome the governments investment in childcare feels like a very long time to wait for lowincome single parent families who may not have a car a house deposit or a fondness for beer but who are struggling to pay their bills and put food on the table today previously announced plans for welfare benefits rubberstamped by the chancellor to take effect from april will add to the pressure on lowincome families and push more children into poverty say campaigners for the next three tax years starting this april most key benefits and tax credits will rise by just a year below projected inflation and amounting to a real terms cut while some have been frozen altogether this will directly push children into poverty over the period according to the governments own analysis say campaigners child benefit rates have been frozen for a third year running at per week for the first child and for each subsequent child until january this was a universal benefit paid at the same rate to all families with children regardless of income but since january it is not paid to families where one earner earns above and is recovered on a sliding scale via income tax where one earner earns key elements of tax credits will not rise at all in the coming tax year including the basic element of the working tax credit wtc which stays at and the family element of the child tax credit ctc stuck at from april the child element of ctc rises by a year p a week to and the disabled child element goes up by to a year the severely disabled child element rises by to the maximum that claimants can be paid for the childcare element of wtc is frozen for the coming tax year currently this pays up to of childcare costs provided by a registered childminder nursery outofschool club or other

the weekly limit for two or more children is and the maximum claim both tax credits and most main meanstested benefits will eventually be replaced by a single universal credit payment for those of

not entitled to call myself a fulltime parent im a parttime parent because i leave the house at am even the treasury briefing supporting the budgets new childcare vouchers scheme for families where two parents work distinguished parents who look after their children fulltime from those like me this is nonsense theres not a moment when im not parenting im a mother i dont worry about my childrens welfare every now and then i dont clock on to motherhood when i return in time for the channel news if a nonworking mothers children go on a playdate or attend a bongo bongo toddlers music club that

paid to enable my children to have a reasonable standard of living i spend a morning sitting at my desk scribbling so my daughter can go on the school trip to france im not saying looking after children isnt hard work it is but lurking behind the misconception that in order to be a fulltime parent you cant go out to work lies a very oldfashioned antifeminist notion we mothers just do the feelings we concentrate on the nurturing we gurgle at our babies tickle their chins take them to playgroup and ensure they develop into rounded human beings in this division of labour a mother has no responsibility for their childrens economic wellbeing its their loving care she has to worry about thats just as ridiculous as saying a father has no responsibility for their childrens emotional wellbeing you cant pick and choose which part of being a parent you want to be lets be honest when we talk about fulltime parents we mostly mean middleclass mothers with supporting partners in current debates the language is one of choice women who choose not to work these mothers are mainly women who can afford to stay at home thats a luxury for many women it isnt a choice at all some have to work not simply to send their kids on school trips but to survive others cant afford to work because their income wouldnt cover the spiralling cost of childcare single parents are particularly vulnerable to this childcare catch but its an odd argument that moves from supporting lowincome parents who dont have choice to subsidising those who choose not to work even though they could and then saying

for the latest political fallout and rolling budget coverage change the channel over to our budget day live blog helmed by the esteemed andrew sparrow and graeme wearden find out how you and your family will fair over on our live budget clinic get instant analysis and reaction from the guardians economics editor larry elliott gingerbread a charity that offers advice and support to single parents says the prebudget announcement on increased childcare help does not begin to mitigate the devastating cuts to the welfare safety net the charitys chief executive fiona weir said while we welcome the governments investment in childcare feels like a very long time to wait for low income single parent families who may not have a car a five per cent house deposit or a fondness for beer but who are struggling to pay their bills and put food on the table today despite very little being said on welfare in todays budget within two weeks the devastating welfare cuts announced by the chancellor in december will begin to bite these are cuts that will push more children into poverty added to these cuts the hancellors oblique reference today to capping areas of welfare spending is deeply concerning this threatens further pain for families who have already borne the brunt of welfare cuts we will be looking to the spending review for measures to support not punish those on low incomes environmental charity wwfuk agrees the budget was a death knell for clean green technologies this chancellors budget was remarkable in two respects first in its overlooking one of the strongestgrowing sector of the economy namely the green economy and secondly in its determination to extend yet more tax breaks to the fossil fuel sector with the annual growth rate for the green economy standing at around five per cent its simply amazing the chancellor shouldnt be more vocal in supporting it the prime minister himself has said that the countries that will win the global race in the future economy are the ones that will embrace new clean green technologies like renewables and energy efficiency handing yet more subsidies to nuclear and tax breaks to fossil fuels the technologies of yesterday whilst ignoring the technologies of tomorrow is not the way to do this the chancellor seems to be fixated on backing the wrong horses experts in the uks energy sector say the chancellors budget signals a marked shift away from renewables undermining the governments already shaky footing as the selfstyled greenest ever nathan goode partner and head of energy environment and sustainability at grant thornton uk llp said the budget statement confirms that the current focus of this governments energy investment strategy is perpetuating the use of fossil fuels rather than investing further in alternatives with measures to support shale gas exploration and the development of two carbon capture and storage projects it also reinforces a determination to proceed with new nuclear and with the chancellors reiteration of the hinckley point planning consent announced yesterday it seems to be a matter of when not if the strike price will be agreed with edf energy these may be appropriate decisions in a mixed energy strategy but the absence of any reference to renewables in the chancellors speech will be interpreted as a deprioritisation of this sector many will also question the appropriateness of subsidising nonstandard fossil fuel exploration alongside the cancellation of the fuel duty allowance the national association of pension funds is happy osborne has brought forward the introduction of the new flatrate state pension with the slight caveat that company pension schemes should be protected from any knockon effects joanne segars chief executive of the napf said we strongly welcome proposals for a new single tier state pension but the government has to ensure that the changes are implemented in a way that does not damage company pension schemes this is a very tight timeframe and we question whether it can be delivered schemes need flexibility and time to adapt if the government gets it wrong then it risks sparking a fresh round of final salary pension closures in the private sector businesses that get caught on the wrong side of these changes will lose a significant rebate from the end of contracting out and this extra cost may prompt them to close their pensions altogether we have waited many years for these reforms an overhaul of the state pension is long overdue and a simpler fairer system helps set a clear foundation on which people can build their own savings it would be a shame if mistakes were made in a rush to implement the changes no such kind words from thinktanks based north of the watford gap osbornes measures will do more to further inflate house prices and childcare costs in london and very little to boost regional development says ed cox director of ippr north he said george osborne has missed an opportunity today to enable the north to play its part in leading us out of our economic stagnation in the light of the positive response of the government to the heseltine report on monday we would have liked to have seen a greater shift of emphasis today towards rebalancing the economy of the uk with a greater degree of urgency today the chancellor could have freed up our economy to enable the north to play a more significant role in driving growth the federation of small businesses could hardly be more effusive about todays budget saying the chancellors measures went beyond even what they had hoped for john walker the fsbs national chairman said the fsb asked for a budget for small businesses and this is what has been delivered this budget opens the door for small firms to grow and create jobs the chancellor has pulled out all the stops with a wideranging package of measures to support small firms fsb says the housing initiative will help reinvigorate the construction sector in which many of our members operate and where confidence has been low the national insurance contributions nics cut goes beyond what we were asking for and we are pleased to see the p fuel duty rise due in september completely scrapped we now look forward to hearing details on how the government intends to take forward the business bank that will help provide much needed access to capital for small firms airlines will be disappointed there was no reduction in the tax paid on air travel currently per shorthaul flight from the uk daniel barlow an indirect tax partner in the travel hospitality and travel practice at deloitte said the levy does not help the uks competitiveness the government is committed to retaining air passenger duty apd probably for the simple reason that it raises billion of revenue per year and only costs pence to collect for every raised however the debate on apd is more complex the aviation industry has put forward arguments that the tax does not help the uks competitiveness given that the majority of eu member states do not have a similar tax furthermore there are areas where apd causes distortions of competition and requires reform for example a passenger flying from belfast to alicante will pay apd if they fly direct however they are likely to pay apd if they make the same journey but book two connecting flights through london with budget airlines the same passenger will pay irish air travel tax apd if they go over the border and catch their flight to alicante from dublin if the government is set on retaining apd its likely that the industry will focus on ending these types of market distortion the fmb worries that the measures announced today may not go far enough to allow smaller builders to deliver the energyefficent new homes britain needs brian berry the fmbs chief executive said we needed a budget for housing to address the acute shortage of affordable energyefficient homes in the uk the help to buy package is aimed at stimulating the underperfroming mortgage market which could provide a boost to all firms involved in house building renovation and repair but changes to the firstbuy scheme will be of limited assistance if it remains too costly and complex for smaller developers who deliver a third of all new homes britains sme builders are in need of relief after years of shrinking workloads and rising costs more than threequarters of our members recently told us that the most important thing the government could do to revitalise the home repair maintenance and energyefficiency markets would be to cut vat this would also provide a level playing field when competing with builders who choose to avoid charging vat the antipoverty charity war on want calls the chancellors deal with crown dependencies promising but warns that is does not go far enough to clamp down on routine tax avoidance calling it a hollow pr stunt tax justice campaigner murray worthy said osbornes announcement of a new antiabuse rule at the heart of his supposed tax avoidance clampdown is nothing more than a hollow pr stunt an administrative exercise for hmrc tinkering around the edges of what is legal is being dressed up as an assault on tax dodgers not only will these plans have no impact on giant corporate tax dodgers they actually stand to make things worse by the governments own figures this new measure will only bring in tens of millions in lost revenue every year a drop in the ocean compared to the billions that could be recovered if this government was actually intent on tackling tax avoidance osbornes decision to let big companies shirk their responsibilities to society while forcing through more spending cuts is morally indefensible it is promising that the uk government has finally admitted that the uks crown dependencies the isle of man and the channels islands are harbouring over a billion pounds of evaded and avoided tax but the announcement of todays deal with the government will do nothing to help the worlds poorest people rather than just ensuring the uk government gets its share of the money these islands hide offshore the government should be taking urgent action to close down all the uks tax havens around the world to stop the flow of billions of pounds out of developing countries every year the manufacturers organisation welcomed the easing of the tax burden on businesses but said the budget feels like a job half done with regard to the extent of growth spending terry scuoler eefs chief executive said todays statement contained some helpful measures on business taxation and some signs of reprioritising spending for growth but it still feels like a job half done the chancellor had over bn of underspending in his arsenal and should have done more to drive growth now particularly through accelerating investment in infrastructure with forecasts for business investment scaled back heavily for the next five years the growth and investment challenge we face continues to mount looking to the spending review with the chancellor sticking to his fiscal plans this cant just be about tighter spending controls it must also be about a more radical of shift of spending towards growth a robust takedown of osbornes sums from the green party leader natalie bennett who says the chancellor is a man whos in a hole yet he compulsively cant stop digging the greens dismiss osbornes raising of the income tax threshold as superficial bennett says his slightly amended plan a for austerity with some small and largely unwise investments in trying to promote largely unaffordable private housing fracking and road building is effectively business as usual an approach that has delivered us youth unemployment of plummeting real wages and misery for benefit recipients what he should have done today is to announce a serious programme of investment in the successful green economy introduced steps to force banks to lend to small and mediumsized businesses and not further advantaged large corporations by further dropping the corporate tax rate he should have lifted caps on council borrowing for house building and provided direct capital spending to allow councils to build a mass programme of sustainable council housing we also should stop the tax relief on private pension plans and plough that billion a year into the basic state pension setting that at a level that immediate ensures no pensioner is living in poverty and reverse the realterms cuts to benefits contained in the sadly misnamed benefits uprating bill the move to raise the income tax threshold to by is one of those policies that sounds superficially attractive and progressive but as research by the resolution foundation has shown it is actually the wealthiest half of households that stand to most benefit from it people in the richest of households benefit by a year the poorest of households gain on average a year the worlds largest producer of spirits diageo is perhaps understandably aggrieved that beer was the only alcohol duty to get a cut this move is disappointing cutting duty on beer while increasing it on spirits punishes the uk spirits industry for its success in this harsh economic climate scotch is the uks biggest food and drink export this move risks that success the taxpayers alliance welcomes the cut in beer duty the freeze in fuel duty the increase in the personal tax allowance the cut in employers national insurance and the cut in corproation tax but it says the government has failed to simplify the tax system matthew sinclair chief executive of the taxpayers alliance said george osborne has announced welcome relief for people struggling with the high cost of living the cut in beer tax the freeze in fuel duty and the higher personal allowance will all ease the pressure on family budgets lower employers national insurance and corporation tax will also be passed on to workers in higher wages unfortunately the great limitation of this budget was that it relied far too much on complicated targeted reliefs instead of tax cuts across the board simpler strategic tax reforms that reduce the overall burden would be fairer and do more to produce the stronger economy britain needs the airlines however are not happy willie walsh chief executive of british airways parent company iag carolyn mccall chief executive of easyjet michael oleary chief executive of ryanair and craig kreeger chief executive of virgin atlantic jointly said we are very disappointed that the governments tax on flying already the highest in the world will increase yet again this year and next these rises in air passenger duty show the emptiness of rhetoric on boosting exports to emerging economies and building the most competitive tax system in the world increasing this alarmingly uncompetitive tax on business trade and inbound tourism beggars belief when the evidence clearly suggests that abolition would deliver growth create jobs and pay for itself through higher receipts from other taxes heres the british chambers of commerce which is largely upbeat in its appraisal of the budget john longworth director general of the bcc said while there is much for business to welcome in the chancellors statement such as reviewing the mpcs remit scrapping the rise on fuel duty and putting bn into helping buyers afford new homes he and his cabinet colleagues should have gone further to support enterprise and growth such as scrapping damaging increases in business rates we are at an unprecedented moment in economic history and the government should be doing everything in its power to get the economy moving many of the chancellors measures were targeted at larger corporates and those that will benefit smaller companies will not take effect until which is too late we need urgency scale and delivery today if britain is in a global race as the chancellor said in his speech our political elite needs to act accordingly and pull out all the stops to support enterprise jobs wealth creation and exports business will appreciate many of the chancellors measures and his personal commitment to fiscal discipline and support for enterprise but will wish he had been more radical in the pursuit of growth proponents of lowcarbon technologies were disappointed with the budget andrew raingold executive director of the aldersgate group which is an alliance of leaders from business politics and society that drive action for a sustainable economy said the chancellor has prioritised increasing exports to the fast growing regions of the world but there is little support in the budget for green industries that have a strong foothold in these markets and a trade surplus of bn rather than tax breaks for shale gas the uk needs a clear regulatory framework that will drive investment and export opportunities for low carbon technologies the institute of directors sounds a similarly positive note simon walker director general of the iod said we applaud this budget the chancellor has stuck to his guns and held his nerve which is exactly what we wanted to see deficit reduction is not an optional policy it is an absolute necessity and he is right to reject the siren calls to abandon it businesses will be glad that george osborne has also continued the downward pressure on corporation tax britain must become the most competitive place to do business and lower taxes will attract welcome investment from abroad the new allowance to reduce the tax on employing people is a welcome boost for businesses who are working hard to grow the private sector has done a huge amount to improve the employment figures and it is right that they are rewarded for doing so this will see more people helped out of unemployment which is a very good thing we have long called for a coordinated set of policies to encourage the development of a uk shale gas industry the chancellor is absolutely right to set attractive conditions for shale exploration this will create thousands of jobs and reduce our reliance on expensive foreign imports the federation of small businesses is full of praise for the budget john walker national chairman of the fsb said the fsb says the budget opens the door for small businesses to grow and create jobs the chancellor has pulled out all the stops with a wide ranging package of measures to support small business the fsb says the housing initiative will help reinvigorate the construction sector in which many of our members operate the national insurance cut goes beyond what we were asking for and we are pleased to see the scrapping of the p fuel duty due in september while beer drinkers of britain have applauded the abolition of the beer duty escalator mike benner chief executive of camra the campaign for real ale said this is a momentous day for britains beer drinkers who will tonight be raising a glass to the chancellor for axing this damaging tax escalator and helping keep pubgoing affordable for hardpressed consumers this decision will keep the lid on the cost of a pint down the pub since the duty escalator was introduced in pubs have been forced to call last orders for good what could have been the final nail in the coffin for our pubs has been decisively avoided by the chancellor in a move that will spark celebration in pubs across the uk scrapping the beer duty escalator combined with a p cut is a massive vote of confidence in british pubs and will lead to an increase in pub going and more money in the chancellors coffers the environmentalists are however up in arms over the annoucnement that the planned p fuel duty rise has been scrapped friends of the earth economics campaigner david powell said the chancellors refusal to raise fuel duty in line with inflation has deprived treasury coffers of bn in the last two years leaving other parts of the economy to pay the price the driving force behind rising petrol prices is the soaring cost of oil the sensible longterm plan is to protect motorists from rising fuel prices by weaning our transport system off its oil dependency the national housing federation meanwhile notes the danger of another housing bubble emerging from the measures the chancellor has presented national housing federation chief executive david orr said we welcome the chancellors realisation that people around the country are struggling to buy their own homes and the measures introduced today may help a number of them but the danger is that if we dont tackle the fact were still not building enough homes well just create another housing bubble that will continue to push house prices up and out of reach of the majority our housing market has long been weakened by the lack of new houses being built which are forcing up rental and house prices leaving millions of people struggling to get on the property ladder or pay their rent the government should be focusing on unlocking investment to build more new homes as a way of managing down the housing benefit bill and boosting the economy we welcome the measures to support new supply but they are very small scale and we still need the government to help unlock land banks free the small publicly owned derelict sites so we can build houses on them and give housing providers longterm certainty over how much income they can expect so they can start planning and building beyond with the impact of welfare reform still to be fully felt we need reassurance and longterm commitment so we can play our part in raising the finance needed to build more homes more on housing the home builders federation welcomes the government moves to help new homebuyers but sounds a note of caution stewart baseley executive chairman of hbf said a lack of affordable mortgage availability remains the biggest constraint on housing supply something government now clearly understands and is looking to address extending newbuy to the second hand market should create churn in the market place and drive up sales across the board including for new homes we do though need to ensure a level playing field across the whole market extending firstbuy is very welcome and will provide a real option for people currently unable to buy so providing a vital market for the new homes industry building the homes the country desperately needs can be a key driver of economic activity government must be praised for its attempts to stimulate activity but must also be wary to get the details right back to the accountants and ernst amp young which celebrates the chancellors sleight of hand chris sanger ernst amp youngs global head of tax policy said in a very combative budget speech in the house of commons with the shadow chancellor being admonished for not listening quietly george osborne started his speech by saying he was going to focus on those people saving for retirement and running a business with so little to play with the red book listed measures that had been previously announced and added a further the chancellors rabbit out of the hat was the new employment allowance which costing bn per annum by the end of the forecast period obscured the other probusiness cut in corporate tax rate to and even the achievement of the personal tax allowance for with almost bn being raised from tackling avoidance and collecting tax debts the overall cost of the policy decisions is broadly neutral for the fiscal finances given the constraints on the economy the chancellor may well feel that that was a magical performance the association of convenience stores on the other hand berates the chancellor for failing to act business rates acs chief executive james lowman said the budget does not include any radical changes that will transform confidence amongst everyday entrepreneurs like local shop owners the chancellor has failed to act on business rates and missed an opportunity to undertake the radical reform needed to encourage investment in high streets up and down the country but it is delighted by moves to reduce the cost of national insurance duty rates on beer and introduce faster payments for card transactions we welcome the employment allowance which will help local shops to take on more employees we are delighted that thousands of our members will have the opportunity to benefit from faster payment services for small supermarkets and petrol forecourt stores this will make a significant difference to cash flow keeping more stores open and able to invest in their business and their community we are working with the treasury to ensure that this service is made available swiftly and at low cost to retailers we welcome the decision to freeze beer duty this will benefit consumers and reduce some of the pressure on local shops losing trade to the illegal market its a shame this benefit will not be shared by customers buying wine spirits and cider the chancellor also managed to get housebuilders on side the british property federation welcomed the governments funding increase to kick start buildtorent schemes ian fletcher director of policy at the british property federation said its encouraging the governments confidence in build to rent has been reciprocated and we are delighted to see that the equity funding was heavily oversubscribed working in partnership with government the sector should deliver an exciting and quality array of homes for renters heres michael wistow head of tax at city law firm berwin leighton paisner on the changes to the corporation tax regime it can only be good news to reduce corporation tax rates from to per cent and to abolish transfer taxes on aim shares and to have an emphasis on reduced tax rates which result in the rich paying a higher proportion of total taxes raised than the populist concentration on rates of tax the abolition of schedule is an example of how the government can use the tax regime to the benefit of investors schedule was a complex and confusing area of taxation and its abolition will have a small and welcome benefit on the domestic funds industry on the bank levy increase versus the corporation tax cut it sounds like the bank levy increases two years before the corporation tax cut in that it is meant to match on the possible extensions to the funding for lending scheme mark blackwell managing director of xit property data specialists said funding for lending isnt really sustaining first time buyer activity and has been poorly targeted lower monthly payments for the betteroff those with the most equity will do little to lift a sluggish housing market given the governments pledge to support borrowers todays fall in gross mortgage lending will be a significant disappointment a one percent uplift in gross mortgage lending from a year ago is a very poor performance given the external impetus lenders are able to access including nonbanks in funding for lending could make the scheme more effective however lenders can be applauded for some of their caution a return to the recklessness of would be as much of a failure as a further collapse in lending levels quality of lending is as important as quantity proper property and credit risk management will be vital for a more sustainable model of lending in future actionaid adds its voice to the crowds welcoming the announcement on international aid the ngos uk head of advocacy melanie ward said todays budget announcement on aid will save lives and make history tonight in people across the world will go to bed hungry it is not the british way to walk by on the other side when others are in need and we can all be proud of keeping our nations promise not to forget the very poorest in the world even as we struggle ourselves uk aid is making an enormous difference across the world a difference that we at actionaid see for ourselves every day the government and opposition deserve credit for their consensus that keeping our year old promise on aid is the right thing to do just as uk aid saves lives poor countries are increasing the money they raise domestically through tax but the same accountancy tricks that cost the uk billions are being used by british firms operating in the developing world after much tough talk from the chancellor the tax avoidance measures announced today are nothing more than tinkering at the edges they are not designed to tackle the vast majority of tax avoidance techniques by multinationals either in the uk or abroad as the current chair of the g the uk has committed to stopping widespread international tax avoidance yet the chancellor has shown little appetite to start the crackdown at home despite polling showing that around three quarters of the public think it should echoing recommendations from the un imf and oecd to be taken seriously on the global stage in june the chancellor should use the finance bill to ensure uk multinationals have to disclose any tax avoidance around the world helping both the uk and the poorest countries to raise the revenues needed to fight poverty and end hunger we will be working with the if campaign to increase the pressure on him to do so unicef meanwhile welcomes the promise that britain will stick to spending of gross national income gni on international aid david bull unicef uks executive director said today is a historic day for the worlds poorest children and a proud day for britain keeping our promises to the worlds poorest children and their families is both the right thing to do and is in britains interests already aid has saved millions of childrens lives around the world and for that we should all hold our heads up high right now british aid is helping unicef to deliver nutrition safe drinking water essential vaccines education clothing and protection to millions of children affected by the crisis in syria by providing this much needed support unicef with the help of british aid is helping to ensure syrias children do not become a lost generation this is a clear example of british aid working hard for those that need it most is a tiny amount of our gni but as we are seeing in syria it can have a colossal impact on ordinary childrens lives chris sanger ernst amp youngs global head of tax policy comments on the reduction of the corporation tax rate by confirming that the uk corporate tax rate will drop to the chancellor has delivered the ambition he set out in the last budget the uks tax regime is already attracting more jobs and investment to our shores and this latest step reinforces the message that britain is open for business combined with confirmation of the gaar and the uks commitment to participating in the oecds project on international taxation the chancellor is making it clear that the uk is a competitive place to do business but that he expects all parties pay their fair share clients have been telling us that the uks tax regime is an asset but of the tax professionals we surveyed prior to the budget said that uncertainty created by the fair tax debate is a deterrent to increasing the level of their activities here the chancellors budget speech today will hopefully have helped to address some of these concerns heres deloitte on the governments plan to target offshore employment companies mark groom tax partner at deloitte said unless an offshore employer has a place of business in the uk or is required to account for tax or national insurance contributions nic under a treaty it wont usually be liable for uk tax or nic in respect of amounts paid to its employees the government is concerned by the impact on the benefit entitlements of individuals working in the uk but employed by offshore companies as well as the potential loss of tax and nic estimated at cm a year as well as teachers and nurses oil and gas workers are also under the spotlight but the rules relating to workers on the uk continental shelf are more complex it has long been accepted by hmrc that no liability arises in many of those cases well have to wait for the detail to be announced in a consultation document in may it seems likely that the government will want to consider ways to give the existing rules a bigger bite currently those businesses in the uk engaging workers the end users supplied by offshore employment companies can be liable for uk tax and nic but only in certain circumstances widening the scope and impact of those rules to make uk end users more clearly liable would be one possibility however any new legislation should not impact workers employed and working overseas although oil and gas workers were specifically mentioned the treatment of workers in the north sea is more complex and remains unclear heres nick beecroft senior analyst at saxo capital

the centrepiece of the budget will be a new system of taxfree childcare vouchers deliberately misnamed tax relief by the government for middle and higherincome families of the nearly bn earmarked for childcare m is going towards these new vouchers over time they will replace existing employersupported vouchers as such they are an improvement they are available to all families not just those whose employers happen to offer the scheme yet analysis by the resolution foundation shows that more than of families that will benefit from this new support from are in the top half of the workingage household income distribution they will be able to claim back of their childcare costs up to per child in fact even families with incomes up to will be eligible for support lowering the income cap to exclude more highincome families however would have freed up more money to invest in those on low and modest incomes who face the highest barriers to work because of childcare costs the government maintains that it would have been administratively complex to exclude all but the richest families those with one or more earners paying the top rate of tax but it saw fit to create a new threshold to meanstest child benefit the governments decision to direct the bulk of new money towards the better off means that extra support will not be available for all families in receipt of universal credit those families where both parents earn enough to pay income tax at least in will be able to claim rather than of their childcare costs which is a major improvement in helping to always make work pay however the vast majority of families who are set to receive universal credit will miss out these are lowerincome families with one parent working fulltime and another parttime who will not be eligible for additional support as well as excluding some of the families who most need help the government is making childcare more complex there will now be two levels of childcare support within universal credit in addition there is the promised support for middle and higherincome families there is also a third funding stream which will remain unchanged by the budget announcement this provides hours of free universal childcare for three and fouryearolds a new administrative system will be needed to ensure that parents can only claim support once for each child moreover the government has chosen to invest more money in demandside funding mechanisms when all the evidence is that they do nothing to hold down prices the cost of childcare has increased by in real terms over the last decade with annual increases far in excess of inflation there is no guarantee that all of todays new money will find its way to parents in the form of lower prices providers consistently report that they are underfunded and struggling to stay afloat there is nothing to stop them raising prices to take advantage of the new funding a better option would have been to build on the current universal entitlement as proposed by the commission on living standards providing an additional hours of childcare at very low cost say an hour would provide some support for all parents and allow more second earners to work parttime however it would not disproportionately skew the new investment towards the better off as the governments proposal does and by funding providers directly government would be better able to control costs and ensure that new spending translates into cheaper childcare for parents taking the nearly bn cost of the new proposals together with the m currently spent on the employersupported voucher the government could have funded an extension of the universal entitlement to almost hours in a time of austerity finding new money to invest in childcare is welcome and we should not overlook this but it makes the decision to invest the majority of that new money in better off families who can more easily afford childcare all the harder to understand,2013-03,centrepiece budget new system taxfree childcare voucher deliberately misnamed tax relief government middle higherincome family nearly bn earmarked childcare going towards new

george osborne is under pressure from conservative mps to introduce a promised marriage tax allowance to ensure that stayathome parents are not penalised by new childcare benefits unveiled by the government on tuesday as a charity warned of a fresh bout of discrimination against parents who sacrifice their careers to look after their children one tory made an thhour appeal to the chancellor before the budget to solve the problem at a stroke by introducing a transferable tax allowance the row broke out after the government announced that a m childcare scheme will only be available where both parents are in work with neither earning more than parents on joint incomes of up to will be eligible to claim of the costs of childcare worth up to this will provide help of a child per year families receiving tax credits or receiving the new universal credit will receive help under a different and more generous scheme liz truss the childrens minister rejected claims that the new scheme would disproportionately benefit affluent parents because only the highest rate taxpayers earning and above will be excluded she said the new scheme would benefit m people rather than the who benefit from the current employer supported childcare esc truss told the bbc everybody who is currently claiming employer vouchers will be able to continue claiming employer vouchers but we are making the system much fairer because at the moment it is based on household our system is based on a perchild amount so if you have two children you get three children that is much fairer because we all know childcare costs are related to the number of children and not the number of parents the scheme is also open much wider so anybody who is eligible who is working can go on to the internet sign up for an account it is going to be a very simple process and they can receive that funding at the moment only people can claim the employer vouchers this will be open to million people who will be able to sign up for it online it will be very simple you pay of the costs the government pays up to a maximum of per child the treasury faced questions when an internal question and answer document arguing that working parents are in greater need was released accidentally on its website under a section headed key rebuttals the language used in whitehall to help officials answer difficult questions it answered a mock question about why the scheme was not available to families where one parents stays at home this is in contrast to esc the document captured by the politics home website before it was withdrawn by the treasury said we need to focus our resources working families who are struggling with their childcare costs or families where parents want to go to work but cant afford to do so are in greater need of state support for childcare than families where one parent chooses to stay at home and look after children full time marie peacock chair of the mothers at home matter charity was highly critical of this thinking britain and mexico are the only nations in the western world where the family is not recognised as a household unit in the tax system all other democratic countries provide tax relief for parents wanting to fill the vital role of raising children we want to see a level playing field for childcare this has to mean tax breaks for families with one earner to compensate for the extra household costs of raising children and to ensure that we end the current sharp discrimination against stayathome mothers who choose to make a financial sacrifice to look after their babies and toddlers tory mps said that osborne should introduce the marriage tax allowance promised in the tory manifesto the liberal democrats are fiercely opposed to this measure but the chancellor has the right under the terms of the coalition agreement to put it before parliament the lib dems agreed in the coalition agreement to abstain in any vote on budget resolutions to introduce transferable tax allowances for married couples the tories would be in a strong position to win such a vote because they number in the commons against labour mps robert buckland the tory mp for swindon south said the announcement on childcare is welcome and it is addressing people who want to go to work but there is an equally valid decision by thousands of mums and dads to stay at home the best way to deal with this is to advance what was the conservative agenda to have a transferable tax allowance that would benefit the family the wage earner would have an increased protection and shelter from tax and the family would all benefit as a result buckland added that he was not pushing a traditional agenda because many fathers stay at home it is not about being traditional and saying mum must stay at home because many dads very often stay at home now where the mum has a high paid job and wants to go to work,2013-03,george osborne pressure conservative mp introduce promised

parents on joint incomes of up to will be eligible for taxfree childcare support worth a year under a new scheme that will be one of the central measures in wednesdays budget under the plan parents will be eligible to receive of their yearly childcare costs up to a year nick clegg hailed what the prime minister david cameron called a boost direct to the pockets of hardworking families but the resolution foundation thinktank criticised the government for helping richer parents while failing to recognise the barriers faced by poorer families speaking on bbc radio s today programme childcare minister elizabeth truss said the government was supporting lowincome families by ploughing m in additional income into the forthcoming universal credit system however truss said that million middleincome families also needed help what we are recognising is that there are families that are earning between and where it simply isnt worth their while going out to work at the moment because of the really expensive costs of childcare and we want to help those families who work hard and want to get on the m scheme which will be introduced in the autumn of after the next election will initially apply to children under the age of five providing help to million families it will eventually be extended to include children up to the age of both parents will have to be in work with neither earning more than to qualify the treasury confirmed that two parents with a joint income of would be eligible truss said only of women earn more than but admitted the childcare tax rebate had been capped at for a single earner for the sake of simplicity this voucher system is much better than its predecessor because every working family can access it million people can get it rather than the at the moment at the moment it is luck of the draw because many employers do not make use of the scheme its difficult for middle earners and it is right that they receive that support the minister said when asked why the government was not directly incentivising parents to stay at home with their children truss said we believe in marriage we believe in strong families but we believe in families making choices about how they look after their children its not a black and white choice clegg said the rising cost of childcare is one of the biggest challenges parents face and it means many mums and dads simply cant afford to work this not only hurts them financially but is bad for the economy too this announcement of a bn investment in childcare will make sure it pays to work an extra for each child will make a real difference to families who find themselves constantly worrying about how to juggle their family budget and extending support for working families on universal credit will make sure it is worth working extra hours even if youre on low wages the m costs of the scheme will be funded by new money from the budget and by phasing out the employer supported childcare esc claimed by families which is offered by just of employers parents who claim esc will be able to remain in the scheme though this will not be open to new claimants after the launch of the new scheme which will be more generous for parents with more than one child a source said the government already offered a great deal of support to lowerincome families as it continued a labour scheme to offer hours of free universal childcare to all three and fouryearolds this will be extended this year to all twoyearolds whose parents are from the most disadvantaged families later rising to gavin kelly chief executive of the resolution foundation said that overall most of the extra support will go to parents in the top half of the income distribution he said it is absolutely right that the government is making childcare more affordable for families it is a massive burden for millions of households however spending large sums on tax relief that tends to benefit higherincome families does not recognise that low and modestincome families face the highest barriers to work from childcare costs kelly raised concerns that families who receive support through tax credits and the universal credit which will be introduced in stages from next month until will not be eligible he said it is vital that the government revises universal credit to ensure that lowincome working families including the large number who work part time on low pay have an incentive to earn more kelly acknowledged that a further m will be provided to less affluent parents claiming universal credit though greater help will be provided to those in work the government will meet of the costs of childcare for parents on universal credit provided that both parents are working and that they earn more than the personal tax allowance which is due to reach by parents on universal credit who fail to earn this amount will be eligible for only of the costs of childcare the current amount on offer stephen twigg the shadow education secretary said todays announcement will not make up for the that families have lost in cuts to childcare support those who have seen their incomes cut because tax credits have been cut will not get any help that is deeply unfair parents will be disappointed that three years into this government they will not get any help with childcare costs for another two and a half

the victim in the steubenville rape case known in most but not all of the media coverage of the case as jane doe was taught by her rapists her thenfriends and much of her hometown that she doesnt matter she didnt matter to the boys who made use of her unconscious body to satisfy their own sexual urges and desire for power she didnt matter to her friends who sided with those boys and she didnt matter to the football boosters in her hometown who were unwilling to see their pride in the team tarnished by the actions of two of its players she learned that a lot of people around her including some in positions of power thought that the futures of her rapists were more important than what theyd done to her and what shed have to learn to live with and after the verdict that found the boys delinquent ohio juvenile courtspeak for guilty of a felony if she was unfortunate enough to be paying attention to the way some news organizations presented the verdict she learned that the locals were not alone in that judgment it wasnt enough that abc aired a rosy profile of one of the nowconvicted rapists before the trial emphasizing his happy mood the night of the rape and his football career instead cnn anchor candy crowley and correspondent poppy harlow talked about how hard it was to watch the convicted rapists break into tears given their good grades and again their footballplaying prowess nbcs ron allen spoke eloquently about the boys dreams of college and again their football skills now wasted by their convictions and of course the ap usa today and yahoo stories about the convictions all led off with how the victim in the case of whom the boys were convicted of raping was reportedly drunk on the night in question the convicted rapists intoxication or lack thereof was not apparently editorially important generally speaking the news media dont lament the theretofore bright futures of young men or women convicted of other violent crimes such as the killing of girlfriends or executing downontheirluck jobhunters they dont grieve at the loss of college football careers for kids convicted of drugrelated offenses or empathize with wouldbe murderers who break down in tears when faced with consequences for the crimes they committed they dont assign deeper motivations to the tears of men and women who must now contend with the most openly broken part of the american criminal justice system incarceration to which around million americans are currently consigned at prisoners per citizens the highest rate of imprisonment in the world and which is widely recognized as minimally rehabilitative and maximally punitive but rape isnt any other crime in america or elsewhere statistics show that every rapes in america results in only five felony convictions its the only crime in which the level of intoxication of the victim is considered by some like the convicted rapists lawyers and some in the media to be mitigating evidence its the only crime in which the perceived attractiveness of the perpetrators to other people or the victim is considered relevant information its the only one in which were encouraged to sympathize with why perpetrators picked their victims their supposed drunkenness their clothes their reputations and then blame the victims for making themselves attractive targets and its probably the only crime these two boys could have committed and gotten international coverage for their football prowess and the supposed harm that the victim not the two rapists did to their team but when everyone is done being sympathetic to two convicted rapists whose own bad decisions not those of the victim or those made within the criminal justice system put three promising young lives on very different paths than the ones on which they started that terrible night maybe then they can give some thought to the young girl it is she whose body was violated by two boys and hundreds of thousands of strangers who has to walk into a school and among residents of a town where some people want her not just shamed for her own sexual assault but dead for reporting it for her the few memories of that night but the many of its extended aftermath cannot be erased and maybe then everyone could spare some sympathy for the next girl and the one after that and all the victims of sexual assault who are created at an average of one every two minutes in america because its only by reversing who automatically qualifies for societys sympathy that we can even start to make an impression on the needs of those who really

moves to make childcare more affordable by increasing the number of children who can be supervised in groups are meeting fierce opposition from key providers across the country the coalition government has made helping working parents afford childcare a priority in january it launched more great childcare a blueprint to overhaul the childcare system it has also drawn up plans to allocate more than bn in the form of tax breaks and credits to help working parents afford nursery places the cash boost which could be announced in this weeks budget follows a row between the tories and the lib dems about the level of provision that should be made to help working parents afford childcare however hopes that the longtrailed tax breaks championed by lib dem leader nick clegg will allow the government to present itself as being on the side of hardworking families are in danger of being eclipsed by a growing revolt by key childcare providers a survey to be published this month by the national childrens bureau charity suggests that the government may be forced to rethink the proposals experts have drawn a comparison with the uturn over gcse reforms made by the education secretary michael gove in the face of implacable opposition from teachers the survey of childcare providers working in local authorities nurseries and voluntary sector groups in england found fierce hostility to the reforms which are the subject of a consultation that closes on march any climbdown over ratios would be a major setback for the governments plans in an introduction to the more great childcare proposals the childrens minister liz truss said britain had some of the highest childcare costs in the world under the plans staff will be able to take charge of six twoyearolds rather than four the ratio for underones will increase from three to four ministers believe expanding the ratios will improve quality and cut costs they point out that in the netherlands and ireland a nursery worker can look after six twoyearolds in france the figure rises to eight other countries such as denmark germany and sweden have no mandatory ratios but the bureau survey the first of its kind found that of the childcare providers it questioned opposed the relaxation of the ratios threequarters raised concerns about the effect the move would have on childrens welfare safety and wellbeing one provider said the staff member will be providing basic care needs and will not have the time to provide stimulating individual activities for children and safeguarding issues may be missed nearly of respondents said childminders should not be able to look after a greater number of children under five for similar reasons they also had concerns about plans to make ofsted the sole arbiter of quality in the childcare sector many providers claimed that without regular oversight from local authorities the quality of childcare provision would deteriorate and in the words of the ncb report problems could go unnoticed for months or even years hilary emery chief executive of the bureau said its survey showed that the governments plans could backfire there is a strong message coming through that whilst there is agreement that the government needs to act in order to make childcare more affordable there are widely held fears that allowing providers to take on more children in the same space with the same number of staff could put childrens welfare at risk the current staff to child ratios one childminder to three underfives or one nursery worker to three children under the age of two need to be maintained to ensure our youngest children are safe but not all practitioners agree ben black director of my family care has said that giving nurseries a bit more leeway on ratios is absolutely the right approach and would lead to better paid jobs better quality and more affordable childcare a department for education spokesman said the bureau survey was a selfselecting and unscientific survey from an organisation that had opposed its reforms no childcare provider will be forced to use the new ratios as they are entirely optional the spokesman said only providers with wellqualified staff will be able to move to use them,2013-03,move make childcare affordable increasing number child supervised group meeting fierce opposition key provider across country coalition government ha made

a tax break to ease the costs of childcare which was at the heart of a new year relaunch of the coalition is to be delayed as worsening public finances leave george osborne struggling to balance the nations books david cameron and nick clegg are to join forces on tuesday to launch a series of childcare initiatives which the prime minister described last week as a very major step forward but osborne is expected to announce in the budget on wednesday that it will take time possibly until after the general election in to add a new tax break of up to to existing childcare help the chancellor will unveil a crackdown on offshore tax avoidance by strengthening legislation to prevent companies paying employees through offshore intermediaries based in places such as jersey up to workers are

will introduce new powers to clamp down on companies who avoid tax by putting their payrolls in tax havens our message is clear british firms employing british workers must pay british taxes labour will attack the delay in the childcare tax break blaming the move on the poor state of the public finances after the institute for fiscal studies warned that the chancellor is likely to have to admit that borrowing will increase this year stephen twigg the shadow education secretary said david camerons government will have cost parents bn in support by the next election families are being hit in the pocket and they are seeing their local childrens centres closing down mums need real help now not years down the line the only people who will benefit this april are the millionaires who are getting a tax cut parents need to be supported so they can get back into work and get our economy growing again the treasury is likely to dismiss labours argument and to say that a complex tax break cannot be introduced immediately and that the delay has been caused by the practicalities of implementing a major change work will have to be carried out to target the right people osborne is understood to be keen to introduce the change as quickly as possible but after last years budget when he announced a cut in the top rate of income tax from p to p which led to rows about the granny tax and the pasty tax the chancellor wants to make sure the implementation of a childcare tax break is watertight it is understood that the chancellor will give an indication of the year though not the month in which he hopes to introduce the change under one scenario doing the rounds in whitehall he could announce that once the liberal democrat goal of raising the personal tax allowance has reached the focus could shift to a childcare tax allowance the prime minister will argue on saturday that help for childcare lies at the heart of his campaign to build an aspiration nation in his speech to the conservative spring forum he will say the global race is not just about gdp its about saying to the mum whos worried about her childrens future we are building a country where there is a future so your kids wont have to get on a plane to get on in life they can make it right here in britain its what this partys always been about aspiration he will hail three great conservatives winston churchill harold macmillan and margaret thatcher for putting in place ladders that help people improve their lives he will say great conservatives down the generations have put those ladders in place when churchill invented the labour exchanges that helped people into work when macmillan built new homes when thatcher fired up enterprise so people could start their own businesses thats what were doing in the conservative party right now thatcher climbed up the ladder as the daughter of a grocer but churchill and macmillan had less far to climb if indeed they ever clambered upon the

next weeks budget will according to david cameron be more of the same it will be disastrous if it is not just for an economy that has flatlined but for families who are feeling squeezed parents have lost most of all through cuts in family support and childcare its time for the prime minister to put that right new figures today show that by the next general election five years of david cameron in downing street will have cost parents bn and up to bn a year by theres no doubt that everyone on low and middle incomes is feeling it in their pockets parents with newborns are losing thousands in childcare grants families on higher incomes are losing thousands in child benefit but for one group things are set to get easier the handful of people who earn more than m who will get a tax cut in just three weeks time while theyre the people being helped by this government struggling parents have been the biggest losers hit with cuts to tax credits and maternity pay and with sure start stripped back and child benefit taken away and there are fewer childrens centres than in as earlyyears budgets have been badly hit at the same time as families get less support and incomes are falling childcare costs are rising its no wonder were seeing a crisis in the affordability of childcare incredibly at one central london nursery you would have to pay a year for one fulltime nursery place thats nearly twice what most people earn this is the childcare triple whammy less support fewer places and higher costs yet it is a childcare crisis of david camerons own making support for childcare has been slashed and families with two children have lost up to in childcare tax credit they havent got that kind of cash to spare to pay their extra childcare bills and many have been forced to give up work or cut their hours instead the truth is if you cut childcare support you hurt the economy taking away help for families means there is less chance for parents especially mothers to go back to work the government is also undermining the quality of childcare a report by two expert academics which the department for education refuses to publish warned that the plan to increase the number of children each nursery staff member looks after would threaten quality and not reduce costs the prime minister boasted at prime ministers questions last wednesday that he would help with childcare we hope thats right but it will be only a drop in the ocean compared with the bn hes taken away he will be judged by the cuts to childcare and family support he has made so far the chancellor should be providing immediate help for families struggling to afford childcare because of the cuts he has made if the prime minister has found money to start making good the damage done so far they could start for example by reversing cuts to childcare tax credits stopping cuts to maternity pay stopping the bedroom tax and restoring the p rate paid for by a mansion tax would be much fairer than cutting taxes for millionaires too either way he must make sure low and middleincome families get help as they are struggling most to afford childcare and stay in work the most costeffective step towards expanding childcare provision would be to extend free places for three and fouryearolds from to hours a week finding a job that fits in with nursery hours isnt easy so this would give parents an extra incentive to go back to work which would be good for our flatlining economy we also want to see more flexibility in the system for those who dont work standard hours for the medium and longer term labour is considering the best way to expand reform and improve good affordable childcare we need to increase quality as well as making childcare more affordable thats why labours childcare commission is looking to countries such as denmark and sweden for inspiration they have outstanding nurseries and higher rates of female employment and have managed to keep costs down for taxpayers weve seen months of dithering and infighting from this government on childcare if it is at last ready to act it will be judged against the bn bill it has already asked parents to pay it needs to come forward with a credible plan in this budget one that will cut costs to parents and make up for the cuts it has made the budget should be providing immediate help for parents not some promise of support long after the next election at the next election the biggest issue on peoples minds will be the cost of living the question that families will ask is am i better or worse off than in right now families with children know the answer is a resounding no,2013-03,next week budget according david cameron disastrous economy ha flatlined family feeling squeezed parent lost cut family support childcare time prime minister put right new figure today show next general election five year david cameron downing street cost parent bn bn year doubt everyone low middle income feeling pocket parent newborn losing thousand childcare grant family higher income losing thousand child benefit one group thing set get easier handful people earn get tax cut three week time theyre people helped government struggling parent biggest loser hit cut tax credit maternity pay sure start stripped back child benefit taken away fewer childrens centre earlyyears budget badly hit time family get less support income falling childcare cost rising wonder seeing crisis affordability childcare incredibly one central london nursery would pay year one fulltime nursery place thats nearly twice people earn childcare triple whammy less support fewer place higher cost yet childcare crisis david camerons making support childcare ha slashed family two child lost childcare tax credit havent got kind cash spare pay extra childcare bill many forced give work cut hour instead truth cut childcare support hurt economy taking away help family mean less chance parent especially mother go back work government also undermining quality childcare report two expert academic department education refuse publish warned plan increase number child nursery staff member look would threaten quality reduce cost prime minister boasted prime minister question last wednesday would help childcare hope thats right drop ocean compared bn taken away judged cut childcare family support ha made far chancellor providing immediate help family struggling afford childcare cut ha made prime minister ha found money start making good damage done far could start example reversing cut childcare tax credit stopping cut maternity pay stopping bedroom tax restoring rate paid mansion tax would much fairer cutting tax millionaire either way must make sure low middleincome family get help struggling afford childcare stay work costeffective step towards expanding childcare provision would extend free place three fouryearolds hour week finding job fit nursery hour isnt easy would give parent extra incentive go back work would good flatlining economy also want see flexibility system dont work standard hour medium longer term labour considering best way expand reform improve good affordable childcare need increase quality well making childcare affordable thats labour childcare commission looking country denmark sweden inspiration outstanding nursery higher rate female employment managed keep cost taxpayer weve seen month dithering infighting government childcare last ready act judged bn bill ha already asked parent pay need come forward credible plan budget one cut cost parent make cut ha made budget

men dominate the list of newly selected labour parliamentary candidates in the partys target winnable seats for the election wherever the selection has been kept open to men and women since the last election an astonishing of the nominations in open contests for target seats have been won by men figures given to the partys national executive show overall this trend has been countered by labours continued use of allwomen shortlists in many constituencies since the election allwomen shortlists have been drawn up in target seats so of the total of target seats where candidates have been chosen so far have gone to women but only thanks to the use of positive discrimination it may be argued that constituencies that refused to run allwomen shortlists were aware of the number of such lists in other seats and therefore felt free to select men or that the most impressive women candidates were on the allfemale lists either way labour has selected a man in almost every constituency where an allwomen list has been blocked with the election little more than two years away the parties are rapidly getting their candidates in place the liberal democrats are deciding how many candidates they will need based on a strategy to campaign largely on their local record meaning incumbency will be key labour is the only party to use allwomen shortlists to counteract the apparent continuing prejudice in politics in favour of selecting men it had been hoped that their use over the past decade would lead to a natural willingness by constituency parties to select women in open contests but if anything the tide is running in the opposite direction the labour list website points out that in byelection selections which are always open to both sexes only four of the candidates have been women since may only three women lucy powell seema malhotra and debbie abrahams have beaten male candidates in open selections coventry councillor lynnette kelly was selected for warwick and leamington but she defeated another female candidate labour is aiming for half its selections to be from allwomen lists in most regions the partys national executive has already decided which constituency selections should be open and which should be closed to men the national executive is trying to do this on a regional basis but has to take into account that labour is more likely to win seats in some regions than others in total the nec has agreed recommendations for targeted parliamentary constituencies with allwomen shortlists a separate process is under way for labourheld seats in which the sitting labour mp is standing down in the current parliament of labour mps are women a considerably better representation than the other parties the tories have and the lib dems however as a result of losing seats in the election the total number of women labour mps fell from to the conservatives created a priority list of candidates known as the a list of whom were women leading to a doubling of tory mps to short of its target of the use of allwomen lists has been controversial in the labour party in the election the labour candidate in blaenau gwent was defeated and the local party accused headquarters of not listening in choosing from an allwomen list david cutts and paul widdop in the british journal of politics and international research have reported there was no negative reaction from the electorate in the election when a candidate was selected from an allwomen shortlist even after taking into account incumbency status in labour was found by an industrial tribunal to be in breach of the sex discrimination act and was forced to cease the selection of candidates based on allwomen lists the law was subsequently changed a labour spokesman said the shortlists were the only way to guarantee women made progress in politics and added that less than of tory candidates were women,2013-03,men dominate list newly selected labour parliamentary candidate

in unveiling his study on the incidence of false allegations in rape and domestic violence the director of public prosecutions keir starmer refers to the misplaced belief that false allegations of rape and domestic violence are rife police told to be more robust in pursuing rape allegations march no evidence is presented in his study to indicate how widespread among the public such a belief might be however as we have previously demonstrated through a series of articles the suggestion in a wellknown study using mock juries that myths about rape victim behaviour probably diminish the conviction rate in rape trials is negated by official statistics which clearly show that juries are not acquitting rape accused any less often than they are in the generality of offences of serious violence few sensible people would contend that false rape allegations are rife in the sense of epidemic the serious issue has always been whether they are more or less prevalent than in serious offences generally to a degree which is statistically significant it has been contended by a number of politicians and others in positions of influence perhaps most notably by the head of cps london in january last year that the incidence of false allegations is actually lower in rape cases than in other offences mr starmers own statistics prove the contrary the study reveals that over a month period in england and wales there were prosecutions for rape and prosecutions for making false rape allegations in the same period we are told there were prosecutions for domestic violence but only six prosecutions for making false allegations of such with a pocket calculator and the back of an envelope one can see that in statistical terms the incidence of prosecutions for false allegations in rape was pro rata a staggering times greater than it was in cases of domestic violence less prevalent or what david wolchover bell yard chambers anthony heatonarmstrong bell yard chambers finally the assumption that women regularly and habitually lie about rape and domestic abuse is being challenged and i am deeply grateful to keir starmer and the guardian so far the focus has been on the police and the cps but similar scrutiny needs to be applied to the family courts and the advisory service cafcass cafcass has recently revoked the use of its domestic violence toolkit and regularly recommends contact that allows abuse to both women and children to continue in some cases leading to their deaths the family court system particularly private law application where domestic violence and contact are the issue is informed by the assumption that women habitually lie about rape and abuse neither cafcass staff magistrates judges or court clerks receive any professional training in domestic violence issues and the use of finding of fact hearings remain deeply flawed the removal of legal aid for most contact applications involving domestic violence will ultimately lead to more

foster carers who look after more than one child could still be charged hundreds of pounds a year after being classed as having extra rooms under the new bedroom tax rule of housing benefit ministers said this week that up to foster carers would be exempt from the underoccupancy benefits deduction as part of a series of partial concessions but charities said the exemption would only apply to a single additional room and would not apply to carers in receipt of housing benefit who looked after more than one child including older siblings foster carers affected by the bedroom tax who look after more than one child could now face having to apply for financial support to a discretionary housing fund set up by the government they will have to reapply to the fund every six weeks even if looking after children on a longterm basis robert tapsfield chief executive of the fostering network said while we are delighted for the many foster carers who are now exempt from the housing benefit penalty we are extremely concerned for those who have more than one bedroom for fostered children forcing foster carers to rely on the discretionary housing fund was always an inherently flawed idea the fostering network identified many examples of bad practice and confusion and reported these to the dwp department for work and pensions persuading them of the need to change policy by restricting this exemption to those who only foster one child the government is leaving many foster carers struggling to get access to the fund the fostering network said it did not know what proportion of uk foster carers looked after more than one child foster carers in england often receive approval to foster up to three children at a time the charity which in its initial response to the governments apparent concession on tuesday said foster carers would sleep easy stated that after having had clarification from the dwp it was now disappointed and would be renewing its campaign against the tax the benefit deduction to come into effect in april will be applied to workingage claimants in social housing who are rated as having more bedrooms than they require tenants affected will face a cut in housing benefit for the first excess bedroom and where two or more bedrooms are underoccupied the government which estimates the average household affected will lose a week says the policy will save the exchequer m a year the government said on tuesday that foster carers would be allowed an additional room as long as they had fostered a child or become a registered carer in the past months a spokesperson for the dwp said weve just announced that foster carers on benefits are entitled to a spare room and they are also better off because we do not take into account any income made from

the crown prosecution service has come a long way in dealing with cases involving violence against women and girls in the last year we have seen the conviction rate rise to delivering the lowest attrition rates ever recorded the cps has now published a trailblazing report on socalled false allegations of rape or domestic violence in recent years both the police and prosecutors have put a great deal of effort into improving the way we investigate and prosecute sexual offences the results of the changes and improvements that have been made are encouraging our committed and specialist staff have prioritised performance in these important and difficult cases we have bolstered training policies and guidance for rape and domestic violence specialists closer working with the police and specialist services has helped to address the types of ingrained practices that can ignore or even add to the victimisation of women and girls but there is still more that we must do to improve in recent years we have worked hard to dispel the damaging myths and stereotypes associated with these cases one such misplaced belief is that false allegations of rape and domestic violence are rife this report presents a more accurate picture at the outset it is important that we acknowledge the very damaging impact that a false allegation of rape or sexual assault be it either malicious or misguided can have on the person falsely accused reputations can be ruined and lives can be devastated as a result such cases will be dealt with robustly and those falsely accused should feel confident that the cps will prosecute these cases wherever there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to do so however these cases can be extremely complicated in november the court of appeal considered an appeal against sentence in the case of ms a who ultimately pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice on the basis that she had falsely retracted true allegations of rape she had made against her husband this case underlined the need for police and prosecutors fully to investigate and carefully to consider the circumstances in which an allegedly false claim of rape sexual assault or domestic violence is made following this case and in order further to support prosecutors in their decision making i published new legal guidance on perverting the course of justice in july for a period of months i also required cps areas to refer all cases involving an allegedly false allegation of rape domestic violence or both to me personally to consider this report outlines the key findings from the review of those cases and the steps that we plan to take importantly what it shows is that charges brought for perverting the course of justice or wasting police time for such false allegations need to be considered in the context of the total number of prosecutions brought for those offences in the period of the review there were prosecutions for rape and for domestic violence during the same period there were prosecutions for making false allegations of rape six for making false allegation of domestic violence and three for making false allegations of both rape and domestic violence furthermore the report shows that a significant number of these cases involved young often vulnerable people about half of the cases involved people aged years old and under and some involved people with mental health difficulties in some cases the person alleged to have made the false report had undoubtedly been the victim of some kind of offence even if not the one that he or she had reported this review has highlighted the complex nature of these cases prosecutors need to look critically at the behaviour and credibility of all those involved not just the person making the complaint in addition the events of the last year have demonstrated that there is an urgent need for an informed national debate about the proper approach to the investigation and prosecution of sexual offences that debate needs to extend well beyond the cps and the police i know that this report will help us to ensure that we are able to make consistent and sound decisions in cases involving allegedly false allegations i hope too that it will help to inform the wider debate i look forward to working with colleagues and stakeholders on these important issues,2013-03,crown

a misplaced belief that false accusations of rape or domestic violence are commonplace may be undermining police and prosecutors efforts to investigate such crimes the director of public prosecutions has warned keir starmer qc speaking as he published a study showing there were only a few false allegations during months over and said police should not adopt an overcautious approach because of the understandable concern that some allegations are false in the aftermath of the jimmy savile scandal and separate concerns about the handling of rape cases by two police forces starmer told the guardian because people recognise the devastating effect of false allegations and because they perceive there to be more false allegations than this report would suggest there are arguably they adopt a cautious approach if that leads to a more rigorous test being applied when people report rape or domestic violence then that can lead to injustice for victims the study released on wednesday by the crown prosecution service cps reveals that during the month test period when all false allegation cases were referred to the dpp there were prosecutions for rape and for domestic violence in england and wales by comparison over the same timespan there were only prosecutions for making false allegations of rape six for false allegations of domestic violence and three that involved false allegations of both rape and domestic violence victims of rape and domestic violence must not be deterred from reporting the abuse they have suffered starmer says in the foreword to the report we have worked hard to dispel the damaging myths and stereotypes which are associated with these cases one such misplaced belief is that false allegations of rape and domestic violence are rife starmers latest comments which relate primarily to adults come in the week that her majestys inspectorate of constabulary concluded that saviles sexual abuse could have been stopped as early as but the police mishandled evidence and dismissed victims last month it emerged that police at a specialist sex crimes unit in southwark south london had manipulated crime statistics by failing to record sexual assault allegations in according to a report by the independent police complaints commission the guardian has also revealed that the ipcc has raised concerns about the way police in south wales have handled allegations of assaults after the deaths of four women in domestic violence incidents the mere fact that someone did not pursue a complaint or retracted it is not of itself evidence that it was false starmer said the reports demonstration that false allegations were relatively rare is therefore highly significant he said thats why the numbers are really important the cps report written by alison levitt qc principal legal adviser to the dpp also aims to dispel the prejudice that those who make repeated complaints about being victims of sexual crimes should not be believed it states research indicates that a person may be targeted precisely because she is vulnerable and as a result there is every possibility that she may have been a victim of rape or other violence on more than one occasion false allegations can ruin reputations and devastate lives starmer added such cases will be dealt with robustly and those falsely accused should feel confident that the criminal justice system will prosecute these cases wherever there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to do so of suspects linked to allegedly false claims referred to the cps between january and may were women nearly half of them were or under one surprise was that in of those investigations the initial complaint of rape or domestic violence was made by someone other than the suspect among those under it was and often involved a parent it was a feature of these cases that the suspect later reported that the whole thing had spiralled out of control and he or she had felt unable to stop the investigation the cps report says the exceptionally high levels of domestic violence revealed in the figures are in line with recent increases citizens advice said last week it had seen an increase in cases of domestic violence reported to it in the last three months of compared with the year before starmer said i have raised concerns about the levels of domestic violence prevalent among young people in particular young girls aged to are probably now most at risk we may have a new generation suffering from such abuse i have no reason to think this problem is reducing following completion of the cps study false allegation cases involving rape and domestic violence will no longer routinely be referred to the dpp these cases will now be handled by cps areas rather than headquarters but we will continue to have an assurance regime where reports are sent in every six months starmer said sample cases will be checked periodically to ensure they are being handled correctly he added he said he was confident that all of the prosecutions that took place during the month period were correctly handled and necessary he responded to a letter in the guardian from women against rape and others who complained that rape victims continue to be prosecuted and that it prevents victims from coming forward and encourages rapists to attack again in a new letter today starmer writes false allegations of rape are rare but they can and do devastate the lives of those falsely accused and must be treated seriously my guidance to prosecutors highlights the fact that these cases must be informed by wider circumstances for example a prosecution would be highly unlikely where a woman may have retracted a true allegation of rape in the context of an abusive relationship the cps report highlighted increasing use of mobile phones in rape cases as in all other areas of crime there have been cases where offenders have sent pictures to humiliate victims it also pointed to occasions where those accused of rape recorded the incident to prove sex had been consensual in one case referred to in the report a group of men who had given a woman a lift home

cometh the hour cometh the woman or rather the women for it seems you wait three decades for another plausible female prime minister only for two to arrive at once when theresa may and yvette cooper locked horns last week over immigration it felt oddly like a portent of what may be to come they are radically different characters cooper warm and selfdeprecating may more reserved and a little chilly but both have matured into formidable enough politicians that it no longer seems farfetched to envisage them clashing over a primeministerial despatch box and after so many years of being treated as outsiders at westminster suddenly the time feels right for female politicians theres much to be said for not being just another man in a pinstriped suit in an age of contempt for conventional politicians may and cooper the vicars daughter and the former special adviser are hardly antiestablishment rebels but somehow their sex means they are not quite classed as part of a discredited elite either people do seem to think that women must get it they must be a bit more normal women get a pass on some of the politicians are all evil stuff says a former labour minister who argues that female candidates now hold a tangible advantage in byelections they are she thinks seen as more trustworthy less tarnished hard to imagine may or cooper groping candidates or palming off their speeding points i think theres something interesting about women in this atmosphere with men blamed for ruining their own lives making inappropriate passes all that confirms a tory backbencher who knows may well women make different mistakes but they dont often make the mistakes of predatory sexual behaviour and theresas not going to be starstruck by people with a lot of money the intriguing question is whether british politics has hit a glass cliff moment the phenomenon whereby companies pick female chief executives only when they are in deep trouble and subconsciously open to trying something different female leaders often emerge in countries in crisis from iceland after the banking crash to argentina is britain now experiencing something similar and if so can these two seize the moment theresa may theresa may is perhaps the most maddeningly inscrutable conservative in politics today her speech last weekend to conservativehomes victory conference outlining bold thinking on everything from the economy complete with a growth strategy she prepared earlier to privatisation offered the first real hint of where she might take the country if she ever had the chance but while few tory mps now doubt she covets the leadership most have no idea what she would actually do with it what exactly does may stand for she was a moderniser before david cameron was even an mp yet morphed into a traditionally rightwing home secretary once dismissed as overpromoted she has sturdily weathered scandals from border control chaos to her muchridiculed claim that an illegal immigrant avoided deportation because of his cat and intriguingly she has succeeded on her own terms she defies both conventional wisdom that home secretaries must be mediafriendly big beasts and the unspoken rule that tory women avoid the fword theresa may is an unabashed feminist the influential conservativehome website calls her britains merkel after the german chancellor a seriousminded woman for serious times i like her quiet competence her lack of froth says tim montgomerie the sites founder he sees a good person at heart capable of rare thoughtfulness and loyalty not everyone however buys it ive known theresa for years and my impressions of her are nothing says one mp close to a leadership rival theres no emotion there nobody really knows her and if you want to be leader youve got to have a personality the old jibe that her shoes are the most interesting thing about her is horribly unfair but people fixate on them still because they symbolise a promise thats never quite delivered leopardprint kitten heels beneath a sober suit suggest a defiant unconventional streak somewhere but boy does she keep it hidden yet may can be fearlessly stubborn over things that matter to her as the chancellor is discovering in trying to cut her budget and for one accused of lacking a grand vision she has a surprisingly strong claim to have helped make her party what it is today the a list scheme for selecting more female and nontraditional candidates which she battled ferociously to introduce has transformed the tories intake and changed the dynamics of this parliament ten years on the speech in which she bluntly told her tribe they couldnt win as the nasty party remains the iconic moment of tory modernisation braver than hugging huskies she defied her then leader iain duncan smith and her own aides advice to do it she was right then and shes right now recalls a former party staffer but the media saw it as a complete stab in the heart for everything the conservative party stands for a brutal year ensued as rightwing newspapers eviscerated her and pensioners tore up party membership cards in front of her but says a longstanding friend it definitely toughened her up certainly the old joke about her indecisiveness theresa may or she may not no longer fits she wields clout in cabinet manages the commons with steely relish she doesnt do small talk not for her the cosy personal anecdotes politicians tell to soften their images and has few close friends in politics shes cool and that counters peoples expectations of what they think a leading politician should be observes a tory backbencher but i have confidence in her i trust that if shes given something to do she wont cock it up so far her embryonic campaign consists mainly of old friends said to include excabinet ministers cheryl gillan and caroline spelman gently reminding people of her existence rival camps suspect she was spooked into making a speech after realising events may be moving faster than expected but she has yet to find an answer to her biggest problem boris johnson his flaws are only too well known to tory mps but the mayor remains the only candidate likely on current polling to boost conservative vote share and thus save their skins if he were leader in any contest held before that will overwhelmingly be what counts mays best hope is probably delaying the contest for long enough that she can put in some intensive spadework with mps something boris notoriously doesnt bother doing he spends his free time doing what he wants observes one staffer who knows both well politicians like theresa spend their time doing what everyone else wants them to do she is says one grateful alister the patron saint of female backbenchers always ready with advice she holds weekly surgeries for mps tirelessly attends constituency dinners her husband philip a senior city figure also networks hard for her people like spending time with him which does nothing but good for her says a friend having never had children shes free to work punishingly long hours her current pitch on curbing immigration and withdrawing from the european convention on human rights seems odd for an archmoderniser but friends insist its less cynical than it looks the thing about theresa is shes not as posh as the rest of them says a former aide shes more in touch with the people shes meeting in surgeries my bet is shes thinking what fool wouldnt address this her speech was carefully pitched at bluecollar tories on tight incomes feeling neglected by a cabinet of millionaires and tempted by ukip andy coulson the extabloid editor turned downing st spinner always rated her ability to reach his old readers but the next election wont be won by merely wooing back ukip defectors which means the real battle looming is with mays labour opposite number yvette cooper it is a backhanded compliment to yvette cooper in a way that the treasury will host a prebudget party this week to mend fences with women more than anyone else she has articulated a female anger over the recession which ministers are now scrabbling to defuse as shadow womens minister she has embarrassed the coalition by painstakingly analysing how women suffer disproportionately more from spending cuts because they are disproportionately poor by chipping away on female unemployment rates and maternity pay cuts she gave austerity a recognisably female face if you look at the difference between what women and men think about this government women started off thinking about the same as men and they are now incredibly hostile towards government says a senior labour backbencher that is basically to yvettes credit without an economic brief she has somehow become central to the economic argument that dominates contemporary politics now in her other role as shadow home secretary shes tackling westminsters second hottest topic immigration last weeks threat to restrict access to benefits for newcomers was the sort of populist rightwing idea for which blairite colleagues get pilloried but somehow cooper pitched it just this side of shrill even colleagues who loathe what they see as pandering to the right arent yet criticising her out loud the tory benches are rattled wondering aloud what it all means i always thought yvette was the brightest talent on the labour frontbench says louise mensch the extory mp turned columnist who has long had cooper on her list of women to watch i was personally glad she didnt stand for the leadership because i think shed have been unbeatable yet when cooper refused to run in because her children were still small conventional wisdom suggested she had made herself look fatally weak privately some labour women expressed irritation that she had somehow let the side down her position has however if anything strengthened since she topped the shadow cabinet elections ballot and mps note that by two of her three children with shadow chancellor ed balls will be teenagers might that be her moment one friend says shes still not completely sure yvette really wants to be leader she remains determined not to compromise family life but suspicion certainly lingers in the leaders circle with occasional petty skirmishes over limiting her influence she keeps up useful friendships has worked hard on developing a more relaxed public manner and is one of few in the old brownite camp to make friends on the labour right she would be the one to beat were ed miliband to fall under a bus tomorrow but with labour now riding high in the polls the chances of that happening are shrinking with every passing year it becomes more likely that coopers generation will be leapfrogged leaving someone else rachel reeves stella creasy to step into the breach but whatever happens to their own careers both may and cooper have arguably changed the terms of trade for younger women by showing that female politicians dont always have to compete on male terms margaret thatcher who once crowed that i owe nothing to womens lib famously triumphed despite her gender the next woman leader may well do so because of hers,2013-03,cometh hour cometh woman rather woman seems wait three decade another plausible female prime minister two arrive theresa may yvette cooper locked horn last week immigration felt oddly like portent may come radically

efforts to get single parents off benefits and into jobs are failing because their needs are under the radar of the governments welfare to work schemes a study claims an assessment of both the work programme and job centre plus provision found that although single parents are promised personalised specialist support to help them into employment in practice they get only limited generic help that often fails to recognise their need for affordable childcare and flexible working official job outcome statistics show that a year into the work programme single parents were a third less likely less likely to get a sustainable job compared with other participant groups the study by the gingerbread charity says some single parents reported that they felt pressured by their job centre plus advisers towards a rapid return to work largely irrespective of the type of job and how this fitted with their experience work aims and caring responsibilities there were also concerns that rhetoric around personalised support also failed to match reality on the work programme for long term unemployed claimants the report states the work programme as it currently stands is not delivering the employment support that single parents and other claimants need to realise their work aspirations gingerbread chief executive fiona weir said securing a stable job with a decent wage is single parents best chance of lifting their families out of poverty but our research shows that the government cannot pretend its promise of personalised flexible employment support is even close to being delivered tailored support is the most effective way of helping single parents back to work and yet high targets and low budgets mean that advisers have neither the time nor resources to deliver this significant reform is required if single parents are to be supported into sustainable employment the gingerbread study interviewed single parents although these findings were illustrative they chimed with complaints made by parents to its helpline and matched findings of other research studies the charity said a spokesman for the department for work and pensions criticised what it called sweeping statements made by the study and said it was too early to judge the work programme work programme performance is already improving and the payment by results design means it only pays providers to get lone parents into jobs and keep them there he added a lone parent on jobseekers allowance will not be expected to take up a job if appropriate childcare is not available and their availability for work must take their childcare responsibilities into account kirsty mchugh chief executive of ersa which represents work programme providers said this research highlights some serious issues facing lone parents looking to get back to work work programme providers recognise many of the points highlighted in the report including lack of access to affordable childcare and the need for a smooth handover from jobcentre plus as the work programme continues providers are getting ever more effective at helping people back into employment it is therefore essential that expertise is shared to make the best quality support available to lone parents,2013-03,effort get single parent benefit job failing need radar government welfare work scheme study claim assessment work programme job centre plus

in somalia lul ali osman barake was sentenced to a year in jail after reporting rape by a gang of men in military fatigues she described being raped twice first by the military second by the judicial

sentenced to two and three years in jail respectively after reporting rape by strangers we are supporting their campaign to clear their names according to the independent police complaints commission it was policy in the southwark police specialist rape unit in to press women who reported rape to retract their allegations this was true of police rape units in at least four other london boroughs report february in the director of public prosecutions keir starmer said he would personally review each false rape allegation case before prosecuting a year later he decided the crown prosecution service was working effectively without his personal oversight yet rape victims continue to be prosecuted last week women against rape wrote to mr starmer about several other prosecutions including of women who were raped for years as children each of the cases contravenes the dpps guidance to prosecutors which are supposed to protect vulnerable women and girls teenagers women who have suffered domestic violence or have mental health problems it is a perversion of the law to prosecute rape victims while their rapists go free it prevents victims from coming forward and encourages rapists to attack again why is this being allowed on the dpps watch after all the apologies and the promises especially in the wake of savile and rochdale do we need an international outcry to get justice also

a police force is at the centre of six investigations into serious failings in the handling of domestic violence rape and sexual assault complaints the guardian can reveal victims say they were left at risk by fundamental errors by police in south wales in responding to their reports of violence the revelations again focus on alleged police mistakes and errors when dealing with violence against women and young people and come after recent criticism of the metropolitan polices sapphire sex crimes unit chief constables across wales and all four police and crime commissioners have been asked to attend meetings with tom davies commissioner for the independent police complaints commission ipcc in wales over his concerns that basic errors are still being made when dealing with allegations of sexual violence the investigations come after the deaths in of four women from domestic violence in wales in tragedies which resonated across the country and forced the police to face up to their mistakes in an attempt to stop another woman dying unnecessarily a national conference on domestic violence was held in june but within two years of its taking place the actions of the police in wales are again at the centre of a string of investigations five investigations into the force are being carried out by the ipcc the sixth is an inquiry by the south wales forces directorate of professional standards into a complaint from a victim of domestic violence that details of her allegations about abuse at the hands of her partner a south wales police officer were leaked to him by colleagues putting her at risk her request for an outside force to investigate has been refused the public are going to be greatly alarmed that we seem to be having a recurrence of failings in domestic violence cases and in one particular case in the licence and management of a man convicted of domestic violence and a serial sex offender said davies and it isnt the only investigation i am leading at the moment that involves the management of people with sex offences in their recent past it is just not good enough to give a trite phrase saying we will learn lessons if you dont learn the lessons and if you dont make sure on a regular basis that the lessons have filtered down to your officers some of the basic principles are not being adhered to and saying that the lessons have been learnt is beginning to ring hollow the independent investigations by the ipcc include an inquiry into how and why the force failed to monitor a rapist with a history of violent attacks on women who had been released from prison on licence the man christopher veal moved in with a woman in cardiff on his release from prison in august his girlfriend went to fairwater police station in the city and told officers that her partner had assaulted her but the officers sent the woman and her children home and took no further action the inquiry is examining why the officers did not appear to make even cursory checks that would have identified the suspect as a violent serial sex offender who had been in prison for rape two days later veal attacked the woman again with a claw hammer in an assault of such extreme violence she was hospitalised veal was then arrested and recalled to prison where he later killed himself the south wales force did not refer the case to the ipcc the watchdog only learned about it when the womans mp took up her complaint this year the fact that she and her children were allowed to return home where she was then subjected to a serious violent attack raises serious concerns said davies even more concerning is that the man was released from prison on licence and had a record of violence the guardian can reveal the four other inquiries focus on one area covered by the south wales force the northern command based in merthyr tydfil where there are not only concerns about complaints from women being ignored but also an investigation into whether two supervising officers covered up or were complicit in what was going on a detective sergeant from the command unit is at the centre of two inquiries into evidence that he failed to act on reports of rape and sexual assault one is investigating his failure to act on a report of the rape of an underage girl in march last year his actions were uncovered when the alleged perpetrator was investigated at a later date for other sexual assaults and rapes which he carried out after the first complaint to the detective sergeant the suspect has since been charged with three counts of sexual assault against three individuals which took place after the officer allegedly failed to act the same officer is under investigation for failing to take appropriate and timely action over allegations about the rape of another child despite four police forces providing information a man and a woman have now been charged with conspiracy to rape a child under and other offences relating to indecent images of children the officer has not been suspended within the same command unit in merthyr tydfil the ipcc has carried out another investigation into an officer who is charged with abusing his position to indecently assault women he met in the course of his duties laura richards a behavioural analyst who advised the association of chief police officers on domestic violence said there are some forces where culturally they are just not getting it you can be as process driven as you want but if you dont change your culture and if you dont understand that these offenders are manipulative and that you have to put them at the centre of your investigation then you will continue not to get it south wales assistant chief constable matt jukes said he recognised there would be public concern about the investigations but the force was committed to reducing domestic abuse we have introduced a range of measures to improve training and to ensure that incidents are properly managed and thoroughly investigated he said there are currently cases which have been voluntarily referred by south wales police to the ipcc for investigation the force continues to cooperate fully with these independent investigations none of which have reached their conclusions therefore it would be wrong to prejudge any findings although we recognise that these matters are of serious public concern victims who contacted police before their deaths four women who were killed in in wales had been in contact with police before their deaths north wales karen mcgraw killed by her former partner at her flintshire home ipcc said police should have done more to protect her gwent amp south wales joanna michael killed by her boyfriend despite dialing twice during the attack the ipcc said both police forces had failed her because of a fatal combination of technological and human errors gwent bobbie stokoe killed by her partner darryl smith her body was found later rolled up in carpet on wasteland ipcc found a gwent police control room operation had downgraded a call relating to her despite police knowing she was trying to escape a violent partner dyfed powys sasha jones killed by her father gary fisher the ipcc said previous concerns raised by her mother who contacted police times had not been dealt with properly by officers this article was amended on march to clarify that chief constables and police and crime commissioners in wales have been asked to attend meetings with the commissioner for the ipcc in wales rather than being called in,2013-03,police force centre six investigation serious

happy international womens day the postman called as he delivered the gas bill well done said the guy in the cafe where i live on the edge by eating bacon sandwiches i had already been woken up with its womens day mum is my school skirt clean of course none of thats true i didnt ever realise it was even happening until i went online but thats women for you scatty we get a special day and we dont even know about it possibly because in this country we dont know what its really for i have been bombarded with emails urging me to buy tickets to celebrate women at various events its a strange mixture of talking about female genital mutilation bad and then listening to some great women musicians good this vagueness is what doesnt appeal to me and reveals both real and symbolic powerlessness feminism is not an annual event but a daily practice sorry to be an awkward old trout but awkward old trout day would float my boat far more somehow it all feels rather patronising or perhaps matronising we are given these lists of whooshes of women who have achieved lady gaga oprah someone in africa of whom none of us have heard but that makes us feel a little better as someone who writes a lot about womens issues i find this incredibly reductive the complex multifaceted gains of many campaigners go unrecognised in the midst of a backlash against women with austerity being the excuse this all feels all way too cupcakey for me womens day originated from a strike in new york by garment workers leading to the setting up of the first trade union in america in russia alexandra kollontai persuaded lenin to make it an official holday but it wasnt until that it became an actual day off many other communist countries followed suit but somehow by turning it into a celebration it has become depoliticised once in italy i was given a bunch of mimosa on womens day as that is their tradition sort of valentiney italians you see adore and admire women whatever well flowers are nice breakfast in bed is nice and i will be having it on mothers day an end to domestic violence would be nice i see that that is the rather meaningless slogan for this year a promise is a promise time for action to end violence against women i dont know who made this promise but you cant argue with that any day of the year can you do we need to celebrate ourselves sure any time but to pretend this is some great feminist victory feels fake if womens day meant a public holiday i would be more excited instead it feels like a cosy exercise for a coterie of women with too much newage babbling not for cynical witches like me i dont doubt of course that in some parts of the world it signifies something much deeper but personally i would like a day off from feminism which gets exhausting but then thats the thing you dont get a day off from being a woman ever,2013-03,happy international womens day postman called delivered gas bill well done said guy cafe live edge eating bacon sandwich already

when the emergency services arrived at rebecca beatties home a trail of blood led to where she lay battered on the kitchen floor a day after he had promised to kill her if she left him her partner returned home to find her with friends attacking them and then repeatedly punching and kicking the mother of his son as she lay at his feet i remember having this overwhelming feeling that this was the end of my life this was it but then i thought of my son and decided it couldnt be the end i had to see him again she said later they told me that in the ambulance i was wailing this is not my life the war against domestic violence was meant to have been won with a decline in incidents since according to the british crime survey but in worrying new figures the charity citizens advice has reported a substantial increase in the number of people telling advisers they are victims the figures reveal that people of them women reported domestic violence to citizens advice last year there were reported incidents between october and december an increase on the same period the previous year although the figures should be treated with a degree of caution a spike in reports of domestic violence often considered to be a hidden crime can arise as women feel more able to report it citizens advice is sufficiently concerned to open specialist services for victims in of its uk offices these figures for domestic violence cases show it is disturbingly high and afflicts all levels of society it haunts the lives of too many women and children said gillian guy citizens advice chief executive calling on the prime minister to honour a promise made on international womens day to tackle the problem she added as the scale of government cuts start to bite we are concerned that our trend highlights how levels of domestic violence could get even worse we need to see the government doing everything it can to deal with the problems of violence against women in our society and ensure they get the support they need according to home office figures million women experienced domestic abuse last year in the uk including half a million victims of sexual assault there is a hidden epidemic of abuse undermining decades of progress in the womens liberation movement according to holly dustin of the end violence against women coalition these current scandals show that abuse of women and girls is still a massive problem for our society that we are only just starting to grapple with we need more than policy and procedures we need nothing less than a revolution in the way we think about this across every section of society she said new research from womens aid and refuge the largest provider of accommodation for domestic violence victims reveals that despite highprofile campaigns many women particularly teenagers do not know where to turn for help if they are being abused the organisations backed by avon which financed a survey of more than uk women found a third did not know where to seek support while among to yearolds the figure rose to in the same age group of respondents were not sure if excessive jealousy was a sign of domestic violence while could not say if punching was domestic violence a study from the nspcc found of teenage girls questioned believed that it was acceptable for a boyfriend to be aggressive towards his partner claire who is now was abused by her boyfriend from the age of but did not recognise that she was a victim of domestic abuse at first he would undermine her confidence and call her names hack into her emails and check her texts then came the physical abuse relentless kicks and punches always landing on areas of her body where bruising wouldnt show i didnt think domestic violence happened to teenagers i just thought it was something that happened to married couples she said i didnt really know what a healthy relationship was i suppose i had nothing to compare it to she firmly believes children should be taught about domestic violence i look back at all the pointless things i learned in school and just think they could have taught me this one key thing i think it would help so many people not get into bad relationships but also stop people causing them joanne wood who was abused by her partner from the age of was similarly unaware of what was happening to her not recognising that being forced to have sex was wrong id cry every time and he would do certain positions so he didnt have to see me cry she said he was my boyfriend so i didnt think it could be rape with only of to yearolds getting knowledge of domestic violence from school a total rethink of sex and relationship education was needed said sandra horley chief executive of refuge refuge and womens aid are struggling to make a difference but we cant do it on our own we need proper government funding and commitment to get sex and healthy relationships education into every school in the uk she said she added that of refuge services had been hit by funding cuts since the introduction of austerity measures finding a bed for an abused women is like gold dust she said these are worrying times for the domestic violence sector services are being eroded so it is time to call for a sea change and argue that prevention is better than cure the speaking out in her name campaign from refuge and womens aid is calling for statutory relationships education a move that has been blocked by the department for education according to stella creasy labour mp for walthamstow the government wants to leave it up to schools whether they teach children about relationships but i cant understand why in schools children will be guaranteed education about finance but not about consent she said i am worried the government does not understand the true costs of that choice a department for education spokesman said all schools were encouraged to provide a broad programme of sex and relationship education they must set an ageappropriate curriculum which best suits their pupils and consult with parents when drawing up sex and relationship education policies he said jeremy browne home office minister for crime prevention said domestic and sexual violence are dreadful crimes and we are serious about tackling the abuse suffered by women and girls across the country through our this is abuse campaign we have taken great strides in challenging unacceptable attitudes in teenage relationships and in helping teenagers to recognise abuse when they see it he added that the government had ringfenced nearly m until to help fund domestic and sexual violence support services rebecca who was abused from the age of until last year is now after the final attack left her needing reconstructive surgery on her face her boyfriend pleaded guilty to assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm and was jailed for months she specifically asked for her real name to be used in this article i want to show that i am not going to let him scare me any more hes not in control of my life she said i do feel safe now i am protected and i want other women to know you can leave an abusive relationship there is light at

tens of thousands of children living below the poverty line in some of the wealthiest parts of englands home counties may be unable to afford a proper lunch but fail to qualify for free school meals according to a study by the childrens society the charity urged the government to extend free school meals eligibility to more lowearning families who may be in fulltime jobs but struggle to get by its report found that this hidden poverty which was particularly concentrated in leafy areas of sussex surrey essex and buckinghamshire as well as london suburbs may reflect the higher prevalence in those areas of lowincome working families who are ineligible for free meals worth an average a year for each child a number of surveys over the past year back growing concerns among teachers and headteachers that austerity disproportionately hits lowincome families ability to cope with rising living costs increasing numbers of children are turning up to school without a lunch or the means to pay for one in of englands parliamentary constituencies more than of children living in poverty were either ineligible or failing to claim free school meals according to the childrens society data

arundel and south downs both and wycombe the childrens society wants free school meals for to be extended to all families receiving universal credit from october this at an estimated cost of m a year in england would lift children out of poverty and enable the government to keep child poverty targets on track matthew reed the charitys chief executive said it is shocking that huge numbers of children in poverty across the country are missing out on a free school meal every child in poverty should be entitled to this vital support we know from the families we work with up and down the country that parents are struggling to make ends meet right now the government is reconsidering which children will be entitled to get free school meals we urge the government to take this opportunity to make sure all children in poverty can get a free school meal families in england and wales with a child at a state school are normally entitled to receive free school meals if a parent works under hours a week hours for couples and if their annual income is less than the childrens society estimates that of million children living in poverty in england that miss out on a free school meal do so because they are ineligible the rest are believed not to take up the offer because they suffer stigma teasing or embarrassment or because their parents are unaware of it sharon hodgson mp labours shadow childrens minister said david cameron scrapped the rollout of free school meals to these families within days of taking office since then we have seen a decline in the number of breakfast clubs while teachers report more children arriving at school hungry and unable to concentrate linda cregan chief executive of the childrens food trust supported the call for free school meal entitlement to be extended to all families receiving universal credits she said evidence shows that when children eat better they do better in class poor diet and hunger have a marked detrimental impact on a childs ability to reach their full potential every pupil should be given the same chance to learn and achieve and thats why its so important that all children from families who receive universal credits should automatically qualify for free school meals if granted the next step would be to support schools in making sure these families register for them and take them the department for education estimates that proposals to extend free school meals to all children whose parents are in receipt of universal credit would mean that more than half of all children would receive free school meals at a cost of bn a year the dfe said no child should go hungry at school million of the most disadvantaged children currently claim a free nutritious meal at school every day some schools also provide breakfast clubs which offer free or subsidised meals to pupils from poorer families in addition the pupil premium which will increase to per pupil bn a year in targets extra money to ensure schools

eleven childrens charities have urged the government to reconsider the decision not to exempt foster carers from the controversial spare bedroom tax currently facing a legal challenge in the high court under the new rules due to come into effect on april fostered children will not be counted when assessing the number of occupants in a social housing property meaning carers will have their housing benefit reduced in an open letter to the work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith and the chancellor george osborne published on wednesday the charities claim some foster carers have reported receiving visits and letters from their local housing department saying they will have to move into smaller properties while the government has given m to the discretionary housing payment fund with m earmarked for foster carers to help people deemed to be in exceptional circumstances the charities say some people have been told they will not have access to it and others will not receive the full amount they lose in housing benefit the letter signed by the chief executives of the charities including fostering network barnardos and action for children says there is already a recruitment crisis in foster care with new foster carers needed across the uk and the government acknowledges and supports the urgent need to find more foster carers these new rules will make it even more difficult for people in social housing to become foster carers at a time when we urgently need more to come forward the government proposed these changes to address residential underoccupancy and to provide incentives for employment neither of these rationales is relevant to foster carers who are required to have a spare room in order to provide homes for vulnerable children the government is already facing a legal challenge from claimants including disabled and vulnerable children who want a judicial review of the new rules which stipulate housing benefit will only be payable on the basis that children under of the same gender will share a room and children under will share a room regardless of their gender a department for work and pensions spokesman said its fair that we ensure social housing is used appropriately and that the state no longer pays for people to live in homes too big for their needs however weve provided m to councils to ensure that groups like foster carers

real terms over the last years the government plans to make childcare less expensive by relaxing the number of preschool children that nurseries and registered childminders can oversee but the report

michael goves adoption revolution is in danger of moving too far too fast while failing to provide enough vital support to parents who take on emotionally abused and neglected children a lords legislative committee has warned headed by former senior family court judge lady butlersloss it says the education secretarys reforms should not focus solely on adoption at the expense of other suitable forms of permanent care for children and insists the desire to increase the number of adoptions should not override vital social work aimed at keeping atrisk birth families together the committee argues that unless the government moves to ensure all local authorities have a legal duty to provide further financial support to families more will run the risk of experiencing adoption breakdown the peers welcome the governments steps to improve the adoption system particularly attempts to cut delays that mean on average a child waits two and half years from entering care to being adopted however the committee which was tasked with providing official prelegislative scrutiny of the governments draft adoption proposals published in november warns that more speed will not on its own deliver the stability that youngsters in care desperately need and more must be done to ensure the right outcomes for children the department for education said on tuesday night that it would consider the committees recommendations and respond in due course a spokesman added we make no apologies for wanting children to be offered loving homes quickly it currently takes almost two years to place a child denying them routine stability and the opportunity to bond with their parents writing in the guardian butlersloss says ongoing support for families is vital because so many adopted children have complex behavioural and emotional needs as a result of their early experiences where the government has sadly failed to grasp the nettle is in providing postadoption support to parents and children to allow them to make a lasting lifelong success of their new families often these needs do not become apparent until adolescence years after an adoption has taken place adoptive parents face challenges that other families do not and they deserve support at present local authorities must provide an assessment of the support needs of adopted children but have no obligation to provide support butlersloss calls this a nonsense although the governments children and families bill includes a clause that would allow local authorities to give adopters a personal budget to help them with support this is merely optional butlersloss warns this has the potential to worsen the current postcode lottery although providing adoptive parents with a personal budget would be costly at a time when council childrens services budgets are being squeezed butlersloss argues that investing in ensuring adoptive families can stay together would save the taxpayer money a spokesman for the department for education said some local authorities were better than others at making postadoption support available for families it said it planned in a few weeks time to publish an adoption passport which would set out what support adopters are entitled to from their local council the committee found there was no clear evidence how many children reentered the care system after adoption breakdown estimates range from to its unacceptable that there is no robust data collection to support this particularly given the governments prioritisation of adoption writes butlersloss this is the second time in a matter of months that the lords committee on adoption legislation has questioned goves adoption proposals shortly before christmas it issued an interim report in which it rubbished

david cameron has long had a problem with women from the early days of the coalition most have balked at his government and its austerity programme that hits women hardest along with the prime ministers patronisingly tinear calm down dear gestures but just as the coalition struggle over plans for yet more budget cuts is reaching fever pitch that problem is becoming critical labours lead over the conservatives among women has now hit to according to the most recent icmguardian poll compared with a lead among men no wonder tory strategists are panicking some pundits have played down the icm figure as a rogue result based on small samples but women have been backing labour over the tories by margins well into double figures since last autumn and its not just in party support that theres a glaring gender gap on a wide range of issues from cuts in pensions benefits health and education to tax increases on the rich women in britain are not only strongly opposed to coalition policies theyre often significantly more hostile to them than men while both men and women back a mansion tax for example twothirds of women support it compared with of men and it is not hard to see why women are bearing the brunt of the coalitions austerity onslaught in the week of international womens day which was set up to campaign for womens rights and freedoms these are being undermined and reversed by camerons coalition it is women who make up of the public sector and over threequarters of the workforce of the nhs and local government who are taking the full force of what is now planned to be more than a million public service jobs cuts by that will also widen the gender pay gap which is seven points bigger in the private sector women are losing out disproportionately from pay caps and freezes tax credit maternity pay legal aid and benefit cuts and make up of those hit by januarys child benefit cut as the fawcett society puts it together these changes spell a tipping point for womens equality this government is making women pay above all for the bankers crisis but the shift in womens attitudes goes far beyond a reaction to the assault from cameron and george osborne women in britain are now significantly to the left of men and more socially liberal on most key political controversies of the day they are not only more committed to public services the welfare state and progressive taxation they are also on average more egalitarian less racist and homophobic more committed to the environment and much more hostile to british warmaking only a quarter backed the invasion of iraq years ago compared with a third of men while most women also opposed british military operations in libya and mali against a minority of men it wasnt always like this women have been more antiwar than men for decades but for most of the past century they were consistently more conservative than men and regularly helped put the tories in power after all women finally won the vote in in the s the conservative gender gap was but over the past generation there has been a sea change women have moved to the left almost across the board and have now leapfrogged over men the differences might seem relatively small though on issues of war and peace theyre usually around women tend to identify less with political parties and the shift is offset by the fact that women live longer and older people tend to be more conservative the direction of travel is however unmistakable and its far from restricted to britain the trend for women to shift leftwards has been clear longest in the united states where a higher proportion of women than men have voted democrat in presidential elections since and where barack obama was reelected with of the overall womens vote the same pattern was already evident across most advanced industrial economies a decade ago as the academics pippa norris and ronald inglehart found while mens politics had remained pretty stable womens had moved left from the s onwards and they were also far less likely to vote for parties of the far right crucial to the shift has been the growth of womens employment often segregated in lowwage and public sector work and the decline of the traditional family and churches in europe but also the rise of the womens movement and the influence of feminism the importance of paid work in changing womens politics is one reason why there hasnt been a parallel shift in much of the developing world in britain women now make up half the trade union movement and have played a central role in recent industrial action from the mass pensions strike of to cleaners walkouts on the london underground but the central role of women in the arab uprisings or the protest movement against sexual violence in india demonstrates there are no western boundaries to womens political mobilisation and common causes as the feminist writer gloria steinem commented recently more american women have been killed by their husbands or boyfriends since than all us citizens killed in and the iraq and afghanistan wars put together of course womens move leftwards shouldnt be overstated there has been no shortage of warmongering and reactionary women in positions of power and class and ethnicity both cut across and shape gender attitudes but no amount of coalition party posturing about repackaged childcare subsidies is going to win back their lost female voters the convulsive industrial change of recent decades cut the ground from beneath traditional maledominated labour movements but more than a century after international womens day was established by the left and later triggered the outbreak of the russian revolution womens changing politics and workplace role are already laying the ground for new forms of communitybased solidarity in the words of frances ogrady the first woman leader of the trades union congress this shift can be the foundation of a new left project for women as well

adoption has changed fifty years ago it was a way to provide a home for a baby born out of wedlock in there were adoptions nearly all of illegitimate children adoption today is different the improved availability of contraception the legalisation of abortion and the change in societal attitudes to single mothers have combined to reduce significantly the number of babies given up for adoption in there were only babies out of a total of children adopted children available for adoption today are mainly those in care many of them have experienced abuse or neglect before being removed from their birth families and may have suffered the disruption of moving between temporary placements a great deal is known now about the importance for children of early relationships the effects of emotional abuse and neglect are cumulative pervasive and farreaching and are particularly severe in very young children that damage is often compounded by the instability of frequent moves in care but with the right care and support a maltreated child can recover most important it is permanence and thereby the ability to form secure attachments that provides the best means to recovery adoption is one important but not the only route to achieving it the government is determined to improve adoption services to ensure that more children are adopted and more quickly there is much that could be improved about the adoption process not least the almost endemic delay which means that on average a child will wait over two and a half years from entering care to being adopted it is a cruel fact of life that with each year that a child remains in care the likelihood of being adopted shrinks further in adoption speed really does matter while greater urgency is undoubtedly needed within adoption services this will not on its own ensure the stability that children in care desperately need the government has acknowledged that adoption is more challenging and more complicated than in the past certainly more so than when michael gove was adopted where the government has sadly failed to grasp the nettle is in providing postadoption support to parents and children to allow them to make a lasting lifelong success of their new families it is vital that this support is provided because of their early life experiences adopted children have a range of complex behavioural and emotional needs which are not wiped out simply as a result of being adopted often these needs do not become apparent until adolescence many years after an adoption has taken place adoptive parents face challenges that other families do not and they deserve support to help them care for their children at present local authorities are required by law to provide an assessment of the support needs of adopted children and their parents but they are not required to provide the support once those needs have been assessed this is a nonsense parents adopting children from care have the capacity to transform childrens lives but they may need help in dealing with the extra challenges they face access to counselling parenting courses and less formal support such as parent networks dropin sessions and kids clubs can help to secure placement stability as well as crucially encouraging more adopters to come forward the children and families bill before the house of commons includes a clause that would allow local authorities to give adopters a personal budget with which to buy the services they believe their children require this provision however would be optional the bill does not unfortunately create a new duty to provide support this has the potential to worsen the current postcode lottery that applies to postadoption support on wednesday the lords committee on adoption legislation which i have been chaireding for the last nine months argues for a new duty on local authorities and other commissioning bodies to ensure this provision in these times of economic austerity it is hard to argue for more services at the taxpayers expense but adoption saves the state a lot of money children in care cost an average of a year many children with disabilities or special needs cost far more that cost is removed from the public purse when a child is adopted the cost of providing support to adoptive families needs to be balanced therefore against the cost of continuing to maintain children in local authority care sadly some adoptions break down and those children reenter the care system we do not know how many adopted children this affects estimates range from to but its unacceptable that there is no robust data collection to support it we on the committee believe adoption should be for life providing essential postadoption support is the best way of ensuring that it is,2013-03,adoption ha changed fifty year ago wa way provide home baby born wedlock adoption nearly illegitimate child adoption today different improved availability contraception

today id like to talk about the fourth wave of feminism but dont worry thats for later first im going to talk about milfs youve heard of the term milf right of course you have everyone has even milfs know it which goes to show how wellworn the term must be what with mothers generally being so passe and unattractive yet some rare few miraculously slip through the ugly net and know how to do things like buy jeans and use acronyms theyre so modern those milfs but for those poor unfortunates who fail the milf test dont cry into your mamps cardigan a new book has just been published the milf diet which promises to help mothers improve their milfification and to provide succour to all women aged to who have been waiting the last two thousand years to get our sexuality back two thousand years its amazing any conception happened at all an interview with the author jessica porter ran in a british broadsheet on monday and was as full of baloney as the diet itself is full of wholegrains which porter claims gillian mckeithstyle literally have intelligence a claim that begs the snark well comparatively perhaps if you are desirous of losing weight seek out this interview because while i cannot say from experience whether fermented foods really will make you resemble halle berry porter has an obsession with celebrities that seems ever so slightly at odds with her keen insistence that milfs work on their higher self i can say for certain that it will put you off your lunch which is a start right quarterbaked diet books especially ones aimed at women come out every day but porters tome utterly unwittingly touches on something even less appetising than a macrobiotic diet which incidentally is all the milf diet is with a side order of eckhart tolle it has been obvious for some time that while motherhood is still urged on women by society as the only truly happy path for them any physical indication of what motherhood let alone pregnancy and childbirth entails is shunned even aside from those ridiculous tabloid spreads cooing about how soon a celebrity gets back into her skinny jeans after birth there are salons that urge women to get brazilian waxes before giving birth magazine articles explaining how to coordinate lactating breasts with sex and guidelines on how soon you can have sex after birth for the record i am not a mother and neither unsurprisingly is porter which perhaps explains how she has the time to find so many japanese vegetables so for all i know getting all of her pubic hair ripped out with hot wax is precisely what a ninemonth pregnant woman craves right before expelling a human through her vagina it certainly was what avowed feminist heather wood rudulph sought before she had her baby a choice she recounts in detail in her new cowritten book sexy feminism which is based on the website of the same name i just like being taken care of down there its one less thing to worry about in the ongoing maintenance routine that is a womans life she writes somewhat contradictorily before then going on to explain that having a brazilian wax before giving birth is practical because grooming a vagina still recovering from birth trauma not fun both rudulph and porter suggest their lifestyle choices are in some way feminist ever since mary played the immaculate card in bethlehem our culture has been struggling with a fundamental split women are unconsciously perceived as either good girls or goodtime girls either naughty or nice but suddenly we can be mothers and be considered frisky in the bedroom gushes porter rudulph meanwhile writes about her pubic hair care i feel just a little empowered knowing that i am making this decision for myself now lets talk a little about feminisms fourth wave which is currently in its early stages one of the most important elements to the movement in its current form is a lack of judgment about other womens lives this is of course welcome no one needs to go back to a time when a prominent female journalist would write when the sex war is won prostitutes should be shot as collaborators for their terrible betrayal of all women women can and should do whatever they want but that does not mean every choice a woman makes is feminist in itself in regards to motherhood expectations of women seem to have come full circle from the s when wives were expected to look sexy and be available for their husbands and households almost instantly after birth but now the difference is it is styled up as a modern even feminist choice ditto for a woman being judged purely on her desirability as for sexuality if a woman dearly wants to go out in her underwear or sporting a hat thats really made for fiveyearolds or if a female celebrity honestly feels the best way to celebrate her alist status is to pose basically naked in a mens magazine then she should go forth and do so but while the choosing may be feminist that does not mean the choice is feminism as a movement is about establishing equality for women socially economically and politically brazilian waxes in which a woman endures physical pain to obtain the genitals of a prepubescent dont really fit in there and thats ok a woman does not have to behave in a fully feminist way all of the time or even any of the time if she doesnt want to but whats not ok is to use the term as a fig leaf excusing all of a womans choices after all if a woman really is such a feminist she can stand up for her own damn self,2013-03,today id like talk fourth wave feminism dont worry thats later first im going talk

two out of three local authorities in england and wales are failing to provide enough childcare to support parents who work according to figures to be published this week for families with disabled children the picture is even bleaker with only one in seven local authorities meeting their statutory duties to ensure they have enough childcare provision in the childcare costs survey the newly merged charities the daycare trust and the family and parenting institute say the situation is increasing pressure on already struggling families and preventing parents who want to work staying in their jobs the group said the failure by local authorities to meet their responsibilities under the childcare act designed to encourage parents back into the workplace was almost entirely due to funding shortages anand shukla chief executive of the organisation said at a time when one in five children lives in poverty the failure to provide this essential service for parents who want to provide for their families is a national scandal the figures show that only one in five local authorities in england reports having enough provision for parents with children under two and only one in seven say there is enough care for disabled children research by the department for work and pensions has shown that a third of parents who do not currently work say it is because of the unaffordability of childcare councils are failing families said shukla its no wonder we are struggling to find economic growth when parents are held back from doing more by a lack of accessible and affordable childcare not only is childcare vital for child development and the wellbeing of families but it is central to economic growth in a modern economy childcare providers in many less wealthy areas rely on funding from local authorities and many point to the financial squeeze as exacerbating differences in quality and availability of care for parents in different areas across britain childcare costs are already rising at above inflation rates while there have been deep cuts in tax credits and child benefit amid much controversy the government has indicated it plans to reduce the adulttochild ratios to ease the pressure on nurseries childminders and afterschool clubs but the daycare trust and the family and parenting institute argues that there will be little or no impact on costs for parents staffing costs are just one part of a complex picture so allowing adults to look after more children at once is not only a risky idea but doesnt seem to provide any cost savings shukla said with private and nonprofit childcare providers struggling i doubt whether parents will ever see any of the money saved by increasing the numbers of children per staff member the charity which will publish its report on wednesday is calling for more government support to local authorities the childcare act obliges all english and welsh local authorities to ensure there is enough childcare for working parents and those undertaking training and education with a view to returning to work,2013-03,two three local authority england wale failing provide enough childcare support

consciousness raising the cornerstone of s feminist activism can now be found online its never been easier to tap feminism into google and find a cacophony of voices bringing home that jarring realisation that gendered inequality is a worldwide phenomenon its what i did four years ago when i first stumbled across the f word a website with content that would change my perceptions of gender forever online feminism is free instant and accessible a mass of thriving divergent opinions the beautiful thing about feminism online is that you dont just hear from the same people who have somehow unofficially been crowned feminisms official representatives online feminism means the people in the mainstream media no longer get to set the perimeters of debate instead there is a rich melting pot of voices who have never before been given a platform there are sex workers passionately opposing the narratives that assume that their mere existence threatens womens liberation there are black women like me making the case for intersectionality bridging those tensionfilled gaps between feminism and antiracism there are transgender women rejecting assertions that their existence is a threat to feminisms progress for many disabled feminists and disabled activists in general online activism can tackle the question of accessibility particularly when demonstrations and events fail to provide it feminism is not dogma and it has no leaders its a place not just for questioning power structures but for questioning each other a place to grow and learn and change every voice levels the playing ground but we should never underestimate the power of the written word in hard copy the return of spare rib is exciting because apart from the odd transgression feminist politics arent often found in womens magazines as well as articles the magazine served as a noticeboard for feminist events and activism a significant development of online feminism has been the exploration of the intersecting and complex factors that contribute to a structurally and institutionally unequal society with those factors including but not limited to gender this conversation might be recent but its nothing new ive got a copy of spare rib from september nestled among my books with a front page dedicated to black women rising against racism and police harassment articles about sex workers on hunger strike and coverage of working class female factory workers challenging their employers with the sex discrimination act the magazine was nothing if it wasnt intersectional the modernday spare ribs challenge will be to take the existing sparks of stimulating online feminist discussion and produce a monthly glossy that can compete with glamour and grazia it seems preemptive to so keenly anticipate the coming of a magazine that is yet to hit printing presses but if spare rib can emulate the thriving diversity of feminism online interactive creating debates democratising the creation of content it will have a bright future the feminist blogger sianushka puts it eloquently when she says feminists organising online are doing this as a labour of love with little to no financial reward executed carefully with attention paid to elevating marginalised voices the return of spare rib might just redress that balance,2013-04,consciousness raising cornerstone feminist activism found online never easier tap

the police are dealing with as many as one in eight violent offences including knife crimes and domestic violence by getting the offender to apologise to the victim rather than prosecuting them in court according to house of commons research the shadow home secretary yvette cooper says that freedom of information act requests show a steep rise in the number of serious crimes being dealt with by community resolution methods such as restorative justice since a cut in whitehall grants to the police began to bite in the house of commons library figures show that up to of recorded violent offences are being dealt with in this way by some forces instead of being prosecuted in the courts the number of cases has risen from in to in and reached last year the figures include offences involving serious injury being dealt with in this way community resolution including restorative justice where the offender is brought face to face with their victim is supposed to be used as an alternative to prosecution for lowlevel criminal damage lowvalue thefts minor assaults without injury or antisocial behaviour association of chief police officers guidelines say they should only be used for less serious offences where the offender accepts responsibility the victim has been consulted and the offender has no relevant past offending history offences dealt with in this way do not carry a criminal record or lead to an entry on the police national computer cooper said the evidence showed that the use of restorative justice can be very effective in tackling antisocial behaviour and lowlevel crime but the evidence and acpo guidance are very clear that these should not be used for serious crimes and should not be used for domestic violence at all to do so risks giving community resolutions a bad name the house of commons library figures show that community resolutions were used to resolve offences of domestic violence in in those forces that responded to the foi requests the practice is highest in derbyshire manchester and the west mercia forces cooper said that ministers had allowed the situation to develop as the result of cuts to resources it is no coincidence that this big increase in community resolutions for serious crime comes at the same time as police officers being lost the police are doing less with less and justice for serious crimes and vulnerable victims is being put at risk she said the home secretary theresa may should issue strong guidance setting out when community resolutions should be used the idea that perpetrators of domestic violence are being let off for things like saying sorry to the victim is very disturbing and risks perpetuating the abuse,2013-04,police dealing many one eight violent offence including knife

one thing about getting older is that it becomes easier to drown out unwanted noise to trim the fat from your life the slow buses sweet drinks pinchy shoes and most importantly the places and people that make you feel uncomfortable as an adult its rare that i have to go to a rappers and slappers night its rare that i have to walk down brightons north street in a vest at am and rarer still that i have to do it in the company of people carrying pint glasses of vomit wearing wigs made of turf singing the moonpig jingle but i can remember the feeling well and i can remember how even though everything in me wanted to walk very fast through the crowd down to the quiet of the seafront i would ride on this wave of beer and banter for another year because this was what being a student was this pokeintheribs of a life a long car ride between people who hate you but then in time i found my people and escaped to the seafront and discovered under the banter the beach i fear though that in the years since i was a student its become harder to escape that laddy life is so suffocating in fact that the nus was moved to investigate it and in its recent report on lad culture there are stories that are as sinister as they are depressing its less the stories of overt harassment and abuse that are upsetting and that appear to be the overwhelming problem in universities but more the fast undertow of disdain of women of difference and of education itself the stories particularly of female students being silenced in class told to calm down the nus defines lad culture as a subset of student life that promotes one particular masculinity one expressed through hard drinking and hard bantering one that normalises sexual harassment one that exaggerates this masculinity in the face of a threat to it even though those who participate are in a minority because they run the nighttimes theyre a minority that dominates student life and its a serious problem when this overwhelms all other student cultures and this is how cultures work they overlap and change and influence each other people dip in and out of them but they alter situations scent it like lynx sprayed in through the vents it puts women in danger it pushes them backwards another nus report found that one in seven students has been the victim of a serious assault but only told the police this is a culture problem an environment where rape is the punchline to a hundred shit jokes where as quoted in last months report boys making rape jokes on buses laugh dont worry ladies none of us have been convicted yet though its a social thing a beery leery nighttime thing lad culture feeds into the classrooms where policy changes and the endorsement of individualism mean laddish masculinities have been bolstered competition for instance noisiness i see why lad culture and its associated terms are hard to take seriously because its a gentle word whose meaning has mutated in its lightness though it speaks of an attitude of intimidation and modern sexism the solution then isnt to target the boys behind sites like unilad who after i wrote about them last year fired over reams of emails calling me frigid and ugly hi guys or to enforce as has been discussed a zero tolerance policy on pimps and hoes nights and similar its to try to wobble the dominating culture by pointing out that its one of many that it is challengeable speakupagainstable so that students realise when they feel themselves riding that banterous wave down north street that its possible to swim against it and if not to roll off down a

out with the old in with the new or the not so new last week more magazine that cheeky aunt with her sex tips boy obsession and embarrassing anecdotes folded after years and in its place well it emerged later in the week that groundbreaking feminist magazine spare rib will return journalist charlotte raven has announced plans to breathe life back into the brand emailing friends and potential backers to obtain the needed to get the biannual print edition going the website though just a holding page at the moment has all the funds to get going immediately despite the premise seeming niche youll rarely see spare rib without the radical feminism caveat raven also promises that the print incarnation will sit alongside cosmo on the newsagents shelf but what will its place be on the internet though spare rib really couldnt come at a better time its rough terrain out there whether its through writer caitlin moran femen slutwalks grimess tumblr account indias antirape protests or sheryl sandberg feminism is having a resurgence all right but when it lives on the internet where lazy clicks equal approval retweets supersede debate feminism is twisting and turning in on itself i know its selfperpetuating to point out that a fault of feminism is that its constantly criticised by women who dont accept other definitions of feminism but how are we radical or modern day as beyonc so controversially put it feminists all of us meant to topple inequality if we cannot treat each other equally though the internet has been fertile ground for a new wave of feminism to take root for every website such as everyday feminism which simply holds a magnifying mirror to the regular dull throb of misogyny so it can be identified and extracted like a thick whitehead theres a website such as vagenda here paying women for their writing is brushed aside in favour of tearing apart the work of women who are employed by womens magazines take their kneejerk gloating over mores closure where around mostly female staff were made jobless but maybe my feeling that women should be paid for the work they can get is just as strong as the girls who felt more wasnt instilling them with body confidence the unfortunate truth is that while the internet has united minorities it has not brought down the tower of babel the concept of a free platform to speak to the world should be a force for good and in so many cases it is but when it comes to feminism the internet has democratised but fractured opinion maybe this is where spare rib can have some authority the brands legacy is one of a time when women achieved change through genuine activism not idle clicktivism with the knowledge and experience of those who achieved some liberation in the s but with the modern savviness to use a kickstarterstyle format to launch it seems to have the balance right i hope spare rib doesnt fall victim to the internets dissections and preference for immediate reaction instead of thoughtout

government proposals to alter the childcare ratios in nursery schools are turning into a fiasco despite universal opposition from both parents and practitioners the minister behind the strategy liz truss continues to trot out the same old baseless arguments she says that its the qualification of childcare staff not the number of staff that matters but common sense will tell you that even the highestqualified practitioner only has one pair of hands and one pair of eyes the consequences of her actions will surely come back to haunt us children will suffer physically and emotionally she says that the government has consulted on these proposals rubbish perhaps the minister can explain why as the largest membership organisation representing around providers and the largest voluntary operator of childcare in areas of deprivation we were not one of the organisations she claims to have consulted before launching this ridiculous policy perhaps she was already aware of our members position on the matter the more great childcare consultation about childcare ratio changes was a sham at no point were the sector or parents asked if they thought ratio relaxation was a good idea instead the consultation asked how best these changes could be implemented how biased and distorted is that the minister says that the new ratios are voluntary tell that to childcare providers based in deprived areas where it is proved that children need the most onetoone care who face the choice of either cramming in more children in a desperate attempt to lower fees and stay competitive or risk closing and abandoning the families they support last autumn the preschool learning alliance consulted with more than day nurseries and preschools about ratio changes and said they would not be able to provide the same quality of care if ratios were relaxed said they would be unlikely to lower their childcare fees even if they relaxed the ratios with many citing a desire to improve staff wages the consequence of ratio changes will be a reduction in the overall quality of childcare in this country we will see the emergence of a twotier childcare sector with more prosperous areas retaining the current ratios because parents can afford the higher fees while nurseries in disadvantaged areas will either be forced to close or relax ratios to take more children in order to remain solvent is it a coincidence that current childcare ratios are found to be restrictive and unnecessary at the same time that the government is desperately trying to ensure that it can actually deliver on its promise of places for disadvantaged twoyearolds by september with another places needed by next year the government has admitted that there is currently a shortfall of places increasing the number of children per childcare worker by up to seems like a very easy way of creating more places without the need for any additional government investment neil leitch is chief executive of the preschool

last chance for local authorities to attract more adopters reads the headline on a department for education press release published in january announcing a new strategy to tackle the chronic shortage of adopters and the systemic failings in recruitment it warns that if councils cant show how they will recruit more adopters the government wont hesitate to take away parts of adoption services from local authority control however the association of directors of childrens services adcs which at the time dubbed the proposed shakeup heavyhanded and unnecessary is publishing data on wednesday that it says proves local authorities are doing much better than the threat to outsource adoption recruitment to private agencies and charities suggests crucially says the adcs the figures are up to date those the government relied on in january were from march and cover out of local authorities in england at the end of march this year the number of children waiting for adoption had fallen over the previous months from to those matched with a family were up by from to what were seeing is a picture that shows the system has been responding better than the governments lagging figures had suggested says adcs president andrew webb this provides really firm evidence that the solution being proposed by ministers is neither appropriate nor in any way necessary given that local authorities recruit of adopters anyway to take us out of the market as a way of improving the market seems like a flawed logic the dfes january pronouncement said local authorities responsibility to their own children meant there was no incentive to recruit adopters to meet the national shortage but the adcs report finds many councils are collaborating regionally to share pools of approved adoptive families some are also working together on other areas such as joint recruitment and marketing campaigns the largest decrease in percentage terms in the number of children waiting was in the eastern region bedford cambridgeshire central bedfordshire essex hertfordshire luton norfolk peterborough southendonsea suffolk and thurrock where the number fell by in essex which placed children in compared with the year before head of adoption stephanie bishop puts some of the local authoritys success down to a system of adopterled matching introduced in the last year prospective adopters are shown dvds of waiting children from the start of the assessment process giving them the chance to build connections and they meet their foster carers so that a match may be ready to be made as soon as adopters are approved in the last financial year immediate matches were made for out of the approved families its been very positive bishop says,2013-04,last chance local authority attract adopter read headline department

conviction rates for rape and domestic violence cases have risen to an all time high the director of public prosecutions dpp has revealed amid criticism that too few cases are being brought to court figures released by the crown prosecution service show that the conviction rate for rape prosecutions has increased to the highest on record from in to in the cps figures on rape are expressed as a percentage of cases where charges were brought and flagged as involving rape in raw figures there were prosecutions for rape last year resulting in convictions the conviction rate for domestic violence has also increased by in the past year to in it stood at there were cases last year resulting in convictions and acquittals but keir starmer qc has had to defend the cpss record in response to criticism from the shadow attorney general emily thornberry that too many perpetrators were walking free cps figures have shown that prosecutions in england and wales for violence against women and girls have risen from around cases in to in thornberry the labour mp for islington south and finsbury asked questions in parliament about how many rape and domestic violence cases referred to the cps did not result in prosecutions the figures she obtained show that for domestic violence the proportion of cases where the cps took no further action remain remarkably consistent despite an overall rise in numbers in domestic violence cases were passed to the cps but resulted in no further action being taken four years later in police passed on cases of which end up with the cps recommending no charges again i am disappointed that the proportion of domestic violence cases where no action at all is taken remains stubbornly high thornberry said given that the cps has rightly made violence against women and girls a priority i would have expected this proportion to fall she added thornberry said some progress has been made with rape prosecutions but the fact that one in two cases are not taken up at all still seems very high the cps recently carried out a very important study of false allegations of rape and domestic violence and found they were extremely rare this points to the sad conclusion that the vast majority of the rape and domestic violence cases that the cps is not acting on are genuine and the perpetrators are walking freedomestic violence cases result in more retractions more than any other offence he explained a relatively high number of victims will not want to pursue the case or will retract given its in the context of a relationship and there are children involved what we have done to try and deal with that is build cases on the assumption that the victim may not support it in the end we encourage the police to get the early evidence that would allow us to do that one of the critical things is a copy of the tape and record better videos of the scene where we get that combination we can pursue a case even if the victim says she doesnt want to support it and that helps drive up the figures on rape starmer said the statistics partially reflect the fact that once a case was flagged as rape it would not necessarily be recorded as a success if it ended up being charged as a different offence we are doing all we can to prosecute rape cases but there are a number of challenges he said rape often takes place in a private setting where the victim is the only witness but it does mean that victims will almost always have to go to court we can offer special measures but some victims decide they are not prepared to go to court and face down the person they say is the assailant many perpertrators target vulnerable victims and that may mean these are people who find it especially difficult to deal withe the criminal justice system starmer said that a correlation could not be drawn between few rape allegations bering false yet almost half of police cases not resulting in charges a case may fall for a whole host of evidential reasons starmer explained a lot of victims dont want to pursue cases and there may be issues of identity but i can see why thats a legitimate question to ask thornberry also suggested funding cuts may be undermining progress starmer admitted he was having to make extensive savings of notwithstanding the significant saving we are making starmer said we are improving,2013-04,conviction rate rape domestic violence case risen time high director public prosecution dpp ha revealed amid criticism case brought court figure released crown prosecution service

the childcare minister elizabeth truss is worried that the nations toddlers spend too much time in nurseries running about with no sense of purpose she doesnt say exactly what kind of purpose shed expect a twoyearold to pursue but commends structured play politeness and obedience to a teacher nurseries apparently are the place where human beings must stop being uncontrolled bundles of drives and become biddable members of society if they dont arrive at infant school able to subordinate their wishes and feelings to a higher order then something must be wrong and why should we give tax breaks to the parents of wild beasts of course its true that human development generally involves a process of becoming more and more controlled you gradually learn to tell yourself what to do and to do as youre told then if youre very very good you end up in a job where you can tell other people what to do and if youre totally perfect you can become a government minister and boss people around en masse however if you arent processed correctly you may live your whole life flailing around lashing out at whoevers available and probably expecting the government to pay you while youre about it unless you are a rich and famous footballer like luis suarez who runs around very purposefully but also bites his opponents occasionally because he clearly hasnt incorporated the rules of politesse at a deep enough level where did he go to nursery while it obviously wouldnt be wise to argue for a state where children are allowed to do whatever they like its also sad to think that the period of life during which we might exercise at least a bit of freedom from crushing social constraints may become even shorter being silly and uninhibited rather than being a fundamental part of growing up and beyond risks becoming a behavioural issue to be resolved as quickly and efficiently as possible the suggestion is that we live in a society thats so totally broken up by untrammelled impulses of the sort that cause people to have messy love lives and set their children on fire that we must urgently apply restraining measures to the little ones who can still be saved in time to grow up to be rightthinking automatons according to truss the french have a far better system where preschool children are given structured lessons and are expected to sit quietly take turns and address their leaders correctly curiously one of the key features of the french system is that they employ graduates rather than wellmeaning women who dont mind working for peanuts this is great for the toddlers because they are given the chance to be subdued by people who are themselves contained enough to have sat still through whole lectures on derrida and levistrauss whats missing from trusss recommendations and from the entire tory mindset as far as i can tell is any mention of kindness or enjoyment not to mention interestingness what if nurseries were run by people who really knew how to engage children people who made the children laugh who the children really liked i dont think its a weird thing to expect my daughter went to a nursery like that staterun in the middle of a south london housing estate and shes still notably unwayward years on like almost every utterance issuing from our dear leaders whom i would not wish to address correctly if they walked into the room trusss ideas about nurseries parade as common sense but are in fact yet more patronising authoritarian claptrap whose key result would be to increase our overall misery,2013-04,childcare minister elizabeth

she finds it hard to believe now but when ellen was punched in the throat by her new boyfriend she wondered whether the attack might have been her fault he leapt up and hit me with the ball of his hand and began yelling at me she says and i remember standing there gasping for breath and asking myself whether it was me did i do something wrong the thought of anyone attacking ellen is unnerving she is a petite yearold artist weve met at her studio in manchester i was terrified she remembers all i had done was put a blanket over him when he fell asleep on my couch and there he was threatening me and shouting i kept asking him to leave she continues before he could hurt me again and eventually i got him out but i was left wondering whether it was just a bad reaction to being woken up i thought there was something wrong with him but you cant help asking whether its you was it your fault although she sometimes looks a little fragile ellen has a ready smile and an appealing line in selfdeprecation in her studio her vibrant paintings betray nothing of a troubled past i had been in a violent relationship years before and that just contributed to my uncertainty she explains you lose confidence in yourself in your choices and your ability to recognise people who could be bad for you until six months ago women in ellens position have had to rely on their own judgement but last september a oneyear home office experiment called the domestic violence disclosure scheme was rolled out in greater manchester wiltshire nottingham and gwent that enables victims such as ellen to ask the police if the person in their life has a history of domestic violence a friend told me about the scheme and so i plucked up the courage to walk into a police station and ask the question she says i had to know the truth about this man and whether i should give him another chance what she found was potentially lifechanging the boyfriend had a long history of abuse harassment and violence against women he was a serial abuser and i probably would have been the next person he abused says ellen i cant tell you what this has meant to me knowing his past ellen walked away from the relationship it could have saved me from more violence more pain more heartache it could have saved my life the domestic violence disclosure scheme was created after the murder of yearold clare wood killed by her exboyfriend george appleton in february like sarahs law which allows parents controlled access to the sex offenders register following the murder of eightyearold sarah payne in by a known paedophile clares law is the result of a campaign by the victims family in clares case michael brown who discovered that his daughter had been lied to by appleton about his past i never liked appleton brown tells me a wiry yearold scot he used to be a caterer at armley prison in leeds he had spent eight years in close contact with convicted criminals for no apparent reason the first time i met him i just said to myself i do not like this man and i told clare so he had told clare that he had been to prison but only for driving offences and she took his word she had no reason to be worried after all they were only driving offences clare had been off her fathers radar for several weeks at the start of the year but that wasnt unusual she had a habit of not topping up her mobile phone so i wasnt too worried says brown then as i was leaving the prison one night one of the officers said there was a call for me it was a detective from greater manchester police she told him they had found his daughters body i couldnt take it in at first i was numb clare who had an eight yearold daughter of her own had been strangled by appleton near her home in salford it turned out she had been subjected to months of harassment and assaults by appleton says brown but she hadnt said anything to me he shakes his head i was the same when i was young if i found myself in difficulties i didnt like to burden my parents either in the weeks that followed it emerged that appleton had an appalling record of violence against women including repeated instances of harassment threats stalking and aggravated burglary he had kidnapped one former girlfriend at knifepoint an independent police complaints commission investigation later found individual and systemic failures in greater manchester polices handling of the case on one occasion they had taken hours to respond to an emergency call for help when appleton was banging on clares door threatening to kill her six days after he carried out that threat he hanged himself when i heard about his history of violence i couldnt help think that if clare had known about it she could have made an informed decision not to spend her future with him says brown at the time i knew nothing about domestic violence i did some research and was shocked its rife the latest statistics indicate that one in four women and one in six men will suffer some kind of domestic abuse during their lifetime in domestic violence accounted for of all violent incidents in england and wales though only a fraction of cases are ever reported according to the crime survey of england and wales million women and men reported being victims of domestic abuse last year each time i met politicians or police officers i would ask them why women and men shouldnt have the right to know about their partners past if they had begun to experience violence from them says brown i got lots of apologies but no straight answers so i just kept on asking brown could not know but the association of chief police officers acpo had been asking similar questions during the inquest into clares death detective superintendent phil owen of greater manchester police who gave evidence on behalf of the force passed a briefing paper to the coroner jennifer leeming outlining acpo proposals for allowing greater disclosure in cases where victims could be said to be in imminent danger from a partner clares law was born its only a pilot scheme and its only halfway through but im hearing positive things about it says brown it has resulted in a huge change in attitudes among the police in the past they used to ignore domestics but now theyre taking them seriously i know that my daughters last moments were spent kicking and screaming i also know that she would have got out a lot sooner if she had known what a violent man appleton was if clares law allows even one woman to get out of such a relationship then her death wont have been in vain anyone can use clares law either someone who has become concerned about a partners abusive behaviour or a third party a mother father friend concerned for someone in a potentially dangerous relationship but the information isnt handed out lightly requests go before the police and agencies ranging from social services to the probation service and the nspcc and information is only disclosed if there is believed to be an imminent risk of harm the person receiving the information may not divulge it to anyone else if they do they can be prosecuted under the data protection act james baker made a request on behalf of his yearold daughter sandy last december after a new boyfriend had begun to frighten her she met him in a work situation and very quickly he let his intentions be known says baker an accountant who lives near his daughter in urmston manchester baker is typical of many parents concerned but not pushy he says he thought long and hard before making the request he knew that interfering could have been counterproductive at first sandy was flattered by all the attention but then it became obsessive he says there were constant phone calls and sometimes more than texts a day then when the boyfriend didnt get his own way his behaviour got worse he would try to stop her going out with her friends and when he failed he would damage things belonging to her it was a nightmare she broke it off several times but he would keep demanding that she take him back she was very frightened baker finally made a clares law request after being told by a friend that the boyfriend had allegedly attacked a former girlfriend the police made the disclosure to father and daughter together it turned out he had been convicted twice before for harassment says baker the police only gave us the information they said we needed and nothing going back more than three years but it was enough for my daughter to decide never to see him again the night sandy was given the disclosure some of her friends took her out when they returned to her home one went upstairs and found the boyfriend prowling in one of her rooms he escaped through a window but during a subsequent police search officers found evidence he had been hiding in her attic he has since been convicted of harassment and is awaiting sentence as a family weve been taking it in turns to stay with sandy she absolutely refuses to leave her home says baker at least clares law got sandy away from him before something terrible happened sandy is part of a closeknit family but often women can be at their most vulnerable when they leave a relationship with a known abuser the scheme offers police help from changing locks to installing panic alarms but there are concerns that clares law could fail if support services are not adequately funded karen ingala smith is chief executive of nia a london charity that has supported victims of domestic abuse for more than years she tells me she is generally supportive of clares law but theres no point informing someone theyre in a potentially abusive relationship without giving them the help they need to get out of it ingala smith points out that over the past few years budgets and grants for domestic violence services in local authorities and to independent agencies have been slashed what if a woman finds out that she is with a man with a history of violence but funding cuts mean she cant access help to leave him she then has to stay in the relationship knowing that she is with a person who has the capacity to harm her the home office boasts that it is providing m of funding for specialist domestic and sexual violence services over the next four years research conducted by lancaster university for the department of trade and industry in estimated that the cost to the nation of domestic violence in the previous year amounted to bn some womens groups oppose the scheme sandra horley chief executive of refuge the domestic abuse charity says clares law sounds good on paper but in reality it will do little to protect the majority of abused women simply knowing that your partner is violent isnt going to keep a woman safe what keeps women safe is strong protection from the police in general police practice around domestic violence is lamentable but there is evidence that attitudes to domestic violence are changing and few privacy groups have raised objections to the scheme soon the government will be considering whether clares law ought to be rolled out nationally i have no doubts about it at all says ellen lyndley i honestly believe this will protect people from violence

a swedish childcare expert who was called to brief mps last month on the dangers of subsidised daycare has been attacked as unscientific and unqualified by the author of the main study on which he drew jonas himmelstrand the keynote speaker at a house of commons event organised by the campaign group mothers at home matter linked nearuniversal preschool daycare in his country to an alarming decline in adolescents mental health and educational achievement as well as to rising youth suicides this is a dream which failed which any country attempting to emulate should be warned about he said after the talk david davis a former conservative party leadership candidate commended himmelstrand for his startling figures which he said demonstrated that separating children from their mothers at an early age and putting them into care while the mother returns to work can have damaging consequences however dr sven bremberg a researcher at swedens karolinska institute who led the inquiry into youth mental health cited by himmelstrand said his study had ruled out daycare as a cause there is no substance whatsoever behind himmelstrands statement that a decline of mental health in young people in sweden is related to daycare that was one of the points we specifically investigated he said bremberg said that himmelstrand should not be taken seriously by british mps himmelstrand does not have scientific qualifications as far as i know by misquoting he is handling arguments in a very unscientific way the mothers at home matter event was hosted in the commons by claire perry a conservative mp who is david camerons official adviser on parenting and childhood it was attended by iain duncan smith the work and pensions secretary the group formerly known as full time mothers gained prominence earlier this year after the government announced measures aimed at helping mothers return to work including shared parental leave and last month a new tax break on childcare worth up to per child per year the governments reforms reflect the influence of nordic family policy which combines generous shared parental leave with heavily subsidised daycare to keep mothers in the workforce in sweden of onetofiveyearolds spend time in daycare with the cost to parents capped in stockholm at around a month for the first child for the second and for a third himmelstrands talk received enthusiastic coverage in the daily mail and daily telegraph which referred to him respectively as a researcher and psychologist lynne burnham the secretary of mothers at home matter told the observer that himmelstrands research was all based on proper scientific figures she said he works quite closely with an american professor and sociologist i can certainly send you some of his research papers when contacted by the observer however himmelstrand said that he had been selftaught although his late father was an internationally known sociologist i cannot say i have an academic degree and i have never claimed to have one he said some british media have mistakenly written that i am a sociologist this is not correct in the introduction to his house of commons talk he said that he was the founder of the mireja institute and a faculty member of the neufeld institute founded by canadian psychologist dr gordon neufeld last week however he conceded that mireja was a oneman outfit the neufeld institute says on its website that it invites people to become faculty members if they complete an advanced course in homeschooling and a twoyear internship at its virtual campus at a cost of more than himmelstrand blamed brembergs criticisms on a misunderstanding saying he had only cited the study to support his claim of deteriorating youth mental health in sweden the link to daycare had come from other studies particularly a study by the national institute of child health and human development in the us i am convinced that i have a strong argument strong enough to question whether a system like that in sweden should be adopted without further study by other countries he said hehimmelstrand conceded that there had been no study since the s to investigate the links between high enrolment in daycare in sweden and mental health in later life the swedish government shows no signs of wanting to study the effects of daycare he said it is like a totalitarian system defending its ideology at any price a study showing that the swedish daycare system is not in all childrens best interest would shake the swedish political system he argued that this also meant that bremberg whom he described as on the extreme prodaycare side in sweden was overstating his case dr bremberg is making too strong a claim in saying there is no substance whatsoever that a decline of mental health in young people in sweden is related to daycare no one can claim this either way scientifically there are simply too many factors when challenged on himmelstrands qualifications to brief mps burnham noted that he had given speeches on daycare in other countries he travels the world speaking on these issues so i guess there must be some credibility to these figures she said its not just himmelstrand whos been saying this there are other people saying the same thing as well as brembergs study himmelstrands cited research by a swedish psychologist magnus kihlbom which he said demonstrated that a decline in the quality of swedish daycare meant that it was now actively harming many children when contacted kihlbom dismissed himmelstrand as probably a conservative i dont think its a question of eitheror he said even for very small children daycare of good quality with reliable relationships between the carer and the small child is good for most children a review of the evidence on daycare by the institute for public policy research to be published next month has concluded that the overall impact on child development is beneficial theres now a fairly strong body of evidence that highquality care has a positive effect on both cognitive development and also emotional social and behavioural development said imogen parker the author of the paper there are some studies that found that for the underthrees there might be a tradeoff between positive cognitive effects and negative behavioural effects but where that is the case these negative effects are shortlived and not particularly pronounced himmelstrand who is a fervent advocate of home schooling has moved his family to land a finnish island a threehour ferry ride from stockholm because he fears that the triggerhappy swedish social services might take his children into care he supports himself primarily through his work as a consultant promoting the mentoring ideas of mike pegg a british management writer and doing presentations on neufelds work he denies being a political conservative but is a regular speaker at the stockholm freedomfest a swedish offshoot of a gathering for radical libertarians set up by mark skousen a devout mormon freemarket economist perry and davis both declined to comment for this article,2013-04,swedish childcare expert wa called brief mp last month danger

i believe that by being at home full time to look after my children i am giving them the best possible start in life this is apparently a controversial statement the governments policies are designed to encourage women back into the workplace the policymakers must therefore believe that whether a mother works or not is irrelevant to the wellbeing and development of her child they must believe that a nanny childminder or childcare worker can provide as good if not better a start to life for a baby as the continuous unconditional loving care of their mother or father if not why are all their fiscal policies aimed at subsidising working mothers and penalising households where only one person works or is it that the governments only focus is the economy thatit isnt concerned about what might be the best start to life for future generations it believes that the tax contributions of working mothers are the priority has anyone worked out the return on investment of the governments expenditure on childcare it spends billions on subsidising the salaries of lowpaid childcare workers through tax credits and paying the childcare costs of working parents how many working mothers with small children are earning significantly more than the taxfree threshold most working mothers work flexible hours to allow them to be at home as much as possible i wonder how many contribute more to the treasury than they gain so why does the government persist in pouring money into enabling mothers to leave their babies and children in childcare settings rather than enabling them to stay at home why does the government not establish a level playing field why not allocate money per child and allow parents to decide how to spend it perhaps it could limit this childcentred funding to families on incomes below as per the latest childcare voucher system nick clegg loves the word choice many mothers would love to be able to choose to stay at home with their children unfortunately they are only allowed to choose to work other mothers may want to work part time but they cant find work that fits in with their childrens needs mothers at home matter of which i am a member recommends the introduction of a number of policies to enable families to have a genuine choice whether one parent stays at home full time or both work in addition to allocating funding per child we also support the introduction of the transferable tax allowance this would enable the spouse at home to transfer their allowance to their husband or wife this would have a disproportionately positive effect on those in the lower half of the income distribution the main beneficiaries would be oneearner families with children who are much more likely to be in the poorer half of the population than single people without dependents or two earner couples unlike the government mothers at home matter is not solely focused on the economics of childrearing we also recognise the importance of valuing the vital developmental role that mothers and fathers play when they are at home with their children nothing can substitute for the unconditional affirming love of a parent stayathome mothers havent traditionally had a voice we want to change this new members bring heartfelt stories of years spent caring for children yet being dismissed and undervalued because they are not working we also welcome working mothers who often see themselves primarily in their roles as mothers and secondarily as employees of organisations we recognise the efforts so many working mothers make to be there for their children as much as they can we call on the government to support them in their aspiration to be a mother at home as much as possible by ending the discrimination against oneearner

men putting women down in private and in public is a common event austin mitchell labour mp for great grimsby tweeted to louise mensch when she resigned as a conservative mp shut up menschkin a good wife doesnt disagree with her master in public and a good little girl doesnt lie about why she quit politics whether or not his remarks were meant to be ironic is beside the point when david cameron told angela eagle an openly lesbian labour mp to calm down dear in the commons it attracted widespread criticism not because women have no sense of humour rather because such remarks made by a powerful man within a system of institutionalised sexism causes harm and sets a bad example now bad boy john lydon formerly johnny rotten of sex pistol fame has joined the sexist hall of fame after ranting at a female presenter on australian tv when asked about thatchers death missus shut up shouted lydon followed by when a man is talking do not interrupt the presenters male colleague pulled no punches and accused lydon of being a sexist misogynist pig the thing is every feminist in my friendship circle has an exemplary sense of humour simply because they have to but dealing with idiots such as lydon always remains a surreal experience and being told constantly to give us a smile when we look disapproving of being called for example ugly old boots makes us appreciate the funny things in life below are my top five responses to misogynistic putdowns the bar i was in a bar with my female friend when a man asked what two lovely ladies were doing on their own and could he join us i told him we were not in fact on our own and to kindly leave us be ugly lezzers inevitably spat from his lips i told him that if he was a prime example of heterosexuality then every woman would choose lesbianism tic tac then there was the time i was told by a man who had just seen me on tv suggesting that it was wrong of men to sexually abuse women that i was too ugly to rape i told him that being hung like a tic tac should not make him bitter a male passerby obviously a far more chivalrous type heard the exchange and attempted to reassure me that i was indeed attractive enough to rape i was at that stage at a loss of what to say balls i recall a man on a radio debate telling me i was a stupid stupid girl to which i replied ill bet you couldnt count your balls and get the same answer twice the remote control a friend told me that once she bumped into her boyfriend when they were both on separate nights out he told her loudly and in front of a crowd that she was dressed like a slut and should go home and get changed her response if you want to control someone dickhead sleep with your remote control sperm ultimately if a man will not listen to reason when you explain how insulting it is for him to shout about the size of your tits in the street as happened to me the other day just tell him a little joke to diffuse the situation what do men and sperm have in common they both have a

children and young people in the uk are facing a bleaker future under the coalition government than they did under labour according to childrens charity unicef in what amounts to a direct challenge to the governments austerity agenda and widespread tightening of access to benefits unicef ranks the uk th out of developed countries for overall wellbeing and warns that teenagers prospects trail behind their counterparts in many european countries including slovenia the czech republic and portugal continuing high rates of teenage pregnancy relatively low levels of young people in education employment or training and problems of alcohol abuse in young teens push the uk down the international league table unicef said the situation facing young people in britain is expected to worsen as a result of government policies and it warns that since the downgrading of youth policy and cuts to local government services are having a profound negative effect on young people unicef says although the picture for british children may appear better than when the charity last compiled a league table which put it at the bottom of a country list in their prospects are worsening once more as the

parenting institute and institute for fiscal studies anita tiessen the deputy executive director of unicef uk said there is no doubt that the situation for children and young people has deteriorated in the last three years with the government making policy choices that risk setting back children in their most serious stages of development the government needs to acknowledge this and act now while children and young people will be the first to bear the brunt if we fail to safeguard their wellbeing over time society will pay the price the report draws on statistics from and shows a general improvement in childrens experiences over the first decade of this century compared with the previous scorecard from which looked at data from but unicef says further education participation rates in the uk are falling below compared with in other developed countries the country is in the bottom third of the table for infant mortality with a rate of per live births double the rate of sweden or finland and below estonia and slovenia furthermore the report says that about of yearolds in the uk report having been drunk at least twice and there is a teenage pregnancy rate of more than per the

to be a strong relationship with countries percapita gdp and there are signs that the countries of central and eastern europe are being to close the gap on more established industrial economies its report says as a moral imperative the need to promote the wellbeing of children is widely accepted as a pragmatic imperative it is equally deserving of priority failure to protect and promote the wellbeing of children is associated with increased risk across a wide range of laterlife outcomes the report says that these outcomes range from impaired cognitive development to lower levels of school achievement from reduced skills and expectations to lower productivity and earnings from higher rates of unemployment to increased dependence on welfare from the prevalence of antisocial behaviour to involvement in crime from the greater likelihood of drug and alcohol abuse to higher levels of teenage births and from increased health care costs to a higher incidence of mental

i dont think there will be a woman prime minister in my lifetime as education secretary in people from my sort of background needed grammar schools to compete with children from privileged homes like

where there is despair may we bring hope on her election as prime minister in we are not asking for a penny piece of community money for britain what we are asking is for a very large amount of our

as society there are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people must look after themselves first it is our duty to look after ourselves and then also to look after our neighbours in an interview in womens own in it is ironic that just when those countries such as the soviet union which have tried to run everything from the

there is a special place in hell for women who dont help other women the original quote came from madeleine albright in at a wnba luncheon called celebrating inspiration since then it has taken on a life of its own misquoted and misattributed but never delivered with less than full feeling it is the goto putdown for any woman publically besieged by another woman particularly it seems women vaguely on the conservative side who get extra mileage perhaps from knowing how much albright will be vexed by their use of it theres a place in hell said sarah palin on the stump in and with characteristic ballpark accuracy reserved for women who dont support other women albrights point was a valid one female solidarity is not a question of blindly promoting other women of making nice no matter what but it is does entail putting oneself out for those one judges deserving it also requires a measure of flexibility it is odd and regrettable that the most vehement feminists are never moved to greater anger than when faced with another womens definition of the cause going back to steinem v friedan the miami title match its her baby damn it wrote nora ephron from the national womens political caucus convention that year after witnessing friedans fury at steinem for hogging the publicity her movement is she supposed to sit still and let a beautiful thin lady run off with it forty years on and a lot of feminists recoiled from sheryl sandberg on what one suspects were similar grounds stylistic as much as political buffed and besuited and not looking the part here sandberg swanned in a latecomer to feminism and stole all the oxygen my god had she even heard of the feminine mystique why was she advertising starbucks in all her publicity gigs you cant be a real feminist and have hair that fanatically blow dried and isnt anyone that successful in the corporate arena a surrogate guy anyway she makes naomi wolf practically look like andrea dworkin etc a lot of noses were put out of joint with lean in and the beneficiary of the derision as always is those who deride the whole feminist enterprise so it will go until there are enough women at the top to lessen the

we asked for your thoughts on the relationship between workingclass issues and feminism your replies show a great diversity of experiences and opinions from ardent feminist supporters to workers who feel deeply let down by the movement isabel glasgow as a single working mother with a yearold daughter i couldnt really not be a feminist seeing the pressures my daughter will face as she progresses into adulthood makes me realise we all have a way to go but its not feminism that runs the world its money the media guardian included tend to fixate on the number of women in boardrooms or whether some neoliberal rightwing politician is a feminist rather than looking at the reality of working life ive also been quite shocked at the hostility shown to parents mothers especially some of the comments found on this very website have a real venom to them there is at times a sense that if you are a mother and especially a workingclass mother then by default you should not have embarked on parenthood at all i dont think the issue is about how feminism represents workingclass women at all its how the media and politicians choose to portray them its not feminism that has the power to control what advertisers the music industry and the media tell us if anything feminists tend to be the ones pointing out how damaging it can be martin portsmouth the pay gap maternity leave opportunities for promotion prison conditions all have been addressed by feminism but what irks me is when feminists talk about seeking equality when i see women queueing up for jobs down coalmines i will believe they are serious about it some of the social and political issues brought to prominence by the suffragette movement were not necessarily about voting per se but about the disparity between the way different classes were treated about the disproportionate sense of entitlement the wealthy elite garnered for themselves we were making good progress in some of these areas but we seem to have slipped back since the more radical feminism of the s became less fashionable as for me feminism cant help my situation im poor unemployed and struggling on a week never mind the glass ceiling its whether or not i can afford to get the water heater fixed that worries me the most lauren paisley i am proud to call myself a feminist however i believe in equality not just for women but for everyone and that is where i think feminism goes wrong at times a workingclass man from scotland working in a minimumwage job is going to be far worse off than a middleclass woman in the south of england feminism does not address that the movement today seems to focus on issues that white middleclass women face exclusively such as increasing political and workplace representation or getting more women into top jobs but it doesnt address the fact that many women feel put off from going for promotions because of commitments at home such as childcare and care of elderly relatives middleclass women find themselves in top jobs because they can afford the time to focus on their career workingclass women do not have the same luxury seb london i come from a white workingclass singleparent family i was a soldier and a teacher and i worked with workingclass white boys in the penal system i would see myself in the third wave of feminism i am sick of the secondwave dinosaurs who are currently in power lecturing me on my undeserved privilege berating me as an oppressor excluding me for being male when by and large i am sympathetic with the majority of their goals i just dont like the way they have turned what should be the greatest civil rights movement in history into a single issue lobbying movement which furthers their unearned privilege as wealthy white western women ignoring everyone else who has suffered from patriarchy including workingclass men with my work i saw workingclass boys being treated as disposable war assets by the government or as disposable criminal problems by the penal system if eight times more women than men were in prison it would be a feminist issue if three times more women killed themselves every year it would be a feminist issue the lack of support in mens mental health is terrible my male doctor does not even know who to refer a male patient to for support this impacts me personally but these issues impact all female family members too there is so much more we can achieve as a team ciara dublin ireland i am passionately involved in feminist student and prochoice activism in ireland which recognises that it is workingclass women who cannot afford to travel to the uk to access abortion services feminism helps address the following concerns in my life sexism class inequality harassment on public transport representation of women in the media lack of reproductive rights and adequate healthcare and casual sexism encountered on a regular basis feminism has helped women including workingclass women like myself to have a voice to be able to speak for ourselves rather than have others speak on our behalf i also believe there are good reasons for feminism to have focused on womens careers at a professional level this means more women legislating in government as board members as managers through my experience of my involvement with feminism i feel in no way left out excluded or let down i feel left out let down and excluded by the irish government the catholic church and other patriarchal models but how could i possibly feel let down by feminism of all things lynne sheffield yes im a feminist but when did you last read a feminist article about how a hospital cleaner struggles with childcare provision that doesnt fit her working hours and which is beyond the means of her meagre pay packet i think women are getting a raw deal from current government policies all round changes to the statutory pensionable age couldnt have been anticipated and will hit older workingclass women who havent had the luxury of a professional career path very hard im deeply concerned that cuts to social care will increase womens burden of care yes a burden even when done out of love and that cuts to both the voluntary and public sector will see more women and children living with domestic abuse unable to access the support services they need its time for women to say enough is enough and feminism can help us mobilise to do just that,2013-04,asked thought relationship workingclass issue feminism reply show great diversity experience opinion ardent feminist supporter worker feel deeply let

ms magazine but her personal account of going undercover to work as a bunny at the playboy club riveted readers giving them insight into a male bastion that few knew firsthand a bunnys tale appeared in the may and june issues of show magazine in the same year that betty friedans the feminine mystique and sylvia plaths the bell jar were published thats tough competition but in hindsight it is clear that a bunnys tale complements friedan and plath and deserves to be honored rather than forgotten as it has been for the serious muckraking journalism it is at the core of a bunnys tale is steinems belief that the sexual revolution will fail if men are the only ones allowed to define it in taking on playboy magazine founder hugh hefner and his playboy clubs steinem showed she could more than hold her own against an opponent with his own media empire by playboy was reaching a million readers a month and in when a bunnys tale was published the playboy clubs were flourishing hefner who had started playboy in was at the height of his influence and not content with making himself rich he had in begun penning monthly essays that he insisted would be the emancipation proclamation of the sexual revolution steinem was unimpressed she did not hesitate to treat hefners emancipation claims as bunk she went after him where he was most vulnerable showing readers what it actually meant to work at a playboy club a bunnys tale takes the form of a diary and moves from steinems initial decision to adopt the alias of marie catherine ochs to her last day on the job when she overhears another bunny say of a customer hes a real gentleman he treats you just the same whether youve slept with him or not in between steinem learns the requirements of being a bunny on the clubs orders she is tested for venereal disease and after being hired she is told which club members she can date number one keyholders and which she cannot all the rest her new status leaves no room for doubting how she is viewed a guard greets her by calling out here bunny bunny bunny the club wardrobe mistress stuffs a plastic dry cleaning bag down the front of her bunny costume to increase her cleavage finally the job doesnt come close to paying the to weekly salary the playboy club advertizes that bunnies earn at every turn steinem and the other bunnies are nickeled and dimed they must she notes pay for the

trap for the bunnies whose vulnerability steinem captured by sharing their ordeal in taking this approach to her article steinem was doing what many new journalists did in the s when they made their personal experiences central to the events they reported on tom wolfe took this path in the electric koolaid acid test norman mailer in the armies of the night and hunter thompson in hells angels in steinems case the great challenge was resisting the temptation to lash out against those who were alternately patronizing and exploiting her she had to know that when a bunnys tale appeared in print she was going to be accused of exploiting her good looks a homely woman as the playboy club made clear in its ads could not be a playboy bunny since a bunnys tale first appeared it has taken on a life of its own in a bunnys tale was made into an abc television movie starring kirstie alley and today steinems story which she retitled i was a playboy bunny when she included it in a collection of her own writing retains its freshness in the college writing class i teach i often assign a bunnys tale to students who want to do firstperson reporting the majority of them begin by not knowing who

the cost of childcare could be cut by as much as if the government was to go ahead with stalled plans to raise ratios of children to staff in nurseries government plans are currently stalled due to a disagreement within the coalition between the liberal democrats and the conservatives the new calculations released by the department for education under a freedom of information request said parent costs could be cut from an hour to an hour a cut while teacher salaries could go up alternatively if the extra revenue was used solely to reduce costs for parents this could yield costs savings for parents of up to conservative ministers had been hoping to relax staffchild ratios by september but nick clegg the deputy prime minister vetoed the plans saying he thought the proposed ratio changes would lower the quality of childcare conservatives are likely to use the figures to show they have been on the side of parents and choice but are being blocked by the liberal democrats department estimates suggest that if legal ratios for underthrees rose from four children for each member of staff to six and increased from a ratio of one to eight to one to for staff looking after overthrees the number of fulltime places could be expanded by to this increase in places creates a gross additional revenue of around based on the nursery charging an hour even assuming the setting required the employment of a graduate revenue would rise by distributing this over childcare places for weeks a year and hours a week the nursery could maintain its revenues and reduce its fees from an hour to an hour a reduction of the figures are bound to be raised by allies of the education secretary michael gove and the childrens minister liz truss to show that parents are being denied a largescale cut in their childcare costs by liberal democrat objections it is not yet clear if the plans can be revived but gove has acknowledged that his plan to introduce the changes by september are looking hard to implement he claimed that clegg had vetoed the plans because he was worried he was about to be challenged for his party leadership by the business secretary vince cable the daycare trust earlier this

on monday the times reported that parents are being asked by schools to subsidise work experience placements by paying around or more for the opportunity with an additional fee for placements in london following the governments decision to drop compulsory work experience for to yearolds last year parents are now picking up the bill for risk assessments and admin associated with placements placing a financial burden on parents seems not only unfair but also likely to enforce social imbalances in the classroom and the workplace asking parents to pay a higher fee for placements that are further afield imposes a barrier that many young people and their parents will not be able to overcome while students from wealthy families might score their dream placement in a big company in london others will get left behind stuck with a limited choice of local businesses in which to work if organised properly work placements can be great experiences for young people when i was i did work experience at a local jewellery shop as part of a school requirement it was my first experience in a working environment and i loved it i came back to school with a newfound confidence and love of jewellerymaking after the placement i went on to get a saturday job there which i kept for three years many of my peers had similar experiences in which work placements became a first job and it was in this job that i learnt the meaning of work and earning my own money although i did not expect to be paid on the actual placement where i was just observing what went on it gave me the important experience that then led me into employment that first job taught me that i have a value i still have a photocopy of my first pay cheque by telling young people and their parents to pay for these experiences we are setting them up to undervalue what they have to offer work experience placements can be incredibly beneficial and doing them while at school and still living with parents is perhaps the perfect time to get a glimpse of the working world without the worry of how to pay your rent but making them the financial responsibility of parents sends out the wrong messages messages that are hard to undo later in life it makes young people believe from an early age that they should be willing to pay for these kinds of experiences and it tells parents that it is their duty to support their children while they do so for struggling families these additional costs could come as a real burden a burden that risks splitting a class into those who can and those who cant perhaps change is on its way labour is reportedly working on a proposal to reinstate compulsory work experience in schools in a bid to better equip young people with the professional skills to get them into the workplace i believe that quality work experience placements are a great thing and that they should be part of our curriculum when done fairly they give school pupils invaluable professional experience confidence and can lead them into employment but just dont make the parents catch the costs because in the end it is the children who pay,2013-05,monday time reported parent asked school subsidise

the past week has again highlighted the inexplicable absence of an intelligent discussion conducted by men about ourselves its followed a familiar pattern a leading female commentator diane abbott on this occasion diagnoses male ailments and prescribes her cures what comes back from the patient silence can there be any group that is subject to so much debate and accusation and is so apparently powerful yet remains so utterly speechless it reminds me of a stereotypical scene a woman challenging a man on some personal or domestic issue him sitting before her silently absorbing stonewalling and eventually walking away its a dissatisfying experience for both she complains to her friends he has no one to talk to somewhere here are clues to this bewildering male silence on the public stage about our own condition mens absence from the debate has dramatic consequences making it overwhelmingly negative in recent weeks the focus has been on abuse of teenage girls porn male unemployment and misogyny but next month it could be deadbeat dads domestic violence and harassment in the workplace a debate about men defined by women inevitably dwells on whats wrong with men on a continuing crisis thats understandable there are many worrying issues that a male discussion of masculinity would and should confront we are after all fathers husbands brothers sons lovers colleagues and friends of women but which man wants to join a debate loaded with negativity littered with slogans like all men are rapists a debate with genuine male participation and leadership would include the above issues but within a broader aspirational and authentically male agenda the centrepiece would be todays extraordinary transformation of masculinity a huge transition is taking place in all our lives as we redefine our relationships with women with our children with work with our sexuality history may judge it to be a faster and more profound change even than the developments in womens lives men like women are belatedly escaping what we now recognise to be the confines of our gender many of us are enjoying a massively increased engagement with children there is a stunning growth in male capacity to hold down successful jobs and play an integral role in our homes and personal lives we are changing our relationships with women and with each other male homosexuality is widely expressed and affirmed and men play a vital role in supporting personally and politically the advancement of womens rights but all this fails to generate male leadership or collective discussion each of us is operating in our personal world of change with little sense of what its like for the other guys the womens movement produced articulate women to narrate their agenda where are the men an important factor is that otherwise powerful educated men the ones you might expect to speak up tend to have been raised in and live in households where they defer to female decisionmaking and narrative the reasons are complicated womens centrality in the private arena is a complex expression of both male power and male impotence of patriarchy and infantilisation but a consequence of boys and men living in private matriarchies is that even the most senior male chief executive often lacks confidence in areas that might be defined as personal private or family this may always have been the case but feminism has reinforced rather than challenged or even acknowledged matriarchy it is an environment in which male spokesmen for change are unlikely to be nurtured when they do articulate their views or concerns they are often ridiculed or ignored by women misandry can be as nasty as misogyny and is as widespread just check the internet smart men play safe and stay out of it were so conditioned we dont even talk to each other however as long as these men who typically support the womens movement remain passive the only male voices we hear are those of reactionary patriarchs who reinforce the idea that men are dinosaurs why are we ridiculed when we talk about ourselves perhaps because men are assumed to be inherently powerful with nothing to complain about its a mistake we urgently require an updated theory of gender that acknowledges there are and always have been discrete areas of female power and male powerlessness not simply female powerlessness patriarchy did not rule alone there was also matriarchy and there still is a revolution is taking place in masculinity but much of it is below the radar and denied even when welldocumented this transformation is about much more than helping women and addressing their complaints if we want to hear about it then we need democratic personal private and domestic spaces where men feel comfortable to speak that might generate a more open less condemning public space until then women will continue to find themselves shouting into the silence about issues that we need to confront together,2013-05,past week ha highlighted

maria stubbings called for help many times long before she was strangled with a dog lead by her exboyfriend and left under a pile of coats in the downstairs toilet her killer marc chivers had already been arrested for assaulting her and breaking into her home when he opened the door to the police and told them all was well they believed him and left a card for the motheroftwo asking her to give them a call there were many errors of judgment leading up to this murder but the failure to recognise the dangers inherent in a man with a known history of violence against women chivers had already served a year sentence for murder is pretty breathtaking as is the fact that this vicious murder is not even an isolated case two women are killed as a result of domestic violence every week in the uk on average a figure that has not changed for years in some areas one in five calls to the police each week are for domestic violence while up to a third of domestic incidents recorded are repeat incidents that is the same victims calling again and again for help after each horrific murder the local police force typically says that lessons have been learnt and changes have been made and then more women and children are killed in essex women and children including christine chambers and her daughter and jeanette goodwin died after maria stubbings despite repeated calls for help is this a result of human error in a complex private environment or is something more insidious at stake that leaves these women ignored and powerless womens campaigners including sandra horley chief executive of refuge which supports victims of domestic violence believe that only a full public inquiry will tell observers may scoff and suggest that public inquiries are all too frequent but how else to address the consistent failure to help such women and the vast majority of victims of domestic violence are women although of course men and boy suffer too there may be problems at an individual level in the police force but its procedures and practices are a microcosm of society and it is the worrying tendencies of society to blame the victim she was asking for it or to regard such matters as best left behind closed doors its just a domestic that need to be examined here there are signs of change of course heads of domestic violence units in london who suggest a real attempt to change behaviour with junior officers given training and told of the possible consequences of ignoring a call they are warned they could lose their jobs if the worst happens yet such attitudes are patchy to say the least and seem to have had no effect on the crime the macpherson inquiry found that the police had failed to provide an appropriate and professional service with processes attitudes and behaviour harmful to the minority ethnic community when it finally reported on the appalling death of stephen lawrence it took more than years for this country to realise that jimmy savile was not one isolated pervert but the symptom of a culture that allowed such abuse and ignored the pleas for help lets not wait another years to examine in what ways we are allowing the perpetrators of domestic violence to

according to diane abbott britain is facing a crisis of masculinity in a speech made on thursday under the auspices of the thinktank demos the shadow health minister warned of a generation of angry inarticulate young men who had no idea of their role in society raised on a diet of pornography and consumerism they were caught between the stiffupperlip approach of previous generations and the pornified ideals of a youth culture that featured viagra as a party drug and promoted sexism and homophobiamore prone to depression and less well educated than young women and perhaps jobless despite a degree they often found themselves trapped in the parental home as longterm adolescents who increasingly resented family life in abbotts phrase they were hypermasculine that is aggressive and misogynistic without any understanding of the manysided nature of a mans life and no talent for selfexpression the speech was contested even before it was delivered the columnist and novelist tony parsons wrote that men have never been better never as articulate about their emotions or more involved with their children and partners to remedy any remaining flaws he wanted boxing lessons in every school and a return to the manly virtues that would oblige good men to protect women and children by punching bullies in the cakehole here was a man joining in the debate as so many women writers have recently invited us to and finding part of the solution in how men behaved in the east end c or at least as how ealing studios imagined they did a world in which a man lands a blow on an adulterer and says thatll larn ya a world without nonces or killers photographing their dead yearold victims a world where grooming still means dont overdo the brylcreem sonny and straighten that tie could such a place ever have existed it may be worth remembering if we are charting the fall of man that jack the ripper walked the same streets years before writing as a man but a sentence that begins that way is too ridiculous to finish lets try instead writing as a boy as a boy growing up in the s what did i see and hear that might confirm abbotts implication that men were somehow better then i see more of my mother than my father who goes off to work on his bike every morning before i get up while my mother makes the fire and shops and cooks and cleans until he returns after five from our street of families only two of the married women have jobs outside the home and only a few of the men are pubgoers i have hobbies a bike comics a stamp album model trains that now seem almost risibly characteristic of their period i have no idea of pornography and have never heard the word though at the bottom of a cupboard my father has secreted his prewar copies of health and efficiency magazine which i sometimes excavate from their protective covering of gardening manuals blackandwhite photographs show naked women smiling innocently up at the sun they all look rather wholesome and elevated like margaret dumont in duck soup the only eroticism lies in their nudity as my father once had a brief flirtation with naturism a sun lamp is other evidence i have never known whether the magazines were proof of personal philosophy or secret desire perhaps both at any rate they constituted my idea of dirty magazines and were therefore of little help in understanding the details of the profumo affair and the duchess of argylls divorce case when they became the twin sensations of for the wider public the gripping mystery of the latter was the identity of the headless man in the polaroid pictures shown to the court but never published for me it was the puzzle of what was allegedly being done to him by the duchess in i wouldnt have known what fellatio was couldnt have guessed what the judge meant when he mentioned depravity and in that year i turned i had already started work how typical was i i suspect that at least i wasnt untypical arriving just too late for national service my generation of young british males may have been the most sexually underinformed yearolds since but it may be wrong to construe from our ignorance the notion that women and children were then less endangered by the malevolent behaviour and fantasies of men lewd and libidinous behaviour was an intriguing phrase that cropped up in the local papers court reports across our street a husband sometimes gave his wife a black eye and presumably other less visible bruises too while in the next street a man went to prison for sexually abusing his daughter the incest of uncles with nieces also produced one or two children i knew most of these facts were related to me only many years later no matter that we read the eagle comic and won our badges in the cubs promising to do our best for god and the queen our village had not been brigadoon still i think that taken as whole the men of our fathers generation by which i mean men born in the first quarter of the last century were better people than we have been or perhaps have needed to be the american tv journalist tom brokaw coined the phrase the greatest generation to describe the men and women who had grown up in the s depression fought in the second world war or served the military effort at home and in the years after victory turned the us into a superpower of course the phrase is absurd even when confined to the prism that is americas view of itself whos to be the judge but its appeal becomes difficult to resist even in a british context whenever an old pilot soldier or seaman appears on television most recently the survivors of arctic and atlantic convoys their matteroffact stoicism seems incredible as geoffrey wheatcroft wrote recently in a review of a memoir by churchills daughter lady soames in which she recounts her days with the womens army corps sentimentality about the greatest generation is a besetting temptation but damn it all they were wonderful and we who came after have not lived up to them but this isnt just about the war those of us born into the old working class also tend to venerate our parents for their selfdenial and decency and also because that way of life being dead is more easily simplified and honoured sir alex ferguson is perhaps the most extreme example of what might be called workingclass ancestor worship few of us would name our houses after our fathers workplace or a racehorse supposing we owned one after an artefact that our fathers workplace had built but the ferguson mansion in cheshire is called fairfields after the glasgow shipyard and his horse queensland star after a cargo liner that fairfields launched for the australia trade in this is a reciprocal act of love a small repayment for the love that ferguson never forgets to stress he enjoyed as a boy of all the factors that may contribute to abbotts condition of hypermasculinity idleness drugs industrial quantities of pornography the absence of love is surely the most crucial though

david cameron has indicated that a compromise will be found in the coalition over childcare after saying it would be wrong to become frustrated over differences with the liberal democrats speaking in new york before returning home after a three day visit to the us the prime minister said he was confident of finding a way forward over plans to relax childtostaff ratios in england cameron also denied that he was biased against stayathome mothers after the government unveiled childcare tax breaks for working parents he said the government was not seeking to dictate to mothers over the choices they make a coalition row broke out last week over childcare when nick clegg confirmed he had raised objections to plans by liz truss the childrens minister to allow child minders to increase the number of underones they can look after from three to four this would increase from four to six for children over the age of two the rules for threeyearolds would remain the same eight or children per adult depending on whether a graduate was present clegg said he feared that the changes would not improve childcare and may not even reduce costs his remarks which came after studying responses to a government consultation prompted a furious reaction from the tories the prime minister said he supported the truss proposals but added that he was open to negotiating a compromise with the lib dems he said on the ratios i think trying to get quality affordable childcare is a very important priority for the government i think the proposals that we put forward about both qualifications and ratios had a lot of merit clearly there now needs to be a discussion in the coalition about how best to go forward and respond to the consultation but im confident as with all these things we will find a way forward theres no point getting too frustrated about these things well find a way forward that i hope will be good for people who want affordable childcare which is a very very major priority for people the prime minister who has faced criticism from the right wing newspapers for discriminating against stayathome mothers after the government unveiled childcare tax breaks for working parents said he supported mothers whatever choices they make he said i support the choices that mums make and if they want to work we should support that and if they want to stay at home we should support that the idea is not to dictate to people what they should do but to support the choices they make there are lots of things we do do that help stayathome mums the support were giving for nursery education for instance is a good example of that,2013-05,david cameron ha indicated compromise found coalition childcare saying would wrong become frustrated difference liberal democrat speaking new

nearly children aged five to seven are acting as unpaid carers for family members or guardians according to figures that have been published which were described by one childrens charity as the tip of the iceberg the data compiled from the census shows nearly a quarter of a million people under in england and wales were caring for parents siblings and others coping with pressures which charities say cause many to fall behind in school and miss out on their own childhoods an increase in the number of five to sevenyearold carers in england over the last decade was one of the starker trends to emerge although observers suggest this may be because the size of this group was underreported in the past girls are slightly more likely to be carers than boys while youngsters from black asian or other minority ethnic communities were twice as likely to be carers the childrens society said that the figures were unlikely to represent the true picture as many child carers remain hidden from the view of authorities the charity called for greater state support for young carers who it said were one and a half times more likely to have a longstanding illness or disability or special educational need than their peers they also have significantly lower educational attainment at gcse level the equivalent of nine grades lower overall than their peers many young carers remain hidden from official sight for a host of reasons including family loyalty stigma bullying not knowing where to go for support the charity said in a report hidden from view which pointed out that the number of young carers in england had risen by a fifth since the last census in the latest census figures reveal that a total of minors are carers for their loved ones with providing more than hours of care a week and between and hours children aged made up the largest group of young care providers with providing unpaid care of the five to sevenyearolds providing care are doing so for more than hours a week and for between and hours in the eight to nineyearold age bracket children are giving care for more than hours a week and for between and hours statistics on the levels of health among child carers revealed that more than had bad or very bad health while more than said it was fair matthew reed chief executive of the childrens society said this new figure is shocking enough but we know from years of working with young carers that it is likely to be just the tip of the iceberg many often incredibly vulnerable young carers are slipping through the net undetected by the support services they so desperately need david holmes chief executive of family action which supports disadvantaged and socially isolated families said it wanted the government to address the needs of young carers through the children and families bill currently before parliament we would like to see a duty on schools to identify young carers in the school population and the development of improved support said holmes who added that many young carers felt unable to disclose their caring responsibilities because of a lack of trust in teachers or a fear of agencies intervening at home or worries about being bullied a department for education spokeswoman said we know young carers need more help and we are supporting local authorities to do much more for these dedicated young people we recently announced that young carers will be involved in the training of school nurses so they know exactly what support they should offer and can champion their needs we have also created a specific training guide for teachers to help them to better identify and support young carers and funded the childrens society and carers trust to support social services to adopt whole family approaches to support young carers case study i had to grow up for jack garrigan the moment he had to very quickly start taking on adult responsibilities came last year when his mother louise lost her sight after the sudden onset of a rare virus mum was in hospital for a month and it was over four weeks that i had to grow up really says the yearold who along with his sister laura is among nearly a quarter of a million children in england and wales caring for a relative in the case of the garrigan family from the blackley district of manchester it involves jack stepping in to cook shop and in his mothers words ensure the household keeps running the three of us work as a team so we all do our bit he says on a typical morning for example my sister would help my mum get dressed and i would prepare the breakfast and make sure that laura is looking nice for school too the routine takes its toll sometimes you can get tired especially when there are school exams going on as well and the he admits to missing some things that other yearolds enjoy i used to go to a drama club workshop but i cant do it any longer because there is no way of getting there and i have too much to do he says but he adds matteroffactly at the end of the day she is my mum and whatever i do i do it because i have to and because i want to concerned that her son is playing down his role in the family mrs garrigan adds i dont think he really knows how much he does because its so constant and we are in a routine now he does my tablets and prescriptions he basically keeps the house going this article was amended on may to correct the spelling of

we need to talk about masculinity across a country torn by recession and struggling to adapt to social change men and boys are feeling lost and powerless unsure what the future holds and what role they might play in it most feel as if theyre not allowed to question what it means to be a man today or discuss what it might mean tomorrow the labour mp diane abbott launching a new campaign this week is not the first person to kick up a fuss about this crisis of masculinity in a speech to the thinktank demos on thursday she said that millions of young men are in distress acting out violently or sinking into depression unfortunately the only solution many in the audience could offer is not giving men and boys more power over their own lives but restoring their traditional power over women as breadwinners and male providers nobody seems to have bothered to ask men and boys whether they actually want to be breadwinners or whether female independence is really their biggest worry at a time when youth unemployment is more than sadly the debate is still focused on the evils of feminism and on convincing men their real problem is that women are no longer forced to trade a lifetime of resentful sex for financial security the chosen scapegoats inevitably are single mothers there is no creature more loathed and misunderstood in modern britain than the single mother on benefits she is blamed both for the financial crisis and for the attendant collapse in mens selfesteem the academic geoff dench was among those who attacked her complaining that the taxes of working men pay for single mothers benefits the taxes of working women presumably are spent on shoes and lipstick call me an ironknickered feminist lingeriearsonist if you must but i thought we had agreed that forcing women and their children to choose between a husband and punishing poverty was a policy best left back in the dark ages where it came from along with smallpox and witchburning as abbott noted domestic and gendered violence always increases during times of high unemployment and social breakdown because men often find it easier to take their feelings of frustration and powerlessness out on women governments are only too happy for them to do so the conservative party has long relied on a mythical golden age of marriage and family values as the solution to civil unrest in the real world not all men want to be breadwinners just like not all men want to be violent or to have power over women what men do want however is to feel needed and wanted and useful and loved they arent alone in this its one of the most basic human instincts and for too long we have been telling men and boys that the only way they can be useful is by bringing home money to a doting wife and kids or possibly by dying in a war it was an oppressive constricting message years ago and its doubly oppressive now that society has moved on and even wars are being fought by robots who leave no widows behind the big secret about the golden age of male providers is that it never existed first women have always worked second and just as importantly there have always been men who were too poor too queer too sensitive too disabled too compassionate or simply too clever to submit to whatever model of masculinity society relied upon to keep its wars fought and its factories staffed traditional masculinity like traditional femininity is a form of social control and seeking to reassert that control is no answer to a generation of young men who are quietly drowning in a world that doesnt seem to want them there can be no doubt that men are in distress societys unwillingness to let go of the tired old breadwinner model of masculinity contributes to that distress instead of talking about what men and boys can be instead of starting an honest conversation about what masculinity means there is a conspiracy of silence around these issues that is only ever broken by conservative rhetoric and lazy stereotypes we still dont have any positive models for postpatriarchal masculinity and in this age of desperation and uncertainty we need them more than ever,2013-05,need talk masculinity across

a series of coalition policies threaten to have profoundly deleterious effects on childrens lives driving widening inequalities and sending more families into poverty according to a scathing report by the british medical association in the page analysis entitled growing up in the uk the bmas board of science delivers a sustained assault on government flagship policies covering welfare and health warning that they are likely to hit the most vulnerable patients in the nhs the doctors union says that contrary to a pledge by david cameron the administrations policies are unlikely to be described by health policy analysts as familyfriendly the report says that cuts to child benefit sure start centre closures and regressive tax policies have already affected women and children this has occurred it adds at a time when there appear alarming trends for young people in society driven by poverty and inequality extreme disparities include children a year failing to meet a basic standard of good development such as the ability to speak recognise words and dress themselves the bma reports it says it is not acceptable to fail children on such a grand scale even when the government has made the right noises on alcohol and cigarettes it has drawn back from legislating for minimum pricing or plain wrapping for tobacco the bma notes and where ministers have acted on healthy eating they have done so by coopting the fastfood industry to tackle the rise in obesity overconsumption of snacks fizzy drinks and fast food has caused children now starting school to be obese at the age of four the bma maintains that the governments responsibility deal on food has at its heart a fundamental conflict of interest it calls for the government to pull out of deals with big business over fast food while the food industry has a role to play this should be when a strategy is in place and regulations are being implemented it is essential that government moves away from partnership with industry and looks at effective alternatives to selfregulation to ensure that there is a transparent and effective policy sir albert aynsleygreen the first childrens commissioner and an adviser to the bma said that more worrying still was the way the government turned a deaf ear to global evidence on health policy he pointed out that canada had recently begun public information campaigns warning that drinking while pregnant increased the risk of brain damage and the link to criminality in the unborn child he said i wrote to the chief medical officer about this issue which is a live one internationally she gave me the brushoff saying ministers were awaiting who guidelines they are not taking it seriously the bma says rising levels of poverty and inequality will place enormous pressure on the nhs where there are still significant numbers of children whose deaths are avoidable death rates from pneumonia asthma and meningococcal disease are higher in the uk than in comparable european countries if the uk had the same allcause death rate as sweden around childrens lives could be saved each year the report states the report arrives at a time when there are fears over the gap between the number of paediatricians employed by hospitals and the number required to staff existing acute services doctors say that the coalition will have to take responsibility for the fallout of its policies the bma warns that the most recent international studies place the uk th out of nations in terms of child wellbeing and that this may not reflect the current situation and does not reflect the impact of policies implemented post the election although britain has improved from its position at the bottom of the global rankings in the report says this advance could be reversed hitting the most vulnerable hardest which would exacerbate child poverty and widen social inequalities the authors say they found shocking details for a society that considers itself to be childfriendly they point out that the department of healths own work in concluded that more children and young people are dying in the uk than in other countries in northern and western europe it also highlights data published last month showing that the highest number of children ever recorded in the uk were referred to local authority care mainlyover abuse and neglect issues the report calls for several measures including parenting classes improving improvements to maternal nutrition and policies aimed at children in need it also argues that measures are needed to create a more equal society as current government austerity policies are predicted to cause child poverty to rise substantially a government spokesperson said theres a lot of misleading stories about the effects of our tax and benefit changes the truth is our welfare reforms will improve the lives of some of the poorest families in our communities with universal credit making three million households better off and lifting hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty and by next year we will have taken two million of the lowest earners out of paying tax altogether every child should have the same opportunity to lead

the governments austerity policy of pruning back welfare benefits and social care could set the country back even further in terms of child poverty and child wellbeing with the very poorest in society hit hardest a landmark report from the british medical association says in the page report growing up in the uk the bma says that the most recent international work places the country th out of nations in terms of child wellbeing but the doctors say this may not reflect the current situation and does not reflect the impact of policies implemented post the election although britain has improved from its position at the bottom of the global rankings in the report says this advance could be reversed hitting the most vulnerable hardest which would exacerbate child poverty and widen social inequalities in updating the research the authors say they found shocking details for a society that considers itself to be childfriendly the report points out that the department of healths own work in concluded that more children and young people are dying in the uk than in other countries in northern and western europe it also highlights data published last month showing that the highest number of children ever recorded in the uk were referred to local authority care mainly for abuse and neglect the report calls for a cocktail of measures including parenting classes improving maternal nutrition and targeting children in need the bma says it was shortsighted of ministers to slash funding from many health intervention projects that were addressing the causes of social breakdown rather than paying for the consequences it points out that spent in prevention programmes aimed at children results in a tenfold saving to the taxpayer professor averil mansfield chair of the bmas board of science said the bma is particularly concerned that any improvements in tackling child poverty are in danger of being eroded by some government welfare policies children should not pay the price for the economic downturn the report updates groundbreaking work in by the bma that led to the creation of the childrens commissioner in vivienne nathanson director of professional

it seems that masculinity is in crisis again and this time the labour party is going to save us two leading mps are putting mens issues back on the political agenda with speeches about the other half of gender equality on monday labours policy coordinator jon cruddas said the conservatives have dominated the fatherhood debate using the stereotype of a feckless underclass of absent dads labour he says will value the role of fathers on thursday the partys shadow public health minister diane abbott will give a speech on britains crisis of masculinity where she will say that too many men and boys are isolated misdirected and remaining silent about manhood abbott in particular will place a specific focus on the importance of labour feminists developing a malefriendly narrative a nuance that points to the real issue here how do feminists deal with mens issues when we look at the evidence it is undeniable that men and boys as a distinct group face significant problems the gap between men and women applying to and entering university is growing they are much more likely to commit crime than women be homeless and between and for every single age group men were significantly more likely than women to take their own lives tackling these issues as gender problems can make a huge difference as the emergent men and boys sector is beginning to demonstrate through a number of small but significant grassroots projects successful mens organisations including calm a band of brothers young dads tv and the mankind initiative demonstrate that men of all ages and backgrounds are happy to talk when the people listening are positive about men what many of these projects demonstrate is that you dont need to take a feminist approach to be successful at tackling gender issues in fact even some of the most profeminist mens groups will tell you privately that feminist thinking can often be a barrier to helping men and boys a prime example is the field of sexual abuse where these groups claim that the womens sector has persuaded the government to exclude charities that specialise in helping male victims from its rape support fund this struggle between womens issues and mens issues is played out across the public and charitable sector and is rooted in the belief that gender equality is a womens problem often caused by men put simply women have problems and men are problems looking at a previews of abbotts speech it becomes apparent that labours new message about valuing fathers is underpinned with a familiar negative narrative about disaffected men who are hypermasculine homophobic misogynistic and obsessed with pornography abbott is right to say that there arent enough men engaged in conversations about manhood but is it any wonder when modern masculinity is described in such negative terms the best way to tackle the problems that men face is to follow the example of the womens sector and build a mens sector filled with independent organisations that are positive advocates for men and boys tackling mens issues in this way requires the womens sector to share the gender equality pie it also means allowing for a greater diversity of viewpoints which will ultimately challenge the dominance of feminist thinking in the gender equality sector faced with this eventuality it is inevitable that womens groups and feminist thinkers will resist attempts to target the problems that men and boys face and try to shift the focus back on to the problems that men and boys cause if the labour party is to tackle britains crisis of masculinity it will need to face up to the crisis that tackling mens issues creates for feminism the best way for labour to do this is by remaining true to the values of its own equalities legislation that allows for mens and womens issues to be addressed in an equitable and proportionate way cruddas got it right when he said we mustnt let negative perceptions about a minority of fathers shape policy for the majority if the rest of the party including labour feminists can apply that thinking to all mens issues we may move a step closer to tackling the crisis of masculinity,2013-05,seems masculinity crisis time labour

britain is facing a crisis of masculinity with rapid economic change warping male identity and encouraging machismo and misogyny the labour mp diane abbott will claim on thursday the shadow public health minister will say in her speech that unemployment and the economic downturn risks creating a generation of disaffected young men fuelling homophobia machismo and misogyny she will also say men are failing to discuss the problems they face its all become a bit like the film fight club the first rule of being a man in modern britain is that youre not allowed to talk about it the government must put the aim of full employment at its heart if these problems are to be solved she believes abbotts words signal a move by labour to capture the political battleground of the family from the tories it is the first of a number of speeches in which abbott will address the role of the modern family it follows comments by jon cruddas the partys policy review chief who said in may that labour could offer paid leave for fathers to attend antenatal classes and also ban advertising aimed at youngsters speaking to the thinktank demos abbott will argue that boys are becoming increasingly isolated from their parents and friends while grown men are working longer hours dying of preventable cancers and taking their own lives this generation no longer asks itself what it means to be a man she will say but she will also challenge the idea that a family unit should have two parents to be able to function in society let me be clear im not here to talk about broken britain im not here to do down singleparent families i am a single mother im not here to place blame on any families or to try and suggest that one particular family might be in some way better than another consumerism has replaced earning providing and belonging for many men according to the mp giving rise to a culture of hypermasculinity a culture that exaggerates what are perceived as manly qualities in the face of perceived threats at its worst its a celebration of heartlessness a lack of respect for womens autonomy and the normalisation of homophobia i fear its often crude individualism dressed up as modern manhood she will say pornography has also had a damaging affect upon men abbott claims which has added to the growth of a viagra and jack daniels culture growing numbers of men of all ages are turning to the drug by themselves due to performance anxiety triggered by a host of psychological issues from our increasingly pornified culture making normal sex seem boring to financial pressures it may be a secret psychological crutch for some men who are under pressure to meet a pornified expectation she will say labour policy suggestions are expected to include health campaigns aimed specifically at men to tackle obesity alcohol misuse and poor sexual health as well as promote fatherfriendly parenting classes which would be paid for from existing local government budgets schools would be asked to help youths to explore a less narrow version of masculinity and encourage parents to talk to their sons about manhood and fatherhood far from yesterdays role models of soldier miners and farmers male youths says abbott are part of a transit generation left working in services industries they are uncomfortable with or not working at all look at many of our young men graduating from university this year her speech says faced with mass unemployment and often unable to fly the nest they can find themselves locked into a transitional phase at home or find themselves voluntarily creating an extended adolescence sometimes resentful of family life,2013-05,britain facing crisis masculinity rapid economic change warping male identity encouraging machismo misogyny labour mp diane abbott claim thursday

labour has to recognise it will not be able to meet the expensive child poverty targets set by the previous labour government and must rethink its excessively centralised approach the head of the leading centreleft thinktank the ippr has said nick pearces warning came on monday as he spoke alongside jon cruddas the head of the labour policy review at a conference on childhood and the condition of britain in manchester cruddas is understood to be sympathetic to a new approach to tackling child poverty at the same event cruddas will set out plans for fathers to be given more opportunities to help in parenthood including more time to help during pregnancy cruddas has already suggested that the existing child poverty target needs rethinking saying that it had little popular support and the very language of child poverty is now arguably a barrier to progress rather than a call to action any explicit move to abandon the child poverty target would be highly controversial in the party but pearce a former no adviser under gordon brown remains highly influential in the labour party and his warning that the child poverty target is all but impossible to meet raises stark questions for the labour policy review he said labours attempt to end child poverty a relative poverty measure was so expensive it was running out of road even before never mind now at the same time its highly centralised even technocratic approach to tackling child poverty failed to speak to peoples everyday concerns about childhood not least those officially labelled as poor as a result labour struggled to secure widespread public support for its ambitions or mobilise families and communities behind them contrast this to the popular attachment generated for the newly created childrens centres labour facing mounting questions over the practical steps it will take to reduce the deficit will find it difficult to avoid this argument now it has been so openly aired by pearce the ippr director appeared to criticise the target to eliminate child poverty by and now enshrined in statute as wrong in policy design as well as prohibitively expensive he said the particular focus on internationally accepted definitions of poverty while unimpeachable in social policy terms pushed labour ministers to prioritise shortterm increases in cash benefits over longterm investment and reform to raise employment and wages among parents this left the strategy too reliant on the beneficence of the next budget and blown away by the fiscal implications of the financial crash families could end up as passive recipients of cash benefits with some feeling trapped in low pay and dependency he added labour could not plausibly commit the kind of resources required to achieve the targets through higher public spending he said labour should admit the target would take longer or different less statist means would be deployed he argued it is ultimately parents and their wider family and friendship networks that matter most a good childhood is only possible if families live strong common lives with others institutions like childrens centres support community life better than income transfers he said shifting the uk towards this kind of model would mean prioritising investment in childcare paid leave and employment programmes over cash benefits in a joint article written for the ippr journal juncture cruddas and liam byrne the shadow work and pensions secretary claim campaigners took much comfort from securing crossparty support for the child poverty act in the last parliament but this government has moved away from the targets that were set out in a piece of legislation that some now see as embodying the limits of an empirical rather than emotional approach and has in any case been overwhelmed by the economic headwinds of the last few years in his speech on monday cruddas will say that for too long the debate about fatherhood has been dominated by conservative stereotypes about a feckless underclass of absent dads instead labour will be discussing what more the government can do to help the majority of fathers to play a role in their childrens lives but who increasingly feel the system does not help them do so he will say that as part of developing a more familyfriendly economy labour is exploring whether expectant fathers should have the same statutory right to paid time off work as women to attend key antenatal appointments he will claim the challenge of modern fatherhood isnt one about some imagined underclass its about fathers up and down the country who want to do the right thing but cant the failure of our economy has left us with a living standards crisis but it has also put pressure on modern parenthood too often that has meant women dropping out of the

the latest analysis of child poverty figures from the institute for fiscal studies reiterates yet again that the goal of ending child poverty by as enshrined in the child poverty act is now all but impossible to meet relative income poverty among families with children looks set to rise considerably over the next decade cancelling out all of the progress made under the labour government labours attempt to end child poverty generated improvements in family incomes that benefited millions of children but as the ifs figures show it relied on ever higher levels of public spending a strategy that was running out of road even before never mind now at the same time its highly centralised even technocratic approach to tackling child poverty failed to speak to peoples everyday concerns about childhood not least those officially labeled as poor as a result labour struggled to secure widespread public support for its ambitions or to mobilise families and communities behind them contrast this to the popular attachment generated for the newly created childrens centres the particular focus on internationally accepted definitions of poverty while unimpeachable in social policy terms pushed labour to prioritise shortterm increases in cash benefits over longterm investment and reform to raise employment and wages among parents this left the strategy too reliant on the beneficence of the next budget and blown away by the fiscal implications of the financial crash families could end up as passive recipients of cash benefits with some feeling trapped in low pay and dependency these are some of the important insights emerging from a new programme of work at ippr on the condition of britain in which we are rethinking the centrelefts approach to major social policy challenges no one wants to see more children living in poverty but a future labour government could not plausibly commit the kind of resources required to achieve the targets through higher public spending what are the options when faced with this reality campaigners on the left continue to press for greater spending or perhaps more accurately for fewer cuts now this is admirable but does not have a plausible chance of success voices on the right say the goal should be abandoned or redefined meanwhile the coalition government refuses formally to abandon the targets but pushes through benefit cuts that make them impossible to meet perhaps the worst response of all there is another path this would be to say that ending child poverty remains vital but will take longer than we hoped and will need to be pursued through different means to those used in the past first while income matters a lot it also matters where that income comes from earning enough to live a decent life is better than relying heavily on cash transferred to you from the state although the tax and benefit system will always have a role in supporting families with children second while government has a crucial role to play in enabling children to thrive it is ultimately parents and their wider family and friendship networks that matter most a good childhood is only possible if families live strong common lives with others institutions such as childrens centres support community life better than income transfers moreover they are much harder to cut or abolish the twin challenges now are to identify strategic priorities for public investment and economic reforms to lift family incomes and to develop a new statecraft with which to tackle poverty rooted in peoples lives on priorities a good place to start would be families with young children since the early years matter most for child development thats when the pressures of time and money really bite and in an era of limited public budgets rising living standards will have to come from higher employment among parents and rising wages rather than simply through more tax credits and inwork benefits this is the approach taken by the lowpoverty countries that tony blair was trying emulate when he pledged to end child poverty back in in the nordic nations relatively few children live with parents who dont work many more lone parents are in work than in britain and more mothers in couples also work dualearner couples with children face much lower rates of poverty less than in britain compared to nearly among singleearner couples public spending is focused on younger children through more generous parental leave and good quality universal childcare rather than cash benefits spread across all children inwork benefits tend to be less generous partly because fewer parents face endemic low pay while investment in backtowork support is much stronger shifting the uk towards this kind of model would mean prioritising investment in childcare paid leave and employment programmes over cash benefits freezing child benefit in cash terms for a decade would free up bn a year to invest in quality childcare services while billions more a year could come from restricting tax relief for pension contributions to the basic rate beyond public spending radical economic reforms are needed to lift wages and tackle low pay such as a more ambitious role for the minimum wage or a new expectation that companies will share profits with their staff there is a world of difference between the aspiration of work paying more than benefits and work that pays enough to live on these reform priorities coupled with a new approach that puts families centrestage should form the backbone of a revived child poverty strategy that reflects the new

nick clegg has joined a chorus of concerned childminders nursery providers and parents unconvinced by liz trusss proposals that relaxing child ratios will improve quality or drive down costs these concerns have been voiced since truss first suggested them a survey by the national childrens bureau revealed that of respondents were concerned about increasing ratios professor cathy nutbrown who advised the government on childcare has commented that the ratio plans make no sense at all and online petitions have gathered significant resistance to reform the childminding forum has amassed almost signatures with concerns that relaxing ratios will threaten health safety and wellbeing of children and the preschool learning alliances rewind on ratios campaign is petitioning the government to scrap its plans on childcare ratio changes collecting over signatures to date a day of action has even been called for june for the childcare sector to unite to challenge the governments proposals in new research shortly to be published by ippr with childminders this message is reiterated this survey asks childminders their views as many are considering how to adapt to the potential changes in september it gives us the most uptodate picture about how this sector might respond seventyfour per cent of childminders say they wont increase the number of children they care for of those wont because they think the quality of care will suffer with saying it would also pose a safety risk to children when asked to consider the impact of increasing the number of children they cared for at any one time thought it would have no effect on cost to parents with less than thinking that they would decrease the amount they charged parents per child five per cent thought they might increase parental fees the governments response to all this evidence has typically been that ratios are looser in other european countries especially france but this is because the qualifications attained by the early years workforce in france are generally higher so using ratios as an indicator for costs is limited given the different levels and status of qualifications it is a real stretch to suggest that slightly looser ratios will lead to lower prices and higher salaries cleggs reservations on ratios are welcome and suggest that there is genuine concern on how to best improve child outcomes but there are other parts of the governments childcare package where he would be well placed to also be sceptical namely proposals on tax relief working parents will be eligible to claim up to taxfree for childcare costs but tax relief tends to be regressive skewed towards higher income families analysis by the resolution foundation shows that only families in the bottom of the income distribution will qualify for new help compared to million families in the top by income at a cost of about bn pounds this proposal is not likely to deliver for the hardworking families struggling with the highcosts of childcare ippr has long argued that this money would be better spent investing in early years services widening access and increasing affordability if clegg approaches tax relief with the same

a previously hidden coalition clash over childcare has burst into the open as a conservative minister rejected concerns expressed by the deputy prime minister nick clegg that her plans could damage the quality of childcare and fail to achieve savings the childcare minister elizabeth truss was summoned to the commons on thursday to answer an urgent question on the future of plans to relax childtostaff ratios in england labour said the row was another example of chaos and incompetence at the heart of the coalition and said it would force a commons vote on the issue truss told mps the government was considering responses to a consultation on the plans and would make further announcements in due course she had proposed increasing the number of underones each adult can look after from three to four and the number of twoyearolds from four to six the number of threeyearolds would stay at eight or children per adult depending on whether a qualified graduate was present clegg said on thursday he was concerned that plans to reduce the ratio of childcare staff to children would represent too great a challenge for childminders and nursery workers and the issue was being reviewed in government truss told the commons england had the tightest ratios in europe for children under three and the lowest staff salaries in ireland and germany each staff member could look after six twoyearolds in france workers could look after eight youngsters and in denmark and sweden there were no national staff ratios at all she said our evidence suggests department for education economists have looked at this in detail that nurseries will be able to pay higher staff salaries and reduce costs to parents she added failing to reform the supply of childcare would make the cost prohibitive for parents who wanted to go to work she said the shadow education secretary stephen twigg said the ink was not dry on the queens speech when we learned that the government might in fact be uturning on its policy he said isnt this yet another example of chaos and incompetence at the heart of government policymaking labour will table an amendment to the children and families bill at report stage which is due to be debated in the next few weeks twigg who is chairing the partys childcare commission said childcare workers did not want the additional risk of having to look after as many as six twoyearolds at a time he said parents dont want to put the safety of their young children at risk this government is presiding over a crisis in childcare families have seen help through tax credits cut by and sure start centres closing down now the quality of care is at risk too truss acknowledged that opinion is divided within the british academic establishment as it is on many educational issues but she said these policies are alive and well in france in ireland in holland in germany there is not a single country including scotland where the ratios are as low as they are here in england the truss proposals emerged after months of wrangling between the coalition parties and have been sharply criticised by the preschool alliance and parent groups such as mumsnet the deputy prime minister speaking on his weekly lbc radio phonein programme said the issue had been under discussion for weeks and weeks adding that he was as surprised as anyone else that the story had appeared overnight the task of one adult looking after six twoyearolds was a nightmare he said adding that he was passionate about better quality and more affordable childcare clegg said it is not a great ideological thing it is about getting it right for parents up and down the country when the last government changed the socalled ratios for three and fouryearolds it had almost no effect in reducing the costs for parents whatsoever so you do need to be led by the evidence and that is what i will continue to be in the debate he added that a lot of the evidence in the consultation suggested there was a tradeoff between quality and quantity i would challenge you to spend a morning look after six twoyearolds he said clegg said it was vital that the government got the decision right he stressed the proposals did not jeopardise plans to offer free childcare tax breaks worth for two parents planned for saying the income stream for those plans came from elsewhere the prime ministers spokesman said the government had consulted on the issue and was considering its response to the views it has received asked if the prime minister was aware of his deputys concerns the spokesman said david cameron and clegg discussed all aspects of government policy it was a topic of concern for very many families it is an issue that the government has been discussing internally as you would expect because we are bringing forward proposals he said he added the uk has some of the most expensive childcare in europe as well as the tightest ratios and the government is committed to improving accessibility to highquality childcare justine roberts chief executive and founder of the mumsnet website said its users would be mighty relieved by cleggs stance put simply parents believe that the quality of care will be adversely affected by the proposed changes and that even with a gcse in maths and english four babies under one or six undertwos is a lot for even the most experienced childcare worker to manage she said only of mumsnet users supported a change in ratios even if it meant lower costs thats why mumsnet supports the preschool learning alliances rewind on ratios

nick clegg will have won many friends in the education research community by threatening to block one of the coalitions key education reforms a proposed rise in the number of young children a nursery worker or childminder can look after in england leading educationalists such as prof kathy sylva of oxford university and brenda taggart of the institute of education university of london have shown that the governments plan to relax the ratios of children to adults will have a particularly detrimental effect on those under three nurseries will be less able to provide for childrens individual needs their paper more great childcare or not research evidence states liz truss the childcare minister wants nursery workers and childminders to have far better qualifications ideally they should be graduates she says as they are in france she laments how many in england have little more than basic maths and english but the researchers say that as far as children under three are concerned having graduatelevel carers will not undo the damaging effects of having more children for each adult for three to fiveyearolds however the picture is different studies show that if earlyyears carers have better qualifications and the number of children per adult rises the quality of the care will stay the same rather than go down its hardly a ringing endorsement for the reforms one of the major studies on early years the effective preschool primary and secondary education project has found that children under the care of childminders will miss out most of all from the governments reforms a rich early years home learning environment which includes reading to children playing with numbers and letters and walking to the library has longterm benefits the coalitions proposals will lead to a less rich experience the study says indeed safety concerns will make informal outings virtually impossible it says the government believes england is out of step with its neighbours our nursery workers can look after four twoyearolds compared with six twoyearolds in the netherlands and eight in france but the problem researchers say is that we have no way of comparing how good these nurseries are to ours the government merely states that just of our nurseries and childminders are given an outstanding rating by ofsted ryan shorthouse of the social market foundation whose report a better beginning was scrutinised by ministers before the reforms were announced admits that comparing early years settings across countries is problematic its pretty ambiguous when it comes to saying what the perfect ratio is he says however what is clear he says is that betterqualified staff do improve quality of care the ideal is to keep ratios as they are but ensure staff have better qualifications he says education researchers agree but this would cost extra money and so for the moment is most certainly off the cards,2013-05,nick clegg many friend education research community

the child poverty act of holds the government accountable for reducing child poverty on wednesday new figures from the institute for fiscal studies show that not only are they failing to do so the numbers of children living in poverty will actually rise from million to million by the date that was set for the elimination of child poverty in the uk the last government missed its target on child poverty reduction but we should not forget what it did achieve child poverty rose steeply under thatcher and by the time labour came to power million children were poor labour got that down to million during its years in power now all the hardwon progress is unravelling child poverty in the uk that means living on less than of the average income is not an inevitable aspect of modern societies or technological change or even a temporary effect of the global recession child poverty is a persistent problem in the uk and we do much worse than many other rich developed nations including some that have a much lower level of gdp the latest report on child wellbeing in advanced economies from unicef shows that the uk ranks joint th with hungary on child poverty and several countries including ireland france slovenia iceland and the czech republic achieve lower levels of child poverty than we do in the uk on substantially lower per capita income indeed in hungary the average income is half that of the uk so persistent and high levels of child poverty are not about economic growth they are about how that growth is shared out and the choices we make in terms of goals and policies it is not enough to have reports and initiatives that talk about improving life chances or to waste time consulting on a new approach that misguidedly mixes up the causes and consequences of poverty when millions of childrens lives are being blighted and child poverty is set to rise poverty has a profound impact on children on their families and on the rest of society what happens in early childhood affects physical cognitive and social development and sets children on a lifelong trajectory encompassing educational attainment economic participation and physical and mental health poor children do worse at every educational stage they have a smaller vocabulary by the age of three only are performing at the expected level when they enter school compared to of children who are not poor by the time they get to university age only of poor children will go on to higher education compared to of their nonpoor peers and children living in poverty will suffer worse health throughout their lifetimes between and life expectancy at birth for boys in the lowest social class was almost six years shorter than those in the top group and for girls the difference was four years anybody with the slightest imagination can also glimpse the painful psychological reality of growing up poor if ministers believe that child poverty is simply a problem of broken families they are wrong other countries with high levels of single parenthood dont have our high levels of child poverty and their children have higher levels of wellbeing in all domains if they think that children are only poor because their parents are feckless and workshy theyre also wrong the majority of poor children live in working households if you think child poverty doesnt affect you you couldnt be more wrong as taxpayers we spend heavily on social support and housing benefit for poor families subsidising the true cost of lowpaid work and lining the pockets of private landlords we spend yet more on addressing the problems caused by child poverty in education and health services youth justice and beyond social mobility is stagnant in the uk much lower than in countries such as canada and germany children in

one in four children in britain million will be in relative poverty by the institute for fiscal studies ifs has warned in a report conducted for the northern ireland executive but held to describe the position in the uk as a whole the ifs says tax and benefit reforms introduced since april can account for almost all of the increases in child poverty projected over the next few years the shakeup will result in another children falling into relative poverty during this parliament with this figure rising by more than million by the ifs says the jump will result in britain missing binding targets to reduce child poverty by the target was to reduce child poverty to one in or fewer of all children or about million the ifs the countrys leading public finance thinktank warns that it seems impossible the targets set out in the child poverty act could be met and recommends the government now needs to reveal a credible plan for meeting the targets it has signed up to or that it sets different objectives which reflect its view of what is both desirable and achievable in the report which was conducted for the northern ireland executive but considered a panuk position the institute says warns the coalition that tax and benefit reforms introduced since april can account for almost all of the increases in child poverty projected over the next few years it also discounts the idea that the governments welfare reforms would be able to change poverty levels despite the impact of universal credit the overall impact of reforms introduced since april is to increase the level of income poverty in each and every year from to in an update to work first done in october the ifs considered the spectrum of welfare changes and calculated that the number of children in absolute

charities warned that a generation was being failed alison garnham of child poverty action group said we always put our childrens needs first in family life and we should do as a nation too but todays dire projections reveal we are in danger of failing the next generation the government has child poverty targets and a child poverty strategy because it knows poverty destroys life chances and generates huge costs to our economy a child is considered to be in relative poverty if he or she lives in a household whose income is below of the average in that year and in absolute poverty if he or she lives in a household whose realterms income is below of the average a period set as a benchmark in this years child poverty act the work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith has argued for a

conflates the causes of poverty with the consequences a dwp spokesman said despite paying out bn in tax credits alone the previous government failed to meet their target to halve child poverty by and far too many children were left behind that is why we want to take a new approach by tackling the root causes of poverty including worklessness educational failure and family breakdown the ifs

is this all that was the question that echoed around a generation of us housewives in the early s theirs was the problem with no name wrote betty friedan in her bestseller the feminine mystique and the symptoms were legion they included creeping fatigue tranquiliser and alcohol abuse bleeding blisters that appeared suddenly on their arms which doctors attributed not to the cleaning fluids they used constantly but a deeper malaise in the years since the war women had grown smaller department store buyers reported they had shrunk three or four dress sizes more feminine of women dyed their hair blond and apparently much sadder that icon of femininity marilyn monroe had died of an overdose the year before and sylvia plath just as outwardly feminine but with a hidden crackling rage killed herself in london in her death came not long after she published her novel the bell jar it was the story of esther greenwood who goes to new york to take up an internship at a womens magazine as plath once had before finding she can never quite match her inner life to the perfect face she has to present a desperate exaggerated femininity was being held up as an ideal for all women in january gloria steinem then a freelance journalist packed her leotard in a hat box and auditioned to become a playboy bunny in an undercover assignment for show magazine steinem exposed the low pay sexual harassment and racism black women were sniggeringly referred to as chocolate bunnies and later when she had become a feminist leader wrote that all women were treated as bunnies a us debate that had started tentatively with president john f kennedys commission on the status of women blew up with friedans book and continued in with the creation of the national organisation for women which friedan initially led these ideas began floating over to the uk the feminist historian sheila rowbotham has said she began hearing arguments for womens liberation from the us and germany around it was an age of early marriage in britain and larger families the average age of first marriage for women in was compared with today the average woman in had children in her lifetime while now she has the contraceptive pill arrived in the uk in but was mainly prescribed to married women it wasnt until that it became widely freely available in her memoir promise of a dream rowbotham writes that as a student in the early s not only were we all ignorant about contraception but we had no idea who we could ask for advice abortion an inconceivable horror of gin and screams was still illegal that changed in with the passing of the abortion act women were yoked to men economically not just because they earned much less in for instance womens earnings as a proportion of mens earnings were but because they often needed a signature from their father or husband to gain credit or buy bigger items the economic debate sharpened suddenly in when women at the ford plant in dagenham went on strike for equal pay that same year the observer reported on an official study that showed a massive wastage of womens abilities and qualifications and at least four million women used virtually as slave labour half of britains working women were earning less than five shillings an hour the dagenham strike led to the equal pay act in followed by the sex discrimination act in but with only of mps being women in much of the action to change womens lives naturally took place at the grassroots the proportion of female mps actually came in below in every subsequent election until when it rose to a paltry in women organised a protest at the annual miss world contest in london that same year the first national womens liberation conference formulated demands for equal pay equal education and opportunity hour nurseries free contraception and abortion on demand the following years brought the first national womens liberation march the magazine spare rib the publishing house virago the first

is sisterhood sacred or soulcrushing within the feminist movement the answer is less clear than one might hope trashing each other and exclusion have been hallmarks since the movement began and each generation of feminist activists seems to suffer the same infighting but contrary to simplistic ideas about catty backstabbing women feminists dont fight each other because women are uniquely competitive or cruel though we care about the movement it happens because weve internalized a narrative of scarcity we act as though were fighting for crumbs in her recent new yorker article about the life of the feminist pioneer shulamith firestone susan faludi details how the womens liberation movement of the s and s fractured she quotes a line from tigrace atkinsons resignation from a new york feminist group sisterhood is powerful it kills mostly sisters it seems that no one walked away unscathed and today little has changed online feminism faces many of the same challenges our foremothers faced not enough support too much attention for the dominant groups vicious internal attacks and bitter frustration and disillusionment the same dynamics of trashing that jo freeman wrote about in are alive today trashing she says is not about opposition or critique it is not done to expose disagreements or resolve differences it is done to disparage and destroy that dynamic is of course not unique to feminism is there any social movement that hasnt had splits arguments and active dissent disagreement that escalates into attacks should be expected on the left where we value dissent and diverse opinions the right too sees its fair share of infighting but being conservative it can be somewhat insulated from it by a resistance to change and a cultural deference to authority progressive movements lend themselves more readily to discord which in the big picture is a good thing identitybased movements may be particularly susceptible precisely because of our personal investment in them feminism isnt just a general ideology for making the world a better place its a very specific ideology of liberation for the actors of the movement it is personal by definition challenges to the movement or the sense that other women are somehow doing feminism wrong can feel like personal affronts for feminists your work often feels like a reflection of who you are and the critiques even more so that passion and deep concern for a social movement are strengths but women make up half the world of course our ideas vary wildly about what a representative movement should be and while nearly all of us have good intentions intentions dont make perfect outcomes feminist movements have too many times perpetuated existing hierarchies and certain bigotries often lifting the experiences of the most powerful usually upper middleclass straight white american women while steamrolling the perspectives of the many women who dont fit that mold in a more perfect world or at least a more perfect movement we could have a variety of feminisms each serving a variety of women and all recognizing the fact that woman as a category encompasses all sorts of different human beings with different needs we wouldnt need to draw exact lines around who is or isnt an acceptable feminist feminism would be bigtent so long as you work to promote social political and economic gender equality youre in no one would be expected to speak for all of womankind sheryl sandberg could write a book about gender in the business world without facing attacks from other feminists criticizing her for having a nanny for talking to male ceos more than female domestic laborers or for not representing workingclass women the takeaway being that sandberg isnt enough of a caretaker and therefore not sufficiently feminine and in a more perfect world or movement a feminist book written by a female domestic laborer would get as much traction as one penned by the coo of facebook the solution to those imperfections though is not to attack the women who do succeed or stand out that only creates a movement of kneejerk critics who when presented with a piece of feminist work engage the find whats wrong with it mode and theres the problem of scarcity feminist work is rarely paid and when feminist writers and activists are compensated its not usually with much in their new femfuture report about online feminism pdf bloggers and activists courtney martin and vanessa valenti detail what they call a psychology of deprivation it is a sense that their work will never be rewarded as it deserves to be that they are in direct competition with one another for the scraps that come from thirdparty ad companies or other inadequate attempts to bring in revenue as a result they are vulnerable less effective and risk burn out under these conditions online feminism isnt being sufficiently linked to larger organizational and movement efforts andor leveraged for the greatest impact at this critical moment as such feminists routinely see their work immediately picked apart by other feminists much like the trashing jo freeman and susan faludi detail interfeminist discourse often dips into character assassination but theres also personal attack masquerading as critique and its nearly impossible to draw a line separating the two although ann friedman does a good job with this handy chart thoughtful criticism meant to improve a project is a good thing the explicit intent of finding fault in a work is not going a step further and suggesting that a projects flaws and gaps reflect the motives of its creators theyre corporate sellouts dont care about x group of women just want to promote themselves is what kneecaps activism why act at all if the social norm in your group is to chew up and spit out every new idea unsurprisingly the femfuture report was met with the usual criticismforcriticismssake but also thankfully some thoughtful and cogent suggestions for improvement within the feminist blogosphere though a paper meant to make our work more sustainable was only lightly promoted there was little recognition of its many strengths and even fewer pledges to help make sustainable online feminism real its not because supporters dont exist its because many of us were scared to wade into a sudden conflict we didnt want to be perceived as insufficiently critical sellouts or too aggressive you know not sufficiently accommodating too ambitious not sufficiently feminine that has real consequences i have spoken to countless women who have ideas for books blogs campaigns or other projects but are terrified to carry them out lest they make a misstep and be branded a bad feminist unworthy of support theyd rather keep their heads down than put out new ideas better to join the chorus of critics and position oneself as a good feminist in opposition to those other bad feminists thats not the sign of a healthy movement but it is how one earns credibility in online feminist circles today nothing looks better than pointing out how everyone else is doing it wrong bonus points if those other feminists have had a modicum of success like a book a highlytrafficked website or getting paid for their work but its not because were catty or mean or somehow predisposed to cliquishness and competition its because were starving which is why i hope despite the initial pushback that the many suggestions for online activism presented in the femfuture report materialize i hope that the report is only one small piece of an enormous global movement of women online and off taking a look at their own communities and asking what do we need here how can we make our work sustainable there isnt a set pie of feminist support attention money and influence the more widereaching our movement is the more opportunities there will be for everyone in it most of us never chose feminism as a career choice most feminists earn their salary in other ways even those of us who are paid for feminist work arent exactly in it for the big bucks but we all need some sort of support whether its financial emotional structural or something else and too few of us receive it its time we learned lessons that are now decades old and have been faced by many other political movements feminism must be more genuinely egalitarian and representative we need to understand that womanhood means very different things to the billions of different women on this planet we must work against perpetuating the same inequalities we fight against and we need to do that not in competition with each other but with the shared goal of improving the movement and world we need to do it with the recognition that no perspective or solution will be universal and no single woman will be anywhere near a perfect feminist then we can stop fighting for scraps and instead work on making a feast,2013-05,sisterhood sacred soulcrushing within feminist movement answer less clear one might hope trashing exclusion

five months ago i was not a politician and nor did i feel my gender had any bearing on my career or that of my peers that all changed on november when i won the rotherham byelection and became a mp labours emma lewellbuck faces the same prospect if she wins in the south shields byelection today i quickly became aware that being a woman was a factor when i was knocking on doors during the election campaign the women i met were genuinely surprised and delighted that i was standing and felt a shared sense of pride that i could become the first female mp of their town often daughters were brought to meet me and they were told look you could do this when you grow up almost without exception women told me we needed more women in politics and i could definitely count on their vote and vote they did i was not part of an allwomen shortlist though it happened to be two women who were put forward for selection i know some people have strong feelings against allwomen shortlists and i can understand why it does seem a heavyhanded approach to address an imbalance but the problem is that imbalance definitely exists with only of mps being women byelections often have low turnout and political organisers here and in the us report that people who generally do not like politicians because they think that we dont get their lives feel more encouraged to vote when there is a woman standing they feel that women as outsiders in the political process are more trustworthy and more in touch with everyday matters ideally we would start showing young people that a career in politics whether at local regional or national level is viable for them regardless of sex the reality is that approach will take years to create strong candidates who can be selected entirely on merit with a system that understands the inherent sexism in our existing process and addresses it positive action does not promote weak candidates what it does is actively find strong candidates who would never normally get a chance to demonstrate their suitability i am proud to be a member of a party that does that labour aims to have representation in parliament and if we win the byelection today there will have been four labour women and seven labour men elected in byelections since its a step in the right direction without labours strong record britain would be near the bottom of the european league for the proportion of women in parliament close to montenegro in order for democracy to work our government should reflect the makeup of society let us start with the most obvious inequality

the other day a perfectly nice chap opened the door for me in a restaurant so i spat in his face and started ululating greenham style another man offered me a seat on the bus so i kneed him in the groin because i am a feminist and this is how feminists behave right of course i did not do these things nor have i ever met a woman who has despite the fact that i am from the paleolithic era when diana rigg spouted this nonsense the old i like having doors opened for me line i wondered where the myth comes from mostly i see women bumping buggies down the steps at train stations while no one helps riggss quaint ideas about feminism are hardly new she likes male attention and thinks feminism is just women who moan and carp about it get real joanna lumley with her remarks about how women shouldnt get drunk and walk around late at night or mary berry on the difficulty of employing women as they get pregnant do us no favours indeed feminisms greatest problem has always been womens collusion in their own oppression which is massively complex we are a diverse bunch rigg talked of equal pay which certainly does not feature much in her line of work but when we get access to abortion or maternity leave or any of the benefits for which some women tirelessly campaign i dont notice any of these gosh i am so successful i dont need feminism types refusing these gains what is heartening in the midst of the current backlash and yes it is a fullscale backlash rising unemployment for women a tory government pushing women back into the home the targeting of single parents is to see some women in the public eye fighting back it may be superficial but they are refusing the hypercritical gaze that is directed at all women katherine jenkins dished it back when she ran a marathon looking cool mary beard has done the same the monstering can happen to anyone suddenly claudia winklemans fringe is a serious problem hello houston this is just hair here to hear myleene klass describe herself as a strident feminist this week made me almost as happy as being lost in the sea of spanx and oestrogen that was seeing beyonc live klass bemoaned the horrid culture that criticises women all the time women are so good when theyre helping each other of course klass has since committed a crime against leggings and doubtless the witless slagging off it occasioned was written by a woman solidarity or sisterhood is as distant as it ever was which is why i have been arguing for a backtobasics version of feminism angry birds i call it for some time we need to be pushing for what we can agree on and form alliances internationally on reproductive rights equal pay education for girls freedom from rape one of the problems with the jargon of intersectionality is that it splinters much on trend feminism has lost touch as it is overdetermined by sexuality whether we are discussing sex workers trans issues or porn the overriding differences between women are far less sexy they remain largely to do with class if feminism is to mean anything to most women it has to mean an extension of their choices alison wolfs new book the xx factor documents how the top to educated and successful of women are pulling away from the rest of womanhood they do not share the circumstances of most women as we see with the concomitant rise of the servant class the old domestic labour problem has not gone away it has been outsourced i disagree that it is only this class of executive have it all women who find motherhood boring looking after a baby can be a boring and lonely experience for a woman of any class it is just that this elite group has the means to pay for childcare and get back to an interesting job a meaningful feminism would not split us into mothers and nonmothers or privilege sexuality above all it would also understand that globalisation has produced homogeneity for women at a basic level we are all to be caucasian with lifted bottoms and long hair even differences in appearance are now deviant in allencompassing celebrity culture this makes it even harder to talk about the actual differences between us we dont all think the same we dont all come from the same place or have the same amount of money but we remain locked out of the allmale cliques that run the world when we make a gain when women are granted just a tiny bit more freedom a tinge of equality it is not rationed to those who worked to get it you know that policeman who believes you were assaulted that boss who gave you maternity leave that morningafter pill you took that man you could leave even though you had his baby these things were made possible by other women they opened the really important doors for you thats feminism when men open the door for you it is

a new approach to vulnerable families is urgently needed thats the conclusion of our inquiry into children in care published on wednesday in early eight chief executives of charities working with children and families in england got together to discuss approaches to finding permanent homes for children in and on the edge of care all eight support the governments desire to speed up decisionmaking and to strengthen support after adoption but adoption will only ever be the best option for a small minority of children who cant live with their birth parents and we need a similar level of commitment to improving the life chances of all children in care and so the care inquiry was born its remit to investigate how best to provide stable and permanent homes for all vulnerable children in england who cannot live with their birth parents in addition to consulting directors of childrens services politicians academics managers and practitioners we heard evidence from more than care leavers adoptees adopters social workers foster carers kinship carers and birth families all stressed the importance of relationships for children but found that all too often the care system is better at breaking relationships than making them too many children have too many moves between homes and whether the system works in providing them with a permanent stable place to live often seems to be a matter of luck important relationships are being broken for these children whether that be with birth parents siblings other family members previous foster carers social workers friends or teachers problems within the care system are not new but there is increasing strain in the lives of vulnerable children and families because of increases in unemployment and poverty and changes to the benefit system public sector budget cuts are preventing local authorities from fully discharging their duty of care to these young people and their families central and local government must rethink the purpose of care and the way in which the most vulnerable children and families are treated all care options returning home kinship care adoption foster care special guardianship and residential care must be seen as equally valid and given the same political financial and cultural priority a more flexible response is needed with support to families varying in intensity as their circumstances change and with support based on need not legal status this will help to ensure that children in need can stay at home or return home safely and that those who cant are supported to develop and maintain permanent relationships this requires changes in practice and a cultural shift whitehall local authorities and those working in the care system must focus more on the importance of relationships than on legal status the care inquiry has identified steps to achieving this now it is the responsibility of all of us in the sector to make sure these changes become a reality robert tapsfield is chief executive of the fostering network and chair of the care inquiry steering group,2013-05,new approach vulnerable family urgently needed thats conclusion inquiry child care published

after years of economic growth and a worldclass welfare system there is something fundamentally wrong when australian children currently live below the poverty line whilst poverty persistently resists amelioration our body politic denies to the indigent the possibility to forge a better future for themselves and their children euphemistically captioned policies are headlined as welfare to work or fair incentives to work although enthusiastically supported by the major parties the fact is they continue to plunge families into penury at an increasing rate the glaring and disgraceful social wounds of child poverty threaten our capacity for empathy and compassion by their very intransigence the causes of child poverty are many and varied there is stark evidence however that poverty is generationally entrenched in households where no one is in the paid work force moving people to lower welfare support payments without removing the multiple barriers to work is counterproductive it simply adds to australias swelling ranks of the homeless and hungry the recent household income and labour dynamic in australia hilda survey by the university of melbourne sounded the alarm on child poverty finding that the rate of lone parent child poverty has jumped since additional demand for services from the underfunded nongovernment charitable sector is at now at breaking point amongst the barriers to employment are affordability and accessibility of childcare secure housing the cost and availability of transport and access to further education and training over the past decade successive changes to welfare have missed a chance to implement reforms that could lift poor australian families out of poverty in june the social security legislation amendment fair incentives to work bill inflicted an cut in payments to over single parents at a time when the cost of living was skyrocketing power bills alone had increased by over that bill was an extension of the welfare to work reforms introduced in it removed the grandfather clauses that allowed single parents to claim the parenting payment until their youngest child turned now when the youngest child turns eight single sole parents will be abruptly moved onto the lower unemployment payment known as newstart the salvation army along with the australian council of social service the un rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights and business groups all assert that this change has placed families at increased risk of poverty a sole parent with no earnings and studying to acquire new skills who is caring for a primary school aged child will be per week worse off under the new arrangements newstart now equates to a welfare benefit of just per day it is a pitiful amount instead of moving people from welfare to work they are moved from welfare to worse so why the doublespeak as american writer e b white said prejudice is a great time saver you can form opinions without having to get the facts prejudice lies at the heart of the simplistic mantra that welfare recipients are dole bludgers or welfare cheats it sits with cruel irony against the increase in middle class welfare that has been effortlessly sanctioned at the expense of children in poverty this will have consequences beyond our imagining why does the plight of children in poverty not engender moral outrage why are we apparently indifferent to the plight of children under lock and key in detention centres particularly as government policy states that no child will be placed in detention except as a last resort throughout the past decade almost every australian human rights commissioner and ombudsman has warned the government of the dangers that mandatory detention poses to children a report by the human rights and equal opportunity commission into the detention of children bluntly said that the policy constituted cruel inhumane and degrading punishment a plethora of parliamentary committee reports has also issued dire warnings on the harm caused to children in detention as recently as just six months before the government revived the pacific solution a committee headed by labor mp daryl melham received an avalanche of submissions indicating that the detention of children remained anathema throughout the wider community the treatment of so many children in distress whether homegrown or in detention is a painful indication of shameless indifference or at the very least ineptitude by government,2013-06,year economic growth worldclass welfare system something fundamentally wrong

a step towards tackling the crisis in representation for women will be taken if the bank of england changes tack and puts an historic woman on one of britains banknotes ed miliband said on thursday the labour leader challenged the outgoing bank governor sir mervyn king who said that jane austen was quietly waiting in the wings to appear on the new note by saying that a woman should appear immediately king prompted a storm of protests when he said that the queen would be the only woman to appear on banknotes when winston churchill replaces the prison reformer elizabeth fry on the note in in a speech to women in advertising and communications london miliband said when winston churchill replaces elizabeth fry on the note everyone who will appear on notes issued by the bank of england will be a man what kind of signal does that send i read this week that jane austen is quietly waiting in the wings to appear on a banknote one day but years on from the great struggle to give women the right to vote women shouldnt be waiting quietly in the wings for anything this is an important symbol of the kind of country we are why dont we have one of our great women scientists like elizabeth garrett anderson and a suffragette like emmeline pankhurst on our banknotes the labour leader said progress had been made towards greater gender equality as he noted that women made up of the shadow cabinet but he said we face a crisis of representation in our culture now we all know the changes our culture has gone through in recent years many of those are good greater prominence is given to fantastic role models for women and girls than there were in the past clare balding doreen lawrence jk rowling jocelyn bell burnell as well as many of you present here tonight it also about how people are seen about the images we have of each other because it is partly from those images we learn to interact there is a culture of increasingly sexualised images among young people a culture that says that girls will only get on in life if they live up to the crudest of stereotypes a culture where pornographic images some violent are available at a click on a smartphone or a laptop like any parent i worry about this there are things that can be done including safer default settings on our computers it puts a greater responsibility on all of us to do what we can to counter these images and not just by doing all we can to protect children in schools and on the internet schools should always ensure the aspirations of girls and boys are encouraged and schools should offer proper relationship education at all key stages to ensure all our children have a proper chance to understand what they have a right to expect,2013-06,step towards tackling crisis representation woman taken

i am a professional feminist much to my fathers stated disappointment i make my living from feminist commentary and advocacy i write articles organise marches host a talkshow create podcasts appear on radio and television raise money for donations speak at conferences and intervene in the public sphere in order to promote the cause of feminism this probably makes me the opposite of leisure feminists as described by helen razer last week the fact that i do this doesnt make me more or less of a feminist than other people but it certainly means im familiar with the types of criticism feminists receive that the censure from razer and others is equally scathing whether youre a leisure feminist or a professional feminist is representative of the fact that feminism will always be dismissed on some grounds by someone in particularly vituperative ways whether its internalised contempt for womens voices personal insecurity or something else feminists are often attacked just for being feminists besides the rape threats and comments on my appearance your ugly sic i often read comments by people who genuinely think that feminism is bad or as my grandfather wouldve said those outside the tent pissing in theyre the easiest to ignore because i know theyre wrong im certain that feminism is a noble movement for equality striving to liberate all people from the tyranny of socially constructed gender roles so i can look that kind of criticism in the face and say i feel sorry for you or more often cool story bro then there are the people on the broad left who feel its their job to police progressive action within feminism or as my grandfather mightve said those who are inside the tent pissing everywhere youre doing it wrong feminist events shouldnt have male speakers feminist events need more male speakers slutwalk is the handmaiden of capitalist oppression that will eventually lead to all women becoming prostitutes slutwalk should be called perpwalkprudewalkantivictimblamingwalk youre too middle class youre too radical why do you hate menwomen so much these are difficult viewpoints to engage with because theyre totalising arguments that are not really meant to start constructive discussions theyre intended to shut down debate not initiate it thats the very definition of trolling but i still respond to these because its part of my job to change peoples minds particularly about victimblaming of women and sexual violence and then there are the vitriolic personal attacks ranging from accusations of stupidity and unchecked privilege through to insinuations that feminists invented rape culture in order to professionally profit from it the slamming of individuals deemed incorrect seems to be a fashionable form of undermining feminism writ large i find this harder to tolerate not because women shouldnt criticise the work of other women they absolutely should and i do it frequently but mounting strenuous critiques of prevailing attitudes in the public sphere is possible without petty namecalling and spiteful innuendo not only is it inane but its the mark of a mediocre intellect and a boring writer its also doing the work of patriarchy and nobody is happier to see it than antifeminist gatekeepers of the status quo the good news is it actually doesnt matter what armchair commentators say about your feminism its up to you to learn listen say sorry when you get it wrong and grow into your values you dont have to engage when a critics signature strategy is abuse its thinly veiled insecurity that drives this tactic you dont owe anyone an explanation for your deepest held beliefs and how you live them unless you want to offer it your feminism neednt be immune to new ideas that will challenge and strengthen it but crucially its yours its yours to work on and work through and it takes energy and thought every day it may thrive if you harness your energies alongside other likeminded people and organise collectively but it will still be valuable if you perform it by having mindchanging conversations at your kitchen table back fence church or union meeting the critical mass of feminist thinking is built day by day conversation by conversation and this is what will eventually transform gender roles the hard work of feminism is being done by ordinary people who are changing the minds of their family members students or colleagues with reasoned explanations sincere engagement and respect genuine and lasting social change doesnt happen because elitist commentators get their jollies over who can craft the cleverest insult all social movements rely on everyone involved making the contribution that they can whether its marching teaching drafting legislation letting off steam on twitter or chaining yourself to a fence because in my experience youre damned if you do and youre damned if you dont so you may as well trust yourself and keep going or as ru paul says folks gon talk sht about u anyway so u might as well just do your own thang,2013-06,professional feminist much father stated disappointment make living feminist commentary advocacy write article organise march host talkshow

parents working in the public sector will take the biggest hit to their household incomes from government cuts and stagnant wages according to trades union congress research published ahead of george osbornes spending review this week the tuc says its findings undermine government attempts throughout the austerity drive to pit private sector workers against allegedly wellpaid public sector workers its calculations also suggest that more than children with a parent working in the public sector will be pushed into poverty by proportionately a far bigger rise than for the private sector if the chancellor uses wednesdays spending review to bring in further changes to public sector pay as widely feared that number risks being higher still the government however said the tuc had failed to factor in potential behavioural changes from its work pays reforms the tuc looked at government tax and benefit changes compared to the system inherited from the previous government as well as private sector wage changes based on office for budget responsibility forecasts and the governments public sector pay policy it used a model constructed for it by landman economics the model implies that families with at least one parent in public sector work will be out of pocket by twice as much a week as those with only private sector workers tuc general secretary frances ogrady accused the government of punishing families with public sector workers with years of pay freezes and real terms pay cuts ministers like to play divide and rule by trying to pit private sector workers against allegedly wellpaid public sector workers but these figures tell a very different story she said the truth is that there are low and middle income workers in all parts of the economy and they are all are having a really tough time according to the tuc analysis families where one parent works in the public sector and another works in the private sector suffer the biggest losses from government policies their average household income will be down about a week in real terms by after taking account of the current public sector pay freeze and the combined impact of tax tax credit and benefit changes they are followed by families with parents who only work in the public sector who will lose on average a week households with only private sector employees will lose out on average by a week says the tuc its calculations suggest that by almost children will move into poverty based on the government definition of a reported family income of less than of median income for families only containing public sector workers the projected rise in child poverty is the biggest the tuc forecasts there will be more such children in poverty by bringing the number to from under the system for families with both public and private sector workers the rise is for those with only private sector workers a much bigger proportion of the population the rise in children falling into poverty is the smallest of all working households in percentage terms up to million from million for families where no one is in work the rise is also but a government spokesman said the analysis did not fully take into account the dynamic and behavioural changes that will result from its welfare and tax reforms he sought to underline help from universal credit which is designed to simplify the benefits system and ensure work pays the universal credit will make million households better off the majority of these from the bottom two fifths of the income scale and lift up to children out of poverty said the spokesman noting other moves to cut the cost of living such as increasing the taxfree personal allowance to the public sector pay deal will help protect jobs and the quality of public services while helping put the uks public finances back on track the tuc analysis follows a number of recent reports into the impact of years of tough pay deals since the start of the global downturn the institute for fiscal studies says britains workers have suffered more financial pain since than in any fiveyear period of the modern age a separate report on monday suggests employers in the uk are managing to accelerate hiring only thanks to cutting or freezing pay uk job vacancies in may stood at up on a year earlier according to the latest uk employment market report from jobs search engine adzunacouk

several times a month social workers in kent are called to the port at dover to collect a child who has turned up usually hidden in the back of a lorry to embark on a new life in britain last year they collected an eightyearold boy from vietnam hidden in a box in the back of a white transit van from time to time uk border agency staff have fished children out of the water at ramsgate usually the children are in their teens and are pulled from the undercarriages of articulated lorries or found concealed behind crates in the refrigerated compartments designed to transport fresh produce sometimes they have cut through the lorrys canvas coverings with a knife and slipped beneath them a few weeks ago a boy arrived with a broken hip caused by falling from a lorry their physical state depends on how clever or lucky they are says the kent council official responsible for unaccompanied migrant children who asked not to be named some arrive in a very poor state with broken legs and arms the majority are very very tired and dishevelled last year of these children arrived in kent aged between eight and exhausted by long journeys from some of the worlds poorest and most conflictscarred nations including from afghanistan from iran from eritrea from vietnam the younger boys and girls of all ages are immediately found foster carers almost none of the children have documents so determining their age is a complex process but those boys who seem to be a bit older or above are sent to a converted old peoples home that has been made into a hostel for unaccompanied asylum seekers this is a peculiar refuge sparsely furnished bedrooms along dimly lit corridors painted in faded s institutional colours the children remain here until their age is confirmed their health checked their asylum requests investigated and their educational needs assessed they are given a few sessions about british life and culture with a heavy focus on drugs and sexually transmitted diseases but much of the time they are left to their own devices allowed to wander into the nearby town or sit in the centres shabby common room congregating into huddles of boys with shared languages two days spent at the centre reveal the extraordinary difficulties they experienced on their journeys and the huge challenge their arrival poses for officials in kent charged with caring for children who have been sent across the world in search of a better or safer life these are some of the most vulnerable young people in britain but on the whole we are not brilliant at looking after them as a parliamentary report concluded last week around children sought asylum here last year hundreds more were detained at the border during spot checks by uk border agency staff who use carbon dioxide sensors to check whether people have been breathing in the back of lorries ukba staff cannot check every lorry many more children make their way into the country undetected making it impossible to put an accurate figure on the total number staff say those who arrive at the kent childrens home represent just the tip of the iceberg those who are stopped on the border are often treated with suspicion subjected to intensive questioning by border officials and find that there is an inappropriate culture of disbelief towards their accounts the recent parliamentary report notes kent has more of these children than any other authority in britain because it is where so many of the big ports are located and the county is under pressure to improve the care they are given support workers are on hand from am to pm trying to help them adjust to their new environment they have been on the road for such a long time getting into all sorts of difficulties with people that there is a sense of relief at having a roof over their heads a place that is warm and safe the kent official says but they quickly move on to the next worry what is going to happen to me now the relief is momentary i dont see any of them jumping for joy photographs on the common room wall show images of staff trying to lift the childrens spirits making snowmen in the yard a novelty for some of the children who have never seen snow before and playing football but the atmosphere remains subdued until their english improves and unless they share a first language they are restricted to halting conversations along the lines of man united good yes in the communal dining area most eat in silence on the days i visit many of the children have been trafficked willingly or less so others may have been enticed from orphanages particularly in vietnam with promises of a better life a large proportion subsequently go missing returning to their traffickers who come to collect them or arrange to meet them in the nearby town the hostel staff do not have the right to lock up the children and nor are they always able to remove mobile phones so they find it hard to prevent children leaving if they want to last year went missing from either foster care or the home one by one a handful of boys describe their journey here sitting awkwardly in one of the homes conference rooms each talking with the assistance of an interpreter they recount confused stories of travelling through countries and cultures unfamiliar to them taking extraordinary risks with such frequency that they become unremarkable an iranian boy mohammed who like everyone interviewed here asked that his real name should not be printed and who says he is describes how his uncle paid for him to be taken from iran after his brother was arrested he doesnt know how much his uncle paid nor precisely what route he took although the interpreter says it usually goes through turkey and greece taking more than three months with day breaks from time to time staying in houses along the way and surviving mainly on biscuits at calais mohammed was grouped with about eight other young people and hidden in a lorry late at night the traffickers used ladders to get us in through the roof the driver didnt know we were in there they were transporting fruit and drink he says they were put in the fridge compartment of the articulated truck we didnt speak in the lorry the agent told us not to speak to each other the truck was too cold even though we were wearing winter clothes i had gloves and a hat but the fridge freezer was on i wanted to get out mohammed looks as if he hasnt yet begun to shave and fiddles with a key looped around his finger as he talks there is a wobbly vulnerability around his mouth as he describes his journey after a while the cold made him disoriented i didnt understand where i was i was dizzy and didnt understand what i was doing when the lorry came to a stop somewhere outside dover they climbed back out of a vent in the roof and began walking along the road until they were spotted and arrested i had no idea about england i didnt even know that i had arrived in this country i had to ask the policemen where i was he hasnt yet called his mother to tell her he has arrived safely our telephone is monitored i am afraid of calling her i dont want to do it let me see what happens staff have laminated maps of the world that they show the children to help establish where they have come from and where they are often they have not heard of england or britain but know the name london some like mohammed are reasonably welleducated if he is allowed to stay in britain he hopes to study further and wants to become a science teacher others come from refugee camps where they have had very little schooling or have spent their childhood working as goatherds in rural parts of afghanistan and iraq osman left eritrea after his father was arrested he was also helped by an uncle who took him by plane to france and directed him to the jungle in calais the migrant camp where people wait as they make repeated attempts to stow away on trucks to britain sometimes you get into a lorry at am and stay until am then the driver will hear noises and tell us to get out i tried many times to get on a lorry he says in the jerky stilted narrative of translation dotted with pauses as he confers with the interpreter in tigrinya there are people who can help you to open a fridge we went in a fridge there were five of us in there there was no space in that lorry we were all standing there was no way we could sit down i dont know what was in the cartons maybe apples the motor from the fridge was above our heads it was so dark you could not see anything the fridge came on with the motor of the car i was frightened i was afraid i might die it was the most terrifying experience of my life staff are always astonished at the number of young people who travel in lorry freezers they bang on the doors if they cant cope with the temperatures a senior social worker says the vast majority of lorry drivers are not aware they become aware only when they hear the banging on the doors and they can hear that only if the engine is switched off the children are putting themselves into real danger they know that but theyre desperate ukba officials opened up the lorry in a spot check at the port and the five people were taken out osman was dispatched to the childrens home because he was under my uncle told me this would be a safer country he says a second mohammed who is or from algeria describes how he clung to the bottom of a lorry as it drove from the lorry park near calais i hid between two wheels underneath he says you sit underneath the lorry you stretch out and you hold on with two hands you need to hold on like that for minutes once the engine starts then you hold on only for as long as it takes to get the lorry on to the train or boat he describes another spot where it is possible to hide on most lorries a tiny platform above the wheel arch where the spare tyre is you get backache you cant move once you are in position they do sometimes check but they cant see you he is surprised at my ignorance about hiding places on trucks says all people know this and laughs he was caught when the lorry left the boat the police came and shone a torch at us they searched me asked where i was from i was really scared they would return me instead they sent him to the home where he is waiting until his case is decided now i am here i have nowhere to go he says i dont feel young since i left home this journey the difficulty of sleeping rough cold snow i dont feel welcome here i havent spoken to anyone i just have that feeling i dont know people i dont speak english he looks as if he knows how to look after himself but has unhappy troubled eyes he is worried about his future what shall i tell you it is on and off sometimes i feel ok sometimes i dont thomas from eritrea travelled to france via yemen a trafficking agent packed him into a metal box used as a store for tools underneath a lorry the agent took out everything that was inside the box got rid of it all and put me inside he says i was locked inside this box with no air inside i started to suffocate could not breathe so i knocked on the door and knocked until the driver came by that time he was in britain and was arrested by the police sometimes it is clear that the children are very young an american social worker recently collected an afghan boy she believes is around from dover he was extremely tired he fell asleep as soon as he was in my car that was quite precious she remembers a brief interview at the dock was done with a telephone interpreter with officials and the boy leaning over a phone switched to loudspeaker initially they asked only essential questions do you need to see a doctor do you have any allergies ukba guidelines make it clear that the children must be allowed to sleep eat and wash before they are questioned at length it emerged later that the boys father had been killed by the taliban and that his mother and maternal uncle had arranged for him to leave he was wearing several layers of clothes when he arrived but beneath them he was clearly malnourished he put on quite a bit of weight in the first few weeks of foster care the social worker says often the younger children are more cheerful about their experiences another social worker says he recently collected two boys picked up at the dock a yearold and a yearold both from afghanistan who had travelled here hiding behind the triangular windbreaker that sits above the drivers cabin on an articulated truck the yearold thought it was a great adventure when i spoke to the yearold he said he was very worried that the child would fall off the roof that he was going to lose him on the way over many of the children seem quite resilient initially the social worker says sometimes they are fine for the first week or so just physically exhausted the adrenaline is so high from never being able to trust anyone on the journey they only break down later letting down their guard when they understand that these carers are nice people a lot of the young people particularly the afghans have witnessed their families being killed have had difficult journeys to the uk have seen people who are too ill to travel being left by the roadside to die a doctor at the practice that looks after the childrens home residents says scabies is a common problem from sharing clothes and sleeping rough many are underweight from surviving on one meal a day i see young men with terribly painful injuries from their journey the doctor says many of these young people havent had any medical care throughout their life their uncertain asylum status makes many of them very anxious establishing the age of the young people is important because it helps determine whether they will be given leave to remain or whether they will be removed from the country social workers compile an age assessment based on conversations about their background and judgments about their emotional and cognitive development staff say they suspect that some young people would like to be classified as younger than they are because that means they are able to remain longer in the immigration system by law the home office cannot forcibly remove unders who claim asylum but the parliamentary report into the care of migrant children expresses concern that funding pressures could be incentivising local authorities to assess children either as adults or as older than would otherwise be the case because of the huge costs involved last year in kent alone m was spent caring for these children social workers consider how they interact with their peers whether they are reserved or shy whether they have shaved hundreds of times before or if they have never used a razor they look at whether children are still growing physically during the time they are at the centre dental xrays can be used some young people are very confident when they arrive can go out into the community can get their hair cut can use english currency socialise others would be very much more dependent on their peers a social worker says explaining that this may be an indication of age or simply of fluency in english the age assessment process remains fairly unscientific staff are struggling to reduce the number of children who disappear again almost immediately usually these are the children whom they suspect may have been trafficked and whose trafficking agents have arranged for them to travel separately into the country to avoid exposing the agents to unnecessary risk often they have given the children detailed instructions on how to make contact with them once they have cleared the border those children who have been trafficked tend not to claim asylum because they prefer to steer clear of the immigration system if you dont you are more under the radar there is less detailed information about you says the kent official who heads the team responsible for migrant children the problem with identifying trafficked children is that it is not always something you can immediately see we wouldnt know on day one but we might have suspicions by day four children who arrive with a mobile phone are more likely to have been trafficked how do you know if they are trafficked they will ask if they can go out how far is the town how do i go on the mobile network they will be trying to use other peoples phones the official says they may go out and return with new clothes children who are thought to be trafficking victims are put in bedrooms near the reception so their movements can be monitored though staff are not allowed to lock them up we are working with teenagers and teenagers have got legs the official says they will vote with their feet we detest it when anyone goes missing it is every social workers nightmare were working with a system where we cant lock them up thats just a fact they will go if thats their plan theyre not babies any more we do what we can to ensure national alerts are put out children from vietnam are more likely to have been trafficked for work in restaurants and cannabis farms and for sexual exploitation and will often know that their families have paid large sums of money for them to be brought to the uk to work often they disappear within hours before staff have had a chance to alert the police that they are possible victims of trafficking they or someone in their family is in a lot of debt there is more fear about how they are going to pay off those debts the male social worker says the trafficker will know their families back home and has a very very powerful hold over them while we can support the young people here we cant support their families back home occasionally the young people will leave thank you notes apologising for leaving a recent note from one vietnamese boy told staff i dont want

recently i watched a policeman and several onlookers stand by as a man dragged a weeping shoeless woman along the street by her hair central beijing is generally very safe but not it seems if your assailant is your husband repeated requests that a policeman help her were ignored only after i tried to restrain the man myself and another passerby assisted did the officer take action the couple were eventually driven away to the nearest police station i have been unable to find out what happened to the woman but it is highly likely they returned home together victims usually drop charges thats not surprising since previous domestic abuse cases suggest that the police response to such cases is woefully inadequate id be shocked if a british policeman simply stood by as his counterpart did in beijing but this is not about blaming the chinese officer domestic violence is not a china problem it is a global disease and it is not just a matter for law enforcement but for all of us the sense of powerlessness and fury flooded back this week as i realised that while people watched and photographed and profited from a tearful woman in london no one did a damn thing to protect her from assault there can be good reasons for pausing in beijing i feared that i might make the man angrier and hoped that the policeman would take charge and though some victims think onlookers should step in others disagree if anyone had intervened it would have made it a million times worse at the end of the night i had to go home to that man i had children in the house a victim of abuse told victoria derbyshire in a powerful interview this week but she went on to urge witnesses to call the police pointing out how much more skilled officers have become in handling domestic violence that message is echoed by polly neate chief executive of womens aid who advised against personally stepping in but stressed it is really important that people do something yes there are still horrific shortcomings in the handling of domestic violence recently we read of the repeated pleas for help that preceded maria stubbings murder by her violent expartner the latest of too many such cases and welfare cuts are endangering womens refuges which might save other lives but police have made huge progress in tackling the issue and that gives britons the luxury of choice unlike those who witness abuse in many other parts of the world i will never know if my decision to intervene was the right one in the uk i doubt i would have had to make that judgment when we see a wrong and say nothing from embarrassment uncertainty or indifference our silence speaks for itself we tell abusers their actions are acceptable and that they can bully injure and perhaps one day kill with impunity we tell victims they do not matter and there is no point asking for help if a frightened womans safety is not worth a phone call what are the rest of us worth,2013-06,recently watched policeman several onlooker stand man dragged

i knew nothing of charlotte ravens plan to relaunch spare rib until the announcement in the guardian in april this was the magazine that i had cofounded i was flabbergasted charlotte had not contacted me and we had not exchanged emails she also could have reached me by by phone or by post on saturday april i was in sydney on the tail end of an emergency twoweek trip i woke to a flurry of emails about the news old spare ribbers were saying that they were astounded shocked they expressed a sense of betrayal as well as of some interest and hopefulness about a revival they had strong loyalties to the magazine its heritage and the value of its name why had they and i not been contacted they asked what about permission one old spare ribber asked did charlotte think we were dead when we founded spare rib in the womens liberation movement was still very small a couple of hundred women at most we began it as the alternative news magazine for women we accompanied it with statement about the position of women back then and stating our aims the womens movement grew because it resonated with so many women around the country spare rib the magazine grew with it it became seen as the public face of the womens movement but it was a magazine it was not synonymous with the movement the web offers a different opportunity today for women and for feminism it is a marvellous opportunity but that does not alter the fact that by definition a movement is not something that you pay to join we were therefore keen to clarify with charlotte the part of her venture that she was calling the spare rib movement autonomy was a vital issue of the early womens movement and continues to be a basic tenet of feminism women taking charge of their own lives no one organising or deciding on behalf of the women involved so i had another question about charlottes proposed spare rib membership platform her website is being organised by a public company charlotte appointed this company to contact members on her behalfto be her voice to gather information for her as well as to set up the membership system at spare rib we were always concerned about our dialogue with readers if such a dialogue is filtered through a separate commercial company what does that mean for autonomy of the proposed spare rib movement how would this company understand and interpret or filter members concerns and questions how can this operate as an essential arm of the twoway communication between the members of this movement there are many women who might want to engage with charlottes website as a way of connecting with feminism today but many of these would be on parttime salaries or be unemployed or be students or even schoolgirls so this returns to the question of whether her website membership system can be regarded as a movement charlotte has jokily suggested ideas that women can forego something such as waxing in order to pay to become a member my concern is that there are many women now who cannot possibly afford waxing let alone the amount being asked as the lowest level of monthly membership fee or is it a due or a donation or a subscription i remain confused the name spare rib has an emotional and a commercial value but to us it was never a brand it became iconic because of the energy commitment and time of the many women who contributed to the magazine who worked on it tirelessly who put on fundraising concerts when we needed the cash who used it as their focus for communication and challenge and dreams for imagining how our lives could change and how this could be made a reality if this name were to be revived rosie boycott and i want to ensure that as a web magazine or in print it would not flounder at first base i told charlotte that feminism back then was a grassroots movement it was for womens liberation spare rib became an integral part of that movement by virtue of the way we interacted we were in constant dialogue with readers with activists with artists with women at work or at home who were confronting sexism and discrimination we never knew where the next idea was coming from we were changing the way we used language the way we thought the way we talked and dressed and lived that was not and cannot be wrapped up in a neat sellable commodity that experience lives on in feminism today,2013-06,knew nothing charlotte raven plan relaunch

hundreds of children who travel by themselves to britain seeking asylum every year should be better cared for by the state a parliamentary human rights committee has concluded noting that currently the state does not always have their best interests at heart the report by the joint committee on human rights jchr warns that the system designed to identify which children have been trafficked into the uk is flawed and as a result many children who have been brought here by traffickers usually to work or for sexual exploitation are not helped as a result the system is failing to prevent child victims of trafficking from endingup in the criminal justice system accused of committing a crime around unaccompanied migrant children sought asylum in the uk last year and a total of around unaccompanied migrant children were being cared for by local authorities of these were under the age of many children arrive in kent in very poor health having hidden in the back of lorries crossing on trains and ferries from france for the last stage of a long journey which has often been very traumatic not all unaccompanied migrant children are discovered or make themselves known to officials so the real total is unknown the report warns that there is an inappropriate culture of disbelief from officials who are excessively sceptical about the childrens accounts of their backgrounds journeys and their ages the committee noted that the age of these children is too often disputed putting their welfare and best interests at risk it recommends that children should more often be given the benefit of the doubt formally declaring a child to be under the age of triggers expensive responsibilities for local authorities and also means the individual is less likely to be returned to their home country immediately even if their asylum claim is rejected the report expresses concern that because they are liable for the costs of those determined to be children funding pressures could be incentivising local authorities to assess children either as adults or as older than would otherwise be the case immigration regulations were often found to take precedence over the welfare of the children the report states before reiterating that these children are entitled to protection under domestic legislation and also under the un convention on the rights of the child providing protection and support effectively is crucial the asylum and immigration process can be complex and the stress it can cause can be particularly acute for children it states the report expressed disappointment that the education of these children was not a priority and that too often there were long delays before the children were found school places we saw concerning accounts of the educational provision on offer and dissatisfaction that children were being hindered in their access to higher education by funding arrangements it calls for the creation of a better support structure for the children to help children navigate the asylum and immigration processes highlights how legal aid funding is making it harder for the children to get access to good quality legal advice and proposes experimenting with providing the children with guardians to help them have their voices heard the committee also calls on the government not to return any children to afghanistan or iraq while conflict and humanitarian concerns persist there is also an insufficient focus on welfare when making decisions about whether to return children to their country of origin or third countries the government should affirm that it will not participate in any programme that would return children to countries such as afghanistan or iraq where there are ongoing conflict or humanitarian concerns the report states hywel francis labour mp and chair of the committee said unaccompanied migrant children in the asylum and immigration processes are some of the most vulnerable young people in the united kingdom they have often fled conflict situations abroad or have been victims of abuse and exploitation including those who arrive as victims of trafficking it is crucial that they are supported effectively we do not find it satisfactory that immigration concerns are too often given priority when dealing with such children in doing so the uk is falling short of the obligations it owes to such children under the un convention on the rights of the child a home office spokesperson said the uk takes its international responsibilities to children seriously and their welfare is at the heart of every decision

the human right to a family life is recognised in domestic and international law strong and stable families are central to our society the crossparty report into the impacts of recent family migration rules however shows that hundreds of british citizens and permanent residents have been kept apart from their family members since july report june the rules now require that people wishing to bring a spouse partner or child to the uk from outside the eu earn at least a year higher than the income of almost half the uk working population many children including british children have been indefinitely separated from a parent with implications for their wellbeing and development in addition skilled professionals including nhs consultants wishing to care for an elderly relative at their own expense in the uk are now unable to do so these rules are unfair and damaging and we urge the government to reconsider them paul blomfield mp david ward mp pete wishart mp bishop patrick lynch archdiocese of southwark dr maggie atkinson childrens commissioner for england professor vivienne nathanson british medical association peter carter royal college of nursing don flynn migrants rights network shami chakrabarti liberty jasvir singh city sikhs network we are stunned by the ministry of justices proposal that abused and neglected children must in future satisfy a oneyear residency test or else be legally unrepresented in their own care proceedings our family justice system is founded on the principle that the child must be independently represented in child protection proceedings since the death of maria colwell in it has been recognised that the childs welfare can too easily come second to the needs of parents or councils there are children in care hundreds currently in care proceedings would not be able to satisfy the new test because they have arrived here too recently or because their carers relationship to the child or immigration status is in question victoria climbi would not have qualified under the new test she was brought to london in april by marietherese kouao who falsely claimed to be her mother victoria was starved neglected and tortured by kouao and her partner carl manning until she finally died in february aged eight the laming inquiry into her death found terrible failures by four local authorities as well as by the nhs if just one of those agencies had taken protective action victoria would have been removed from kouao and care proceedings would have been initiated with victoria represented by a specialist solicitor who was a member of the law societys children panel if the residency requirement for children is introduced another victoria climbi would not be entitled to legal aid as they would be here unlawfully maud davis nicola jonesking martha cover association of lawyers for children the requirement under the proposed legal aid changes to be here for months will automatically exclude all children who are under one year old as of course they cannot have been anywhere for months this will cover all uk citizens children that will mean that no baby will be represented in care proceedings or in any other family or clinical negligence case until they are at least one year old even if the child or adult can show that they have been here months they still have to prove they are british citizens the government is proposing that solicitors will have to have proof on their file before they can apply for legal aid many uk citizens may struggle to prove this if they live on the margins and do not have any documents to prove who they are it will affect women fleeing from domestic violence who have left their paperwork behind it will affect children of all ages where there simply may be no paperwork at all or it is in the

im sure we all remember the day that we left home the mix of excitement and apprehension at striking out in the adult world alone except that the majority of people reading this werent really alone how many times did you call up your mum or dad or gran when things got tough how many hot dinners and hugs did they give you long after youd moved out of the family home indeed a barnardos survey found that only of uk parents expected their children to leave home by with more than a quarter expecting them to be in their mids before they fly the nest for those young people who have grown up in the care of the state leaving their foster home is just as pivotal a moment through no fault of their own there are more than children in the governments care today they will have experienced a great deal already in their young lives some of them will have been abused some neglected and even after they have turned they are likely to need someone to turn to the government is currently addressing the support it provides for vulnerable children in its children and families bill but there is nothing in there about children leaving care these young people are among the most vulnerable in our society and this is a prime opportunity to do the right thing by those to whom the state has a moral obligation it shouldnt be wasted as someone who grew up in the care system i know the difference it makes having someone who believes in you when youre starting out in the world after i was entrusted to barnardos care i was raised for years in a foster home with other children and a woman i came to know as mum crucially once i left care i was given support by barnardos not once but twice firstly as a student towards a course at st martins college of art and then later i was granted a loan to start my own business it was this and my determination that helped me become the fashion designer i am today i believe that it is a tragedy when young peoples lives are thwarted by an abysmally low expectation of what they can achieve that is why the government needs to make sure all children leaving care have someone to turn to until they are barnardos estimates that providing this safety net to care leavers would cost about a year for each young person leaving care when you consider that even over seven years thats less expensive than the tuition fees for a degree at many of the uks universities it seems a negligible amount to make sure these young people start adult life on the right path furthermore when you consider that around a quarter of both the adult prison population and those living on the street have spent time in care making sure that these young people have someone to turn to before times get too tough is an investment that will ultimately make savings for us all in the future its time to be every bit as ambitious for these young people as we would be for our own children and help make their dreams come true,2013-06,im sure remember day left home mix excitement apprehension striking adult world alone except majority people reading werent really alone many time call mum dad gran thing got tough many hot dinner hug give long youd moved family home

a crossparty group of mps has called for an urgent review of new immigration rules which they claim are tearing hundreds of british families apart their inquiry report shows that a new minimum earnings rule of a year which came into effect last july has meant that thousands of british citizens including people with fulltime jobs have been unable to bring a noneuropean husband wife or partner to live with them in britain a dossier drawn from submissions by individual families affected by the rule includes the case of an australian who works as a ayear chief financial officer of a multinational company in dubai and has a m property in britain he is not eligible to live with his british wife and children in the uk under the new rule because she is not employed and his overseas earnings do not count the dossier also includes examples of elderly couples who are being denied the chance to retire in britain or face separation because their earnings fall short of the threshold the threshold rises to if the couple have a child and rises by for every extra child the inquiry report by the allparty parliamentary group on migration published on monday says the requirement that only the earnings of the uk sponsor can usually be counted has meant that highearning individuals and families with significant resources have been prevented from living in britain the mps say the income threshold has also led to many young children being separated from one of their parents including a breastfeeding mother who was separated from her baby the former liberal democrat childrens minister sarah teather said the new rules on family migration showed that the government was far from meeting its pledge to support family life in britain during the course of the inquiry we heard from many families in which british children are being made to grow up away from a parent or where families had been forced to move overseas in order to be together whatever the objective of the policy children shouldnt suffer as a result now is the time to take another look at the policy liberal democrat home affairs spokeswoman baroness sally hamwee who chaired the inquiry said it had also shown that a previous route under which elderly relatives including grandparents were cared for in britain by their families had now all but closed the report shows that one elderly dependent relative visa was granted between july and october last year the restrictions on family migration were introduced by home office ministers as part of the drive to reduce net migration to britain down to the tens of thousands a home office spokesperson said the family rules had been designed to make sure that those coming to the uk to join their spouse or partner would not become a burden on the taxpayer and would be well enough supported to integrate effectively highvalue migrants would not be refused because their british spouse or partner was not employed they can meet the income threshold by having cash savings of or through their own private income for example from investments we have also introduced greater flexibility for those holding investments to liquidate them into cash in order to meet the rules they said a home office impact assessment estimated that up to fewer family visas from outside the european economic area would be issued each year as a result of the income threshold rule examples given to the inquiry of families being split apart by the new rules include rachel i am a british citizen and my partner is albanian im not able to sponsor him as i am still studying and not earning over our baby is now two months old but his father has only seen him via skype hannah currently im a month short of the financial requirement i served in the british army for

the governments new social mobility tsar james caan was accused of hypocrisy last week when the former dragons den star said parents should leave their children to make their own way in life only for it to emerge that he employs one of his daughters and the other works for a recruitment firm he partowns caans later protestation that parents instinctively protect and promote the interests of their children resonated widely but how much help should parents give their children does intervention help or hinder helping a fouryearold learn to read is universally accepted as a good thing though some feel it is going too far to write or edit a teenagers personal statement on their university application form and with youth unemployment at leaving to yearolds out of work many rely on the bank of mum and dad while they take unpaid work experience or internships primary schools generally welcome parental involvement but secondary schools view it with suspicion some insist that coursework that contributes to an exam be done in school to prevent parents doing it there are as many theories as to whether extra help assists a childs development as there are tips on parenting but a recent study found that undergraduates with a history of parental overinvolvement had higher levels of depression and anxiety the research by holly schiffrin of the university of mary washington in virginia found that these students felt incompetent compared with their peers and less able to manage life and its stresses but many parents whether of preschool children adolescents or young adults find that conclusion unpalatable the observer spoke to five parents about the help they give their children there is nothing shameful about giving your child a legup anne heald is an accountant and lives in bristol with her husband edwin also a civil servant their son philip moved back home last week after finishing a degree in international politics and military history at aberystwyth university anne said hell would freeze over before i stopped trying to open doors for my son i would do anything in my power to get his feet on the employment ladder not only have both parents been actively involved during his school and university days and found him workexperience placements but they are now altering their home to give him his own place to live and financing his job hunt philip is at home now we are going to try to separate our lives so he lives in the basement to ease the passage into coming back hes been away for three years and it would be hard for him to come back into our home as if he never left hes coming back to live at the bank of mum and dad the reason he returned home is he is having a tough time finding a graduate job hed work at anything i think as he has no idea what specific field he wants to go into he gets good career advice from his university on how to write covering letters and his cv but that isnt enough to get him a job hes not tied to bristol because his parents live here he would move anywhere in the world hes only living here because it doesnt cost him any money hes trying to get any job possible at the moment but it is still in its infancy anne said that while the job hunt is not going very well for philip she is confident he has and has always had the support from his family necessary to help him find his feet in life she said we are encouraging him to do his own washing and cleaning he will be living with us but not be with us all the time i dont even plan for us to eat together every night of course ill cook him dinner if he asks me to though i dont want him to be tied to my apron strings but i do love having him home the important thing for philip is getting a graduate job in a good company if it was in outer mongolia i would support that anne has helped her only child get vital work experience she said i can be quite ruthless promoting my son wherever i can last summer he got a work placement with wells mp tessa munt and because i know a canon at westminster abbey i made sure philip got in touch with him i also made sure our local mp stephen williams knew that philip was on a placement if there were any opportunities for philip through my working experience and contacts i will try to put him in touch with the people that might help him i draw from my life skills and experience to make my son more aware of the adult working environment hes trying to step into financially we will support him wherever necessary as long as he is trying to stand on his own two feet we will buy him his first car when needed theres nothing shameful or wrong about giving your child a legup in life no matter how old they are ill still be helping philip if i think he needs it until the day i die i picked a school the highfliers go to katharine tustian from blindley heath surrey works with preschool children and does not believe she is bright enough to help her daughter alice with schoolwork but she did go to considerable lengths to find the state secondary school that would give her the best start in life im not welleducated and dont have a high level of intelligence but i know people who do said katharine i knew children who were likely to prosper because their parents were in highpowered jobs so i found out where they went i have sent her to a school where parents have high expectations of their children i know doing afterschool activities is a benefit to your childs wellbeing so i encourage that alice does gym club cheerleading and air cadets helping with homework no because to be honest i cant do it had alice struggled with maths she might have hired a tutor i think she is going to get through on her own merit without me pushing i shall just do the encouraging we expect that she will go to university but i dont sit there and do the work for her i did read to her every day until she was nine however id give him a shove in the right direction single mother nicola taylor lives in preston lancashire where she works for a security company her son george is she has always devoted as much time as she can throughout his school career to helping him i would do anything i could to help george hes the most important person in the world to me said nicola george knows i dont have a lot of money but i do whatever i can do to help him i have been saving for two years so finances would not be a problem if he decided to go to university she said she has always been on hand to help with his schoolwork and if he needs her help in future to get a job she will do whatever she can if he wanted to go into the security industry i would speak to any one of my contacts necessary to get his foot in the door but i would never dream of just giving him a job instead ill introduce him to anyone i think could help him and if need be id give him a little shove in the right direction ill help but i wont do her homework for her jon mills is an office manager from bristol he and his wife ruth have a fiveyearold daughter jane he said i help jane all the time with her homework and times tables but i would never do her homework for her thats not how i want to raise my child we try to involve teaching and learning in everything we do with jane its not just about homework its about talking about numbers and words whenever they come up ill always help her when she goes to secondary school and through to university if she wants but ill never just do her work for her what i try to do is help give her the tools to understand things rather than giving her the answers i try and show her how to find the answer for herself and that wont change as she gets older it will make her a stronger person more able to make decisions for herself i would be honoured if she chose to do the same career as me and i would help her in any way i can but before i let her make any decisions that would dictate her career for years to come she would have to be sure that she was making the decision with her eyes open using your contacts could be the only way reverend glyn evanss daughter abbie is studying biology at sheffield university and he says he would always look to give her fair opportunities the yearold vicar from newcastleupontyne said it is just about giving opportunities to everybody isnt it my experience has been that most kids dont want a handup what parents are trying to seek for their children is a fair playing field with people they are competing against you have to give them a fair crack of the whip its a difficult balance glyn added my dad helped me get contacts in school when i was trying to become a teacher and i dont think that was wrong people in the police force have been sacked for doing that kind of thing while people in businesses seem to do it a lot i think if business these days is such a competitive industry sometimes using your contacts is the only way for your kids to find work it is one thing giving them an opportunity that they grow into success but it is another just handing it to them on a plate i dont necessarily think it is right or wrong its about giving your children a fair

the number of young people in care in england is dwarfed by the who it is estimated are being raised by an unrecognised army of grandparents siblings and aunts many have had to fight to prevent a child being fostered with strangers or put up for adoption and once they are successful they very often receive little support with the children they willingly take on some of whom may be damaged by their experiences relatives postpone qualifications for fruitful careers give up jobs and abandon plans for active retirements to become fulltime carers often struggling on pensions to raise toddlers the sacrifices they make and the valuable work conducted by lawyers campaigners volunteers researchers and social workers involved in kinship care are paid too little attention so we very much welcome

at and three quarters lookedafter children get their leaving care worker and then they start talking about how youll get this wonderful flat and to furnish it says foster carer glynis wall they took kim to see hostels but at she was just not streetwise and couldnt have coped wall had fostered kim huang now since she arrived in the uk as an unaccompanied yearold vietnamese asylum seeker the girls parents had both died before she left vietnam and she had no family or support structure in the world apart from hall and her daughter with whom kim had grown up nevertheless as she approached her th birthday and was studying for her gcses huang was told that manchester social services were no longer willing to fund her foster placement they wanted her to live independently i was still so young and i couldnt understand why they couldnt support us says huang if i was living alone id have been out on the street on my own i found it stressful and quite scary wall had to go to appeal and quote legislation to them she remembers we got them to agree to fund her until she was but they made it quite clear there would be no foster placement allowances after that and there werent according to the fostering network the average age at which most young people leave home in the uk is but for lookedafter children local authority care usually comes to an abrupt halt on their th birthday with many councils progressively sloughing off responsibility in the two years that precede it what happens to that young person next is down to the luck of the draw some councils do offer funding so that they can stay with foster carers others rely on their foster carer giving them a home for free but many more have to move out to live on their own in support of the fostering networks dont move me campaign which aims to give all young care leavers the chance to remain in their foster home paul goggins mp has tabled an amendment to the children and families bill that would require that care be funded by central government directed through local authorities until the age of the amendment will be considered in parliament on tuesday but only if it is selected by the speaker for debate to date mps from all parties have recorded video messages in support of the campaign highlighting their own experiences of leaving home and addressing the issue of inadequate support for care leavers goggins said there is a moral imperative to protect young people who by definition of their care status will already have undergone profoundly destructive experiences and will be susceptible to developing chaotic lifestyles if left unsupported as they enter adulthood it seems to me so wrong that just one in young people who have found some stability in a foster placement are able to stay there when they reach he said a lot of effort goes into looking after these children but having invested all that time and money and care theyre forced to exit the system too soon and we all know the difficulties that can result from that eric mole an experienced foster carer based in cheshire points out that a typical response to their uncertain future is for teenagers to run away often repeatedly in an attempt to exert some control over their lives the recent oxford gang grooming trial and before that the one in rochdale demonstrates all too clearly some of the dangers for children in care of repeated running away its such an easy concept says vicki swain campaigns manager at the fostering network why would you not support a young person in care as you would your own child cost might seem the obvious if brutal answer but perhaps surprisingly it turns out that such a scheme wouldnt be particularly expensive a department for education pilot called staying put which funded local authorities between and to continue paying an allowance to foster carers of young people who chose to stay on after was evaluated by the centre for child and family research at loughborough university the annual national cost worked out at loughboroughs evaluation found the average proportion of young people staying put across the pilot authorities was just under this is in line with figures for a similar scheme in northern ireland where nearly of young people are in going the extra mile schemes the modest cost just per local authority per year is explained by the fact that not every young person stays on longterm after their th birthday two years ago faced with her local authoritys intransigence wall told her foster daughter she would always have a place in her home but that had serious consequences id fostered since its been my lifes work and ive only got a twoup twodown terrace so if kim was to stay i had to stop fostering she said im a single carer with no husbands wage to fall back on your fostering allowance is your wage it meant i had to go on jobseekers allowance and try to find a job but i knew that if they could treat young people like this i didnt want anything to do with it huang was fortunate she was able to spend the year after her th birthday living with wall while she finished her alevels then went to university secure in the knowledge that she had a place to call home she is one of the success stories just of care leavers go on to higher education zoe witherington who has been fostered for six years in colchester says the situation is distressing and very destabilising she was in the middle of her alevels in the runup to her th birthday last november when her local authority newham in east london told her it would no longer support her essex foster place she was advised that she would have to leave her college go back to london and live on income support after pleas by witherington her foster parents and her tutors it was agreed that she could remain in her home though her foster parents are paid at a much reduced rate until she finishes alevels once she goes to university there will be no more support but unless gogginss amendment is accepted a good proportion of the young people who leave care annually will never enjoy that sense of a secure base as they face the challenges of early adulthood instead they will have to cope with the anxiety

the big falls in child and pensioner poverty under tony blair and gordon brown are under threat as a harsher economic climate results in a paring back of the financial help that raised living standards between and the uks leading tax and spending experts have said a report on thursday by the institute for fiscal studies said labours legacy during its three terms in office was fragile because success in lifting individuals above the poverty threshold relied heavily on generous welfare benefits on the day the opposition leader ed miliband said he would impose a cap on welfare spending the ifs said the last labour government had cut child and pensioner poverty but had been unable to prevent a widening of income inequality at the end of the s blair pledged to eradicate child poverty within a generation and set an interim target of halving the number of children living below the official breadline by the ifs said both absolute and relative measures of income poverty fell markedly among children and pensioners although the scale of the changes did not always match the considerable ambition as set out explicitly in the case of the governments child poverty targets the report noted that the extra money provided by blair and brown was vital in bringing down poverty rates with an bn annual increase in spending on benefits for families with children and an bn annual increase in benefits for pensioners between and our modelling suggests child and pensioner poverty would either have stayed the same or risen rather than fall substantially had there not been these big spending increases it added the fiscal climate is now very different and welfare spending can be cut back just as quickly as it is increased as most of the currently detectable effects of labour policy on poverty rates came through benefit increases labours legacy may prove fragile its durability will thus depend crucially on whether wider policies on things like education and childcare do have longrun impacts when labour came to power in of children lived in households whose income was less than of the national median by the time of the general election the proportion had fallen to with pensioner poverty at a similar level by contrast the incomes of poorer workingage adults without dependent children the major demographic group not emphasised by labour as a priority changed very little over the period as a result they fell behind the rest of the population and relative poverty levels rose since childless workingage people started the period with low levels of poverty compared with other demographic groups one consequence of these trends was that the risks of poverty across the major demographic groups converged under labour the ifs said there were also increases in employment which had a small but detectable effect on income poverty for example reductions in the proportion of children living in workless families acted to reduce relative child poverty by about two percentage points it added that big falls in poverty among children and pensioners had not translated into a decline in inequality which had risen most sharply during the s owing to substantial increases in pay for those in the top income group,2013-06,big fall child pensioner poverty tony blair gordon brown threat harsher economic climate result paring back financial help raised living

coalition relations will reach a new low on thursday when nick clegg announces that he is to kill off plans to relax childtostaff ratios for childcare in england clegg said he had decided to block the plans by the conservative childrens minister liz truss because an extensive consultation had shown that her two key aims would fail relaxing childtostaff ratios would not necessarily drive down the costs of childcare and might even increase them and would not necessarily improve standards he said in a sign of how coalition policymaking has descended into handtohand combat between the tories and the liberal democrats downing street appeared to be caught off guard by the clegg announcement a no source said the governments planned childcare policy had not yet been agreed and would be announced shortly it is a bit premature to brief before the final package has been agreed one senior tory source said of the clegg move it is not really the way to behave the deputy prime minister who briefed childcare providers on wednesday that he had killed off the truss blueprint remained unbowed and issued a statement saying that her plans failed to stack up clegg said i cannot ask parents to accept such a controversial change with no real guarantee it will save them money in fact it could cost them more the intervention by clegg who spoke to david cameron on monday about childcare was seen in no as one of his most hostile acts since he killed off tory plans last summer to shrink the size of the commons after tory mps sank his plans to reform the house of lords truss proposed to allow childminders to increase the number of underones they can look after from three to four this would increase from four to six for children over the age of two the rules for threeyearolds would remain the same eight or children per adult depending on whether a graduate was present but clegg said trusss calculations were flawed because they were based on unrealistic occupancy and opening times that childcare operators would fill of their places and be full all year round he also pointed out that most of the savings identified by truss were based on providers using current freedoms which are mainly unused at the moment downing street hit back at clegg a no source said the prime minister remains committed to helping families with the cost of living which includes reducing the cost of childcare the final package of childcare measures which will seek to reduce childcare costs and make it easier to set up childcare in schools has not yet been agreed but will be announced shortly the latest move by the deputy prime minister was also being seen as revenge after downing street responded to the weekend parliamentary sleaze allegations by announcing that cleggs plans to reform lobbyists would involve new restrictions on trade union fundingin a breach of ministerial collective responsibility clegg released a briefing note that endorsed a quote from the preschool learning alliance which accused the education department of cynicism and of producing a work of fiction clegg said the proposals to increase ratios were put out to consultation and were roundly criticised by parents providers and experts alike most importantly there is no real evidence that increasing ratios will reduce the cost of childcare for families the argument that this will help families with their weekly childcare bill simply does not stack up i cannot ask parents to accept such a controversial change with no real guarantee it will save them money in fact it could cost them more lib dem sources denied that clegg was embarking on a titfortat revenge amid worsening coalition relations they said that the deputy prime minister who regards child care as one of the coalitions main priorities simply believes the truss plan will fail to achieve its stated goals truss proposed to allow child minders to increase the number of underones they can look after from three to four this would increase from four to six for children over the age of two the rules for threeyearolds would remain the same eight or children per adult depending on whether a graduate was present clegg said trusss calculations were flawed because they were based on unrealistic occupancy and opening times that child care operators would fill of their places and be full all year round he also pointed out that most of the savings identified by truss were based on providers using current freedoms which are mainly unused at the moment the deputy prime minister who was furious with truss for publicising their private disagreement also sanctioned a rare briefing on their internal discussions his office published emails with trusss private secretary who agreed that the final policy would be agreed by the cabinets home affairs committee chaired by clegg after the consultation truss had accused clegg of reneging on an agreement to accept her policy lib dem sources said that when clegg asked truss to have a rethink last month she simply wrote a letter to all the relevant ministers reiterating her plans neil leitch chief executive of the preschool learning alliance whose criticisms of truss were cited by clegg said we are absolutely delighted that the deputy prime minister has intervened and listened to the concerns and evidence gathered by the sector parents and early years experts which dismantled the arguments for taking forward this illadvised plan justine roberts chief executive of the mumsnet website who had called for a rethink said mumsnet users will be mightily relieved to hear that the proposed changes to childcare ratios are to be scrapped parents were unconvinced that the suggested changes would lead to lower childcare costs but did believe that the quality of care would be adversely affected put simply four babies under one or six under twos is a lot for even the most experienced childcare worker to manage coalition tensions will be worsened on another front today when tory sources make clear they will ensure that local communities will effectively be able to block new onshore windfarms ed davey the lib dem climate change secretary will say that a new package of measures will offer incentives to local communities to encourage them to accept wind farms but the tories are making clear that new planning rules will give communities greater clout in

britain faces a colossal bill for child poverty with the cost of increasing rates of destitution calculated to reach bn a year by according to a report donald hirsch an academic at loughborough university says that oneinfour children in britain million is forecast to be in relative poverty by the end of the decade at those levels about of the countrys gdp would be consumed as well as the longer term losses to the economy that result from lower educational attainment and poorer physical and mental health in later life the result is a bill in of bn an amount that exceeds the cost of hs the proposed highspeed rail network hirsch first calculated the cost to the country of very high levels of child poverty in and warned then that the economy was losing bn a year because of impoverished childhoods today child poverty rates are back up to levels with cuts to public services balanced by increases in spending via the pupil premium and new nursery places for poor families there has been a rise in the cost of child poverty to the country taking the bill to bn in his report hirsch says that bn of this is for spending on services to deal with the consequences of child poverty while bn is the loss in private posttax earnings by adults who having grown up in poverty charities are concerned that the chancellor will use this months spending review to cut working age benefits under his plans to limit the governments annually managed expenditure and want to highlight that such a move would simply store up costs for the future such is the political potency of the coalitions move that on thursday labours ed miliband will lay out plans for his partys version of a cap on such managed expenditure which includes pensions benefits and tax credits alison garnham chief executive of the charity child poverty action group which commissioned the research said this research shows that policies which increase child poverty are a false economy costing the country as well as poor children themselves dear in the last three years families with children have had to bear the brunt of the governments austerity programme it is no surprise that child poverty is projected to increase as a result the spending review later this month is an opportunity to change course and prioritise families with children once again a child is considered to be in relative poverty if he or she lives in a household whose income is below of the average in that year the report uses figures from the institute for fiscal studies to show that child poverty will rise by between and in effect reversing all of the reductions that took place under labour between and the prospect of facing this colossal bill for allowing child poverty to return to around its high point last seen in the late s is a powerful incentive to devote resources instead to fulfilling the commitment of its eradication said hirsch labours welfare spokesman liam byrne said this report shows that the price of ministers failure on child poverty isnt just a million more children growing up poor its a gigantic bn bill for the tax payer its not just a moral failure but an economic disaster ministers should be doing everything they can for struggling families but instead they are slashing working families tax credits whilst handing a massive tax cut to the richest people in the country that tells you all you need to know about this governments priorities not only is there a cost attached to rising levels of child poverty but the trend is illegal left unabated child poverty will reach in compared with the goal of written in law iain duncan smith the welfare and pensions secretary has publicly questioned whether poverty targets are useful arguing that feckless parents only spend money on themselves nick pearce of the leftleaning institute for public policy research has also called for another way to tackle child poverty and called for the targets to be dropped a dwp spokesperson said despite paying out bn in benefits and tax credits over the last decade the previous government failed to meet their target to halve child poverty by and far too many children were left behind this government remains committed to eradicating child poverty but we want to take a new approach by tackling the root causes including worklessness educational failure and family breakdown our welfare reforms will

last week the australian reported that the countrys four major banks are strong opponents of the coalitions paid parental leave scheme theyre among the countrys biggest companies and should tony abbott be elected prime minister they will be paying a levy to fund the scheme the policy like no other in the federal space is dividing supporters and opponents along peculiar lines the big end of town together with many in the coalition are putting pressure on abbott to drop the scheme on the other side the labor party is in the awkward position of opposing a scheme that would introduce a more generous entitlement for working women the labor government introduced the countrys first universal paid parental leave scheme back in and now provides paid leave for up to weeks at minimum wage i had my first child in several years before the scheme was introduced but i was lucky enough to receive paid maternity leave back then mothers like me with high salaries and secure professional jobs tended to negotiate leave with our employers in fact abs data from that time shows roughly of mothers earning per week had access to paid maternity leave while less than of mothers earning under per week enjoyed the same entitlement low income mothers were just as exhausted as me and their babies just as demanding as mine but they were missing out it was grossly unfair the introduction of a universal scheme in this country was about helping those women and their babies catch up to the rest of us for one to now argue when advocating for abbotts scheme that what is most needed by mothers is to transform the entitlement so that the greater your income the greater the amount you receive requires tricky lines just ask abbott even economics writer jessica irvine floundered but why pay wealthy women more than poorer women for performing essentially the same act of raising a child she asked high income earning women embody a lot of skills and know how that boosts not only their own economic productivity but that of their children studies show that the children of highly educated women have better income prospects themselves thats nice but the reason children with wealthier mothers perform better isnt good breeding it is because of the advantages afforded by wealth if anything this is an argument for financial assistance for children of poor families not wealthy ones women in rural areas are among those more likely to become low income parents which is why some national party members are also troubled by abbotts scheme there is also a greater good with generous paid parental leave it keeps women attached to the workforce as a nation it makes economic sense to support generous paid parental leave for everyone because it fosters growth generates tax revenue and reduces retirement welfare expenditure not only that but women who stay around long enough to reach leadership positions gain the power to make policy changes that can improve the lives of women with less advantage only if youve felt the anguish yourself of a meeting running so late that you missed the chance to see your sick baby before the nanny put him to sleep for the night do you push hard for earlier meetings and only then is it possible for the secretaries who lack the power to change things but who also attend your meetings to leave in time to see their babies resources and goodwill for parents are finite in a federal budget you muster it for one initiative at the expense of another you can then forgive women struggling in low pay jobs who think focusing on the advancement of the most advantaged women and investing in this kind of trickledown feminism is not what would most benefit their working lives what these mothers need right now is affordable high quality childcare and workplace flexibility i have little doubt that the women of calibre abbott is concerned with also desperately crave flexibility six months leave with a newborn is valuable to a senior woman in a law firm but if returning to work means nothing less than a hour work week then workplace flexibility is what you really want for the long haul for that matter if the purpose of abbotts scheme is retention of women in the workforce then its focus may be misplaced generally speaking higher education is associated with a greater chance of returning to work the most vulnerable are those with low levels of education and impermanent employment rewarding the parents most likely to return to work may reinforce inequality if motherhood is such a political issue it is a shame there isnt more competition between the two major parties with the coming election the labor governments increase to the childcare rebate the boost to family payments for teenagers and the schoolkids bonus all help

the number of childcare places available to parents in england has gone down sharply and providers have been dropping out of the industry according to ofsted figures the last six months have seen the total number of places fall by almost while a study released last week showed cuts to the sure start programme which is designed to help the most underprivileged children and families have led to a loss of community nurseries a drop of private nurseries have also shed places birth rates have been rising steadily over the past decade and opposition mps claim the drop in available places is a further indication of the deepening childcare crisis the biggest drop is in numbers of childminders with figures showing that there were fewer in march this year than in march down from to over the same period there has been a decline in the numbers of childcare providers operating down by almost the figures emerged as ministers were forced to acknowledge a study by the charities children and the daycare trust which showed that sure start centres are expected to close a further will have to provide a reduced service and will have a smaller budget staff at centres have been warned about the threat of redundancy according to the survey of almost centre managers across england the centres providing daycare are typically in the most disadvantaged areas where fewer private nurseries operatethe closures and reduced services as a result of government cuts could see families lose their local centre it is claimed a parliamentary answer from childcare minister liz truss conceded that the number of childrens centres providing full daycare fell from in to in with no figures available since then labour mp frank field the government adviser on poverty said it is inconceivable that we can make the foundation years effective if sure starts all over the place are being slaughtered local authorities must seek to employ innovative methods to ensure families especially the poorest families do not lose the vital support they need labour claims the drop in available places comes as more parents are forced to reduce their reliance on formal childcare because of rising costs and government cuts to childcare tax credits shadow childrens minister sharon hodgson said david cameron has created a childcare crisis parents are struggling to find affordable childcare because so many nurseries and childrens centres have disappeared since the election while ministers squabble over the deeply unpopular plans to increase ratios parents are being hit by a triple whammy of increasing costs cuts to government support and now places disappearing ministers need to listen to parents and come back with comprehensive plans to turn around this crisis and ensure everyone has access to

misogyny rather like the poor will always be with us dont worry i am not going to rehearse the how ok is it to threaten to rape a women online number is it quite ok a little bit ok not ok show me your workings essentially twitter has to decide whether it is a platform or a publisher responsible for its content as it is selling ads it is indisputable that it is more than a mere conduit all this has been useful in highlighting the crap thrown at women this is not to say others dont suffer abuse based on their race religion or sexuality we are not special victims the abuse is samey you will be rapedmutilated into silence its no surprise to me as i wrote preinternet there were angry people and whats more they had got hold of stamps and envelopesscary aeons ago sharon stone described hollywood thus if you have a vagina and an attitude in this town then thats a lethal combination the only thing thats changed since then is that now we all live in this town offline and on it so lets call out what it is we are fighting a conscious backlash against the gains that women have made when susan faludi wrote backlash in it was interesting but documented a different culture the us in the uk we had no strong religious right for example she then produced stiffed in about how men were suffering too underpaid and abandoned significantly though she had recognised that an antifeminist backlash occurs not when women have achieved equality but when there is any possibility that we might its a preemptive strike and here i would say its been going on for the past five years this is a strange time to be talking of backlashes when we have just seen several successful feminist campaigns but we need to understand the scale of what is happening i am glad there is a womans face on the money but can we have more actual money equal pay the reality is that in public life politics business and media we are grossly underrepresented there are constant attacks on abortion a push to make women dependent on partners iain duncan smiths belief and women are disproportionally hit by cuts the icons of the day are mute and respectable such as sam cam and kate middleton the backlash started in the early s when to be laddish and unpc was a bit a naughty liam gallagher described brilliantly by his brother noel as a man with a fork in a world of soup was its pinup right now we are dealing with something worse a rightwing establishment and its lackeys who have managed to convince themselves they are mavericks and who are openly antifeminist from toby young to james delingpole to guidos bloggers their putrid offerings are not outside the establishment but part of it they are just fagging for the tories they may do some childcare and fantasise about pj orourke but they encourage the bottomfeeders of the manosphere who never seem to realise that feminists not only have relationships with men but sons too a recession first reduces equality then liberty look at clegg wincing next to cameron the lib dems really dont do women at all they are just like liberal clegg is a classic example of a man who pays lip service to feminism but supports the backlash that stops women entering his hallowed territory the manopshere celebrates bojo getting rid of an adviser on women as he gets his leg over equal rights are just an s throwback tory women promote a fuzzy freefloating feminism marry well or have a cupcake business so when surrounded by angry men who feel belittled it is necessary to point out that women havent won actually we are losing our hardwon rights they still own most of the world those in power are legislating away womens rights at work making sure women are not promoted maintaining a status quo in which half the population are silent and invisible internet trolls are but fleas on the mangy coat of the backlash in popular culture as in politics as faludi wrote this is not an organised and centralised conspiracy its workings are encoded and internalised diffuse and chameleonic so as a humourlesss feminazi if i really need to explain that threatening to slit my throat and rape my entrails is not much of a joke then perhaps we just havent had that much feminism indeed postfeminism has splintered into tiny groups each policing their own identity politics with little sense of a bigger struggle but as the online cracks open up some light is shone on womenhating as more than a game the propaganda is everywhere what makes women unhappy equality it gives us careers cancer makes us drink too much it makes us ugly to men boohoo the backlash whispers in our ears that women secretly yearn for servitude not power those who say otherwise will be shut up no simply drown this out with noise pure noise and wake up its starting to happen remember all of them are just guys with forks in a world of soup we make the soup,2013-07,misogyny rather like poor always u dont worry going rehearse ok threaten rape woman online number quite ok little bit ok ok

philip clarke chief executive of tesco speaking to the observer yesterday now to reach an adequate standard of living jrf says that a lone parent requires a year and a working couple with two children need each the freeze in child benefit the decision to uprate tax credits by just and the increase in the cost of essentials faster than inflation means that a working couple with two children will be a year worse off that may not seem much to those fortunate enough to earn significantly more than the median salary of but a person on a minimum wage working hours a week receives less than a year these families are also about to navigate several weeks of school holidays perpetual struggle itself exacts a price donald hirsch author of the jrf report says there is a growing gulf between public expectations of the living standard everyone should be able to afford and their ability to earn enough to achieve it that is grossly unjust it is also economically unsound as john sentamu the archbishop of york argues on these pages the scale of low pay in britain is a national scandal five million people million of them women and four out of five working in the private sector receive pay so low they are subsidised by bn a year from the taxpayers purse why arent those who are profiting from their workers paying up the archbishop rightly asks why is government having to subsidise businesses who dont pay their employees enough to live on in a search for some of the answers the living wage commission created by the leftofcentre organisation compass has established a yearlong investigation into the future of the living wage its value and the barriers to its implementation to report in chaired by the archbishop it is timed to influence the manifestos of the political parties in the general election the observer welcomes the inquiry since last year it has published a series of articles on the working poor that have received a remarkable response from readers so it concurs with the archbishop of york when he says we need to have a national conversation about low pay in britain the voluntary living wage is set at an hour in london and in the rest of the uk the statutory minimum wage is set at an hour for those over due to rise by pence in october for well over a decade the charity citizens uk has led the campaign that now means almost companies pay the living wage to more than supporters are recruited from across the political spectrum including boris johnson ed miliband and alex salmond as well as leaders of most of the faiths justin welby the archbishop of canterbury says its something we should be shouting about the catholic bishops have also asserted fair wages are essential to the common good of society the moral argument is strong but so too are the economic drivers henry ford paid his workers a day not so they could buy his motor cars but to retain staff reduce absenteeism improve motivation and control training budgets according to jrf child poverty costs taxpayers bn a year despite the fact that of children in poverty have at least one working parent research by the thinktanks ippr and the resolution foundation suggests that in many sectors the cost of the living wage would be minimal banking construction and computing companies for instance would see roughly added to their wage bill even the retail sector would see only a rise we are on a precipice household debt according to aviva family finance has risen by in months as the resolution foundation has warned a rise in interest rates could tip more than a million families into the abyss and still the number of children slipping into poverty continues to increase the living wage is by no means the entire answer but it is a vital strengthening of the safety net instead according to jrf the new benefit universal credit is likely to make the economic situation for many working families worse not better as jeremy warner assistant editor of the daily telegraph has pointed out this is not the way capitalism is meant to work he adds the division of spoils has reached a level that if unaddressed threatens to be dangerously destabilising socially and politically there are strong economic reasons for a living wage and there are even stronger moral ones it is unjust that workers at the bottom of this countrys pay scale suffer so egregiously while executives ceos and shareholders help themselves to a disproportionate share of the spoils these spoils are often built on the back of the lowest paid workers this is unjust and unfair and ultimately

the government is planning to allow outsourcing firms to bid for contracts to manage social services for vulnerable children in england while dropping laws allowing the removal of companies that fail to do the job properly a number of firms have expressed an interest in proposals that would allow them to bid for contracts managing foster care and providing other services for children in care but labour says the plans would take away legal provisions that allow councils to remove a firm that has failed to meet national minimum standards they would also relax the rules governing independent inspections of services that place and monitor children who are looked after by the state concerns have emerged after two of the biggest outsourcing companies in britain serco and gs were found to have overbilled the taxpayer by charging to tag offenders who were dead or in prison lisa nandy the shadow childrens minister said the latest plans would leave some of britains most vulnerable children at the mercy of an unregulated private sector she has written to the regulatory reform committee which is considering a draft legislative reform order urging it to reject the governments plans for the government to consider outsourcing a sensitive service such as foster care to the private sector when we have just seen with gs and serco how a profit motive can have disastrous consequences for the public purse is madness the proposals remove many of the checks and balances required to ensure the safety of children whilst introducing the unchecked unpredictability of the market they should withdraw these proposals now and think again she said nandys letter said the reform order would remove the requirement for direct registration and inspection by ofsted of providers of social work services in england by amending the provision which imposes it it appears to remove the obligation for a national minimum standard relating to the fitness of providers and any mechanisms for removing providers who fail to meet these standards the implications are potentially very serious and could have a profound impact on the lives of some of the most vulnerable children in the country a department for education spokesperson said that even though some legal requirements would be removed under government plans inspections and a national minimum standard for providers would be covered by councils existing obligations the dfe said it was nonsense to suggest that privatesector and voluntary organisations cannot provide goodquality services for children and that the suggested change in policy was first explored under the last government the coalition has enthusiastically embraced such moves pilots in six areas where the private sector was involved inspected by ofsted were set up as a response to concerns that social workers were overburdened and unable to dedicate enough time to supporting children in care the evaluation published last year showed mixed results but no better outcomes for children in care an evaluation of the pilots by academics from kings college london the university of central lancashire and the institute of education found there was limited evidence for relocating public services for children in outofhome care to the private sector the study published last year in the children and youth services review concluded while the independent sector is often the setting for innovation the public sector continues to function as a repository for a wide range of expertise and resources it is also more likely to offer continuity of knowledge skills and care and in this respect it may be better placed to respond to the uncertainly that characterises the needs of children in outofhome care officials laid a draft statutory instrument before parliament on may which will be considered by the regulatory reform committee before coming back before parliament to be decided virgin care the social work provider that recently took over social care for disabled children in devon responded to the governments consultation it said it had not so far expressed an interest in bidding for future contracts but supported integrating health and social care serco is one of the outsourcing firms that may bid for any future contracts education sources said the firm is already involved in foster services in hertfordshire successful bidders would take over assessing children when they come into care deciding on the right care placement for them and monitoring the placement critics say the changes could also remove accountability through independent inspection and allow potential conflict of interest between private companies primary duties to their shareholders and their responsibility to children labour claims that the governments proposals leave a potential conflict of interest because the same company would be able to award placements monitor them and run them a spokesman for virgin care said what were about is improving services for the people who use them and integrating health and social care we will have a look at anything that will help us achieve that aim and help us provide services good enough for our own families the dfe said it is nonsense to suggest that privatesector and voluntary organisations cannot provide goodquality services for children arrangements to allow some councils to delegate social work functions relating to children in care were in fact first introduced by the previous government in we want those councils who ran successful pilots to be able to continue to do so and to make the same opportunities available to any council that wishes to use them devolved children in care services will be inspected by ofsted as part of their council inspection,2013-07,government

according to the office for national statistics the number of stayathome dads has doubled since while the number of women staying home to look after children has dropped by a third over the same period this is not quite the revolutionary inversion of gender stereotypes it sounds there are a million fewer stayathome mums but only about extra stayathome fathers taking up the slack i am not one of the extra ones ive stayed at home for virtually all of the past two decades although my wife is fond of pointing out that being an agoraphobic is not the same thing as being a househusband also i work from my house so my stayathome status has not over the years enhanced my childrearing skills as much as it has sharpened my ability to type while everyone around me is screaming there has been some talk about unfriendly taxation driving mothers out to work although the proliferation of men staying at home is undoubtedly a function of longterm economic imperatives its clear there has been a big rise in twoincome households but if the smaller salary cant cover the costs of childcare or the larger cant subsidise less wellpaid employment then the lower earner has to stay home its not really about who wants to or who should its nice to be needed though and theres is no question that im handy if a child falls ill and needs to stay off school i am here if another has ordered a secondhand xbox game off ebay i will be in to sign for it and im flexible i can usually adjust my schedule at a moments notice which is why i always happen to be incredibly busy when its time to feed the dogs if i missed anything about working in an office among normal people with their combed hair and fancy social skills it was coming home in the evening to little children who were thrilled to see me like i was when my dad came home these days its my children who come home to me with their ties askew and free newspapers under their arms i greet them excitedly at the door while they try to edge past me i ask them about their day and they mumble something about the people in charge being idiots i suggest a trip to the park they say maybe later as my children get older i feel less like a stayathome dad and more like a neglected pet it makes me wants to go downstairs right now and chew up something they own,2013-07,according office national statistic number stayathome dad ha doubled since number

over the past years jim clifford and his wife sue have adopted nine profoundly troubled children and given them a stable home now clifford hopes to pass on the benefit of his own experience launching a scheme to help up to challenging children a year to find stable adoptive parents the programme is structured as a social impact bond the experimental paymentbyresults model currently favoured by the government local authorities will pay in stages over two years on each adoption that proves successful given that it costs councils more than a year to keep a child in foster care this payment quickly represents a saving if a permanent home is found for the child cliffords desire to create a national model to improve adoption rates for older children who usually have more trouble finding new parents stems from his own positive experiences of taking on older children and his conviction that more people could become successful adoptive parents if they received sufficient support parents who want children tend to be childless couples and they have a mindset about wanting a baby and are tending to look for a young child the ones that go quickest are the youngest whitest cutest and singlest not in sibling groups the corollary is that if they are black or minority ethnic four or over not looking terribly cute or a sibling group they tend to stick on a shelf he says damaging experiences the main sticking point is that children who are older have usually been exposed to more damaging experiences and have often developed more challenging behaviour prospective parents are often very uncertain about their ability to cope they dont believe they are up to the challenge nobody believes they are until they do it clifford says they are scared by the lack of support because there are so many stories about taking on a child the child starts to explode and you cant see a social worker for dust thats scary you dont want to put your family through that every year about children are put up for adoption of those children about are quickly found homes by their local authority the other half are put on the national adoption register and become available to be picked by any parent who has been approved by a voluntary adoption agency or a local authority however on average clifford says of this group do not find homes and spend the rest of their childhood in foster care or in childrens care homes clifford argues that the solution lies in careful selection of the correct child for the correct parents inverting the current system where the parents select the child in a detailed assessment of the childs needs by a child psychiatrist from the maudsley hospital a psychiatric hospital in south london and in weeks of targeted training of the new parents in how to deal with that particular child by experienced social workers before the child arrives the its all about me adoption bond which clifford launches wednesday also guarantees roundtheclock support for the new parents for the first two years parents are taught how to give therapy to the child which can address some of the developmental problems that may have emerged as a result of their early experiences if we can absolutely guarantee to the parents that we will be there to support them even when everything is going loopy at three oclock in the morning and we can tell people that these sort of children are around and need families and are great and we can get people to believe they are up to the challenge and they could take them on then we would help the market enormously clifford says there will be telephone cover in the first instance phone advice from an experienced social worker who really does understand what they are doing even at am that is absolutely guaranteed they can be on the doorstep a short time after if they need to be the fee is about double the amount local authorities currently pay to voluntary adoption agencies to place a child but clifford is optimistic that the extra payment will be a good longterm investment it is about twice the price but it involves deliberate finding of the parents to suit the child and all the training specific to the childs needs and it embeds a very high level of support for the parents to help them learn and practise therapeutic parenting and to make sure the placement doesnt break down he says there are four stages when the local authority pays out a small amount on first registration on the scheme then a larger amount when the child is placed and moves in a further amount one year in and a further amount two years in this paymentbyresults model sounds as if it might encourage the fund to be risk averse in order to maximise the likelihood of receiving the full payment after two years but clifford explains that this will not be possible since local authorities will only want to pay over the odds for the hardertoplace children and not for straightforward cases success in this area will be hard to prove since there are no official statistics for the number of adoptions that break down for complicated reasons to do with guaranteeing the child and parents privacy after the initial adoption but clifford believes that broadly adoptions can currently be split into three categories a third that go very smoothly a third that struggle and a third that fail academic research suggests that for older children the failure rates are much higher rising to for nine to yearolds cliffords family struggled when they adopted their youngest child maisie who had two failed adoptions behind her and their experiences were charted in a moving bbc documentary in a home for maisie with the support of experienced professionals who helped him and his wife develop their parenting skills to meet maisies very specific needs the adoption has worked and the experience has been a very happy one which he hopes other parents can share clifford has developed the its all about me programme at baker tilly the chartered accountants where he heads the nonprofit advisory unit and works on this and other social impact bond projects it will be delivered by a large consortium of voluntary adoption agencies including action for children and pact two million pounds has been sought from big society capital and bridges ventures to fund children a year which will be topped up with another m from the cabinet office to cushion the startup process if more children are enrolled on to the scheme there are plans to raise more money so that up to children a year can be placed over the next decade clifford hopes the scheme will create secure homes for children who would otherwise have grown up without families these children dont have parents sitting on the doorstep waiting for them the conceptual basis is if you inform the parents support them and train them to deliver that childs needs so that they are doing it with their eyes open it will be more successful he says the children will require a more complex parenting style they will generally have greater needs or will be slightly older so will have had more experiences that have left them traumatised the children will need support and consequently the

it is an ordinary house on an ordinary street once you have been handed the key you can walk inside here is kayleigh and living with her violent boyfriend in the kitchen is helen in her s and married for years upstairs you meet sufiya newly arrived from pakistan to be married to a man she hardly knows among them all wanders a child charlie years old and terrified of the father who controls his every move this is the world created by our glass house a compelling piece of sitespecific immersive theatre exploring the impact of domestic abuse created by theatremakers evie manning and rhiannon white for their company common wealth the show takes place not in a theatre but in the heart of a local community last year it was performed in two houses in bristol in march this year it transferred to an empty flat on a bradford estate next month it will move to a house in edinburgh as part of the edinburgh fringe and in november it will come to london the show aims to plunge audiences into the tense claustrophobic atmosphere that pervades any home where violence and control are the norm and to make us think again about what might be happening behind closed doors six stories performed by actors from each local area but based on real testimony are staged simultaneously in different rooms audience members wander between them piecing together the scenarios as they unfold manning came up with the idea for the show last year she was at home one day when an ambulance pulled up on her street she discovered that a neighbours husband was extremely violent towards his family i had no idea at all of what was going on she says it really struck me this idea of what goes on behind closed doors and how powerful it would be to be in the house and to witness it she took her idea to white who immediately saw its potential especially because both herself and her mother had experienced abusive relationships white had known manning for years but they had never discussed any of this its not something i broadcasted to people white explains thats the main reason we decided to make the show the fact that domestic abuse is such a taboo subject when i was researching the show i went into a bookshop to ask for books on domestic violence and they actually whispered the words back to me white and manning interviewed survivors both male and female through the charities survive and mankind and they contacted the police and nhs agencies in bristol where they were living for key facts and figures their first interview was with a close relative of whites later white herself also spoke about her knowledge of children in abusive homes both she and manning wanted the character of the child charlie to be a key part of the show for me that was incredibly important white explains as a child living in an abusive home you take on the responsibility of being the adult in the household since that first batch of interviews the show has taken on a life of its own around people have seen it and several agencies dealing with domestic abuse have come on board the edinburgh production is partly funded by the scottish government the local council police and nhs with the result that tickets for the show are free lesley johnston a genderbased violence adviser with nhs lothian and chair of the edinburgh violence against women partnership sees the shows potential not only in raising awareness about domestic abuse but as a vital professional training opportunity theatre is a really powerful tool she says were hardnosed professionals were working in this field day in day out we go along and we hear presentations and the language is quite cold quite clinical seeing something visual like this gets you at a much deeper level theres no doubting the potential emotional impact of our glass house especially on those who have firsthand experience of domestic abuse white and manning advise any audience members who find the show too distressing to feel free to leave only a couple of people have done so representatives of local charities and refuges attend each performance which is then followed by a postshow discussion one male audience member emailed manning and white later to say that hed spoken to his mother about his abusive father for the first time a teenage girl told manning after the show that she was being raped by her boyfriend it was the first time she had admitted it to anyone it is in this capacity to unlock the silence that still surrounds domestic abuse that white and manning hope the shows power ultimately lies if anyone having seen the show white says feels able to ask the question of a friend or neighbour or to say that its happened to them before then maybe we can make a small difference this article was amended on july some personal details

the newspapers are beginning to ask themselves what tricks david cameron has up his sleevies when it comes to the challenge of winning the next election what or more accurately who could his secret weapon his electoral trident be andy coulson said in an interview in march that she was one of the few people to see to the heart of the matter while in a bizarre article in mondays times paywalled link tim montgomerie claims that her role is to keep the pm grounded and in touch with what voters are thinking its clear that its a woman and a woman who is keen to shift the tory narrative away from its championing of marriage and terror of feckless single mothers in a more voterfriendly direction a tactic that is also known as appealing to the ladies all of this sounds vaguely promising but before you start thinking that we have a new female political powerhouse on our hands i should probably inform you that this secret weapon is samantha cameron ne sheffield aristocrat smythsonpeddler woman of the people and most importantly david camerons wife they used to say in times of yore that behind every man was a great woman similar to the french saying je suis le patron mais cest ma femme qui commande it is a maxim that has become increasingly irrelevant in this age of pesky modern ideals such as female emancipation and financial autonomy the notion that a man exerts control in the outside world and the woman exerts control on him casts sam cam as some kind of spamdroidpuppeteering lady macbeth sinisterly whispering titbits in his ear about syria while lightly grasping his balls it is a notion as fustily conservative as the party itself just look at the vocabulary used in columns such as montgomeries shes bent her husbands ear about the humanitarian crisis in syria she charms those she meets and she turns the daily mails paul dacre a man whose morning meetings are referred to as the vagina monologues because of the frequency with which he employs the term cunt into a simpering fluffy mankitten lying spread eagled on his back in anticipation of the longedfor belly tickle as many will recognise the terminology is not so far removed from the language which tories used to describe the late margaret thatcher except of course maggie was elected and sam cam hasnt been she could its argued be a contender along the lines of hillary clinton but shes better behind the scenes montgomerie again in this sense she is a michelle not obama mominchief and political campaigner extraordinaire but michelle from destinys child doomed to be eclipsed by beyonc no matter because she listens to music as much as she does radio surely a woman exposed to the super furry animals with such regularity cannot be all bad indeed much like venerealdisease killing disinfectant sam cam is according to coulson badly needed in the trenches especially since cameron has been forbidden to like the smiths the problem is sam cam isnt so much disinfectant as she is an extra thick pair of long johns and as everyone knows with genital issues covering the problem up doesnt make it go away i dont expect sam cam to flush out the torys syphilitic bigotry so much as eclipse it like some kind of smythsoncarrying supermoon as mrs macbeth said look like the innocent flower but be the serpent undert there are cold adders lurking in the grass ladies and we would be wise to heed their presence i address members of my own gender in particular because they are the markedout targets for this spin campaign a woman albeit an unelected one pulling the strings may well increase the conservatives ratings in the polls we do like to see a broad in control after all one of our own kind except yknow for the aristocratic ties and the massive house those of us perhaps less susceptible to tb tory

georgia elms suffered a powerful range of emotions when her husband jon died suddenly from meningitis aged just the next day she discovered she was pregnant with their second child he went to bed feeling unwell in july and woke in the middle of the night a lot worse so i rang for an ambulance but by morning hed died in hospital says georgia from market harborough leicestershire it was awful it was two weeks after our daughter daisys first birthday and the day after his death i found out i was pregnant with scarlett she was left facing the practical and financial difficulties of raising a young family alone they had life insurance for jon and the payout covered their mortgage but the loss of his salary as a marketing consultant placed enormous pressure on the family finances we didnt get deathinservice as he was selfemployed and the impact on ongoing living costs and childcare were huge says georgia chair of charity widowed and young fortunately a payment from the government called the widowed parents allowance helped provide financial support georgia is eligible for a month until her youngest daughter leaves fulltime education this has been put towards childcare and basic living costs while i work parttime in a caf my old job wouldnt have fitted around the children so i havent gone back to that she says however this lifeline might not be available for widowed parents in future as the government is proposing a radical cut back from at present if youre a parent whose husband wife or civil partner has died and you have at least one child for whom you receive child benefit you may be able to get this allowance based on the national insurance contributions nics of the deceased person widows and widowers with children can claim up to a week and on top of this they get a oneoff taxfree lump sum of called a bereavement payment the weekly payouts which are taxable continue until the youngest child finishes fulltime education at either or or until a parent remarries reaches state pension age or they stop receiving child benefit the proposed changes outlined in the pensions bill currently going through parliament will limit this benefit to a maximum of a month paid out for just months with a lump sum of following bereavement the families already in receipt of the allowance will be unaffected by the reforms but charities say in future of widowed parents will be worse off under the new system both working and unemployed single parents will be better off in the first year after the death of a partner but opponents of the change warn that the larger lump sum will be swallowed up by increased funeral costs and other immediate demands they also point out that parents will miss out on up to years of monthly payments di stubbs spokesman for the childhood bereavement network says the changes could have a serious impact on childrens mental health and wellbeing young children who have suffered the devastating loss of their mum or dad are the wrong target for government cuts she says the majority of the surviving parents work and have paid into the system for many years before losing their partners often children will only start to be affected by a death two or even three years after the event debbie kerslake chief executive of cruse bereavement care adds bereaved children need support consistency and care the financial pressures caused by these changes will mean some parents having to work longer hours and move home uprooting a child at the worst possible time yet the government says the system needs to be simplified and that the benefit should be short term to support those without employment in making the return to work a dwp spokesperson says bereavement benefits are an important part of our welfare protection providing support for families through this very difficult time but the current system is overly complex and unchanged since the s the new benefit developed following wide research and work with charities and stakeholders will see more people eligible and ensure money is received when families need it most through acute shortterm financial pressures the payments will have no effect on entitlement to other benefits as they currently do with ongoing support provided through the wider welfare state a study by the dwp reveals that in the government expects to pay ma year to bereaved couples and families however because of the changes payouts would drop to m four years later robin williamson technical director of the low incomes tax reform group says the changes need to allow for more time following death for the bereaved with young children he adds that the system also doesnt reflect todays society with unmarried parents not entitled to any bereavement benefit the changes will have greatest impact on those with young children who are currently able to claim the benefit for up to years a family able to claim for years for example would be up to worse off with the average loss for working parents at or for unemployed parents according to calculations from the childhood bereavement network its vital for families to put in place financial safeguards whatever their circumstances to avoid relying on the government stresses philippa gee from philippa gee wealth management like writing a will you might prefer to put off making arrangements for the more serious occasions that life might throw at you but if you have people who are financially dependent on you and no cover in place you need to rethink your strategy if there is no life cover then those

i get under peoples skin my first book the morning after published in questioned whether women are partly responsible for date rape so it made people uncomfortable there were death threats and people criticised the way i looked the funny thing is i think people would agree with most of the things i said years on in my job im just trying to be critical we must never apologise for failing to be conventional its the aspect of modern life we still dont seem to have come to terms with who cares if kate winslet is on her third marriage having her third kid feminism is almost obsolete we cannot say that women dont get equal opportunities any more and we must stop questioning what has already been taken for granted we received the fundamental messages of the movement from our mothers in the s tackling residual sexist attitudes is the final frontier the child is king to organise your entire life around enriching your offspring is being more interested in being a parent than being yourself children no longer sneak out of bed and gaze wistfully at their parents party going on from the top of the stairs and thats a shame for everyone there is a condescension towards single mothers in the wider political sphere roiphe is a single mother of two in france they give single mothers preferential access to excellent daycare in america we have moralism disguised as concern the truth is that women move in and out of singleness people break up die have children outside of marriage still were regarded as either bohemian or falling apart its not healthy to be too healthy there are so many

for a traditional british conservative take on mens issues you cant get much more pure than the editor of the spectator writing in the telegraph in defence of his chum boris johnson the london mayor made a crass sexist joke this week about malaysian girls going off to university to find husbands fraser nelsons article is a familiar rehashing of the end of men narrative nicely nailed by my comment is free colleague sarah ditum on twitter its like he read hanna rosin but none of the reviews his analysis falls short on several fronts the first is a simple matter of reality nelson discusses the gender trends in education employment and relationships for young people up to the age of while completely ignoring that the picture changes profoundly when people have children second while noting that boys at the top are still doing just fine nelson never acknowledges that the problems are fundamentally economic and classbased above all for all the wailing and gnashing of teeth neither nelson nor johnson can offer a single prescription to heal the malaise the fundamental problem nelson identifies is that our society no longer has a pressing need for the attributes of traditional workingclass masculinity brute strength endurance and courage in the workplace a providers role at home there are two possible solutions to that the first would be an economic project to revitalise british manufacturing industry especially heavy industry which has shrunk by twothirds over the past years the second would be a social project to reinvent masculinity and gender roles in keeping with the world we have built both of these options are anathema to most conservatives the right sacrificed the prospects of young workingclass men when they abandoned a controlled economy to the whims of the global free market the coalition governments only notable reactions to the underachievement and alienation of young men has been to rail against deadbeat dads and to offer a pathetic cash bribe to couples as a reward for marriage there are signs that the mainstream left is beginning to awaken to the issues labour mp david lammy offered an insightful outline of some of the issues on fathers day calling on ed miliband and leftwing thinktanks to develop policies to make us the most familyfriendly nation in the world without really spelling out how that could be achieved diane abbott recently spoke about the crisis of masculinity in a wideranging and constructive speech but inevitably the headlines were grabbed by a paragraph or two portraying some young men as savage bundles of machismo misogyny and homophobia fuelled by pornography viagra and jack daniels for all the furrowed brows there is little sign of tangible change the spectacularly unequal outcomes for girls and boys in education are now beyond dispute schoolgirls are outperforming their male peers even in science and maths but when the tes and the guardian covered this news it was only with concern that it was not being translated into university admissions and postgraduate achievement i fully support efforts to get talented women into science engineering and technology but where are the similar efforts to inspire boys into medicine teaching nursing pharmacology or any of the other fields where they are falling ever further behind our culture both by omission and commission seems resigned to male underachievement while simultaneously berating young men for their failings my elder son finishes primary school next week and nervously prepares himself to enter the furnace of secondary education like all yearolds he has spent much of the last year being prodded and tested with sats and other blunt tools like a white mouse in a lab after one such experiment he told me proudly of his success i scored highest of all the boys he proclaimed after due expressions of support i couldnt resist asking about his other classmates oh yes lots of the girls scored more than me but they always do girls are just cleverer than boys it is possible that he has learned this lesson from observing his own mum and dad which would be an entirely legitimate reading of the evidence but i suspect there is something more to it than that before even leaving primary school he has absorbed a corrosive and pervasive myth about what should be expected from boys and girls its my responsibility to correct him on that it is our collective responsibility to work out where the myth has come from and what we can do to put it right,2013-07,traditional british conservative take men issue cant get much pure

the proposal for the independent school food plan recognises the importance of food in childrens health and welfare it says it aims to increase the number of children eating good food and to support cooking and vegetablegrowing initiatives in schools all admirable aims that i and others have been working on for nearly years so why have i got reservations the proposals for the reform of school food are fraught with difficulty claims and counterclaims they seem to be based on wishful thinking rather than evidence and designed to avoid constructive feedback the website is a series of alices adventures in wonderland claims and assertions full of cliches and hyperbole but it is not clear who is the mad hatter or the queen of hearts there seems to be a lack of recognition of years of research evidence in this area and a number of questions remain to be addressed the claims for school food and educational attainment are vastly overinflated and based on anecdotal or single case studies the reality is that schools that introduce improved school food rarely do so in the absence of educational initiatives there is of course a case for ensuring that children do not go hungry and thus lack concentration this should be considered a duty of care and one that the founders of the welfare state such as richard titmuss saw as a social duty the academic evidence of the impact of nutrition on educational attainment is poor in much the same way skills and knowledge such as those related to cooking and growing are not on their own sufficient to address wider social and food inequalities they are a necessary and important part of any wellrounded curriculum but acquisition of such skills does not change the circumstances in which people live education healthcare and other public services account for of meals served outside the home but only for of sales of food service with million schoolchildren to whom m meals are served every day for too long this chronic underinvestment has been ignored in favour of an approach seeking efficiencies in the system essentially a lowering of investment and costs the fudging on the website around nutrient standards and regulation is based on an assumption that headteachers need freedom to manage their own schools the evidence is clear regulation and setting standards which are enforceable lead to change by setting standards this provides a clear boundary and targets to achieve the current nutrient standards are based on science and while they may need some updating they should not be thrown in the dustbin the fact is that nutrient standards are about the food that students consume and not about some unobtainable standards which headteachers and caterers are expected to achieve school food can at best be a sticking plaster in the current round of decisions and cuts that families are making with respect to food every day lunches breakfast clubs and free school fruit are all important but only part of a wider picture it is hoped that the expert panel in its deliberations locates their considerations within this wider environment of change,2013-07,proposal independent school food plan recognises

the director of public prosecutions keir starmer is to launch an inquiry into why police forces are reporting fewer cases of rape domestic violence and child abuse than they were two years ago speaking as the crown prosecution service cps which he heads revealed record conviction rates for rape and domestic violence for the second year running starmer dismissed the suggestion that crime rates were falling i think there are more domestic violence cases out there than are reported to the police he said adding i would be slow to accept that the incident rate in this kind of crime has gone down starmer has called a meeting with police chiefs in september to discuss whether the police are doing enough to bring cases to court we need to start delving down into this issue he said this is the beginning of the inquiry rather than the end of it in may the family of maria stubbings who was murdered in by her former partner who had a history of violence urged the home secretary to launch a public inquiry into the response of the police and other state agencies to victims of domestic abuse they launched an online petition which has so far garnered more than signatures starmer who stands down in october stopped short of calling for a public inquiry but said it was important for the entire criminal justice system to understand what was happening in order to improve he aims to find out whether there are differences across police forces and whether there is a correlation between the fall in numbers and approach taken the number of incidents of domestic violence referred to the cps by police in the year to the end of march fell by leading to a total of prosecutions while fewer rapes were reported leading to prosecutions in a year in which historic child abuse has come to light such as that perpetrated by jimmy savile and stuart hall fewer cases alleging child abuse were referred resulting in prosecutions instead of being welcomed as a sign of falling crime these figures raises alarm bells that some forces are failing to gather enough evidence in the crucial first hour of a crime report evidence from refuge suggests that one in four women are victims of domestic violence while two women are killed as a result of it every week the stern review on rape reporting suggested that only of rapes come to the attention of the police during his time in office starmer has insisted that traditional attitudes towards victims of domestic violence and rape need to change victims such as those in the rochdale case in which young girls were groomed by far older men and used for sex as well as in historic cases such as savile were at the time believed to lack credibility and therefore criminals went unpunished convictions for domestic violence rose to of prosecutions in the year to march not far behind the average for other violent crime and up from in at the same time the rape conviction rate was up from last year ten years ago rape conviction rates were not recorded by the cps polly neate the chief executive of womens aid said we welcome the increase in conviction rates for domestic and sexual violence in the past twelve months and believe these figures reflect the dedication from the very top of the cps in addressing violence against women and girls however we need consistency in every police force area and work needs to happen in every force to support the cps in prosecuting these crimes she added that starmer a former human rights barrister had been a powerful force for change over the past five years but we still have a long way to go and there is still much to do to increase reporting prosecution and conviction of domestic and sexual violence as violence against women and children is so widespread professor liz kelly the cochair of the end violence against women coalition said i hugely appreciate what has been done at the cps under his watch compared to what was done previously it isnt just that the numbers keep going up but its the only government department with a really coherent strategy on violence against women i feel quite anxious about what is going to happen on this issue without him with a successor expected to be announced by the attorney general in the coming weeks starmer sought to assure campaigners that the cps would continue to focus on violence against women and girls under my tenure we have worked hard to built it into to our governance arrangements so its in the top indicators that we track its so much part and parcel of the way the cps does its business that its not just one dpp before he leaves he hopes to have published guidelines on the way the police and prosecutors handle cases of child abuse theres a fighting chance of getting that done in the autumn he said asked if the conviction rates for sexual crime could ever match that of other crimes he said there was no reason why not but that it would take a coordinated effort starmer said the cps also has to work with the courts and juries when it comes to myths and stereotypes police and prosecutors wont allow them to cloud their approach and then they can reappear when the case gets to court,2013-07,director

adopted children arrive in new families like lost jigsaw puzzle pieces and in the rush to try to get them fitted in snugly its tempting to paint over the old pattern smooth over the sharp corners and try to hammer them home a fine approach if youre taking on a dog or hamster that wont one day grow up and start asking awkward questions but not one that does people any good at all so while theres a national debate about the naming of children and the class implications of certain names can i ask as a representative of my local adoption panel that we put down our tools of class warfare throw aside snark and prejudice and allow adopted children to be themselves a product of dual heritage for prospective parents some aspects of the adoption process share an unhappily common aesthetic with brochure shopping snap judgments are made based on a picture and a little bit of information as it is hard to face the consequences of sending a child back for one that is a better fit names become a key factor alongside facial expression haircut clothes and whether they look like a little scamp or a scary monster its a queasy process all round and one prospective adopters just have to wade through not thinking too hard about it they look at photographs read profiles wait until a face starts to sing out and make the appropriate inquiries expectations can be hard to manage intense feelings are in play and during the wait for approval that is a necessary part of the process its easy for the imaginary babyshaped void that has grown within a prospective family for which the parents will have spent years suggesting names to become competition for any real children that may be about to arrive these children have a past they come from somewhere other where the customs are not the same the voidbaby on the other hand is a perfect family fit an empty vessel with no residue left from a previous owner this is the point at which making judgments about children from a first name alone becomes troubling adoption is often a case of middleclass families taking on children from nonmiddleclass backgrounds and when those families worry about taking on a child because their name could lower the tone well theres that queasiness again there are children appealing children with smiley faces struggling to find new homes and news reports claiming that prospective adopters are somehow so put off by these names they would rather remain childless you have to ask yourself who is adopting whom whose needs are being met here and where are the grownups it is at this point that the voidbaby really should be packed away and space in the household cleared for the emotional and physical baggage of a real child and that is hard some prospective adopters have a tough time accepting that there is still a birth family out there and that the story of birth mum and where possible birth dad should be passed along in parallel with the history of their own grandparents uncles and nieces and as these stories often contain unpleasant details requiring careful handling it is easier to try to wipe the slate clean cant we just give the children new names unless theres an issue of security in which case identity takes second place to personal safety the answer to that question should most often be no and the reason is simple an adopted child should never grow up ashamed of where they came from otherwise theres a risk that they will develop void people of their own and thats a competition all parents can well do without,2013-07,adopted child arrive new family like lost

when she tells her story jane passes over the way her exhusband was violent on occasion and created an atmosphere that was usually aggressive what really destroyed her independence she says was the financial abuse it wasnt just that he never contributed anything to their finances despite working full time the problem was that everything she earned through the beauty treatment business she set up was confiscated by him and his mother they controlled how much salary i received and when i received it she says looking back on half a lifetime of manipulation but jane not her real name is far from

see panel married at jane sought a divorce at however she says my husband said he would only contribute to the school fees and the mortgage if he had a proper relationship with me if he slept with me so she stayed on with him for five years after the divorce jan pahl professor of social policy at the university of kent is not surprised at the natcen analysis she conducted research years ago in which it emerged that a quarter of women in refuges were better off there as their husbands had given them no money at all but she is distressed that the plight of abused women is as bad as ever and arguably about to get worse the disaster is the new universal credit she says this ministers claim will simplify the benefits system by bringing all the strands of support from housing benefit to tax credits into one payment with a national rollout due to begin in october but concerns have been voiced that where this benefit is paid to one member of a couple it will play into the hands of financial abusers it will be a single monthly payment into a bank account recipients will be asked to nominate where the money should be paid into either a single account in their or their partners name or a joint account in both of their names other parts of government policy also disadvantage victims campaigners say the guardian revealed in may that a victim of domestic violence who faces losing her council home which has a secure panic room is to challenge the governments socalled bedroom tax council officials told the woman she would lose a week from her benefits on the grounds that she has a spare room the womans case is being supported by the charity womens aid jane did escape with the help of the man who is now her second husband but her story and that of her two teenage sons was so complicated that while one court awarded her custody of them a second court gave custody to the former motherinlaw who had previously appropriated her earnings now jane is still involved in anguished battles to spend time with her children but she is in a stronger position and because she qualified as a teacher while still with her ex she has money to support her cause what advice does she give others education is the key you can go and support yourself with a qualification and she urges people to get advice early when she finally got herself to womens aid there was very very quick progress i could have gone to them ages before what to do if you are worried keep a secret kitty even if it is just enough to get the train to a refuge keep receipts of items you have bought so you have some claim to them if you split up learn the basics of finance yourself if your partner controls all the household money try to get some income coming in to your account test the water to see how your partner reacts if you suggest a fairer division a bad reaction would suggest that you need a plan b including ideas for an escape route get confidential advice from womens aid or citizens advice for instance work out how you could earn a living if you left if starting a new relationship discuss money before moving in together and note the tone of responses you get suggestions that you do not trust your partner because you do not want to relinquish control of your assets are a sign of manipulation and perhaps worse to come if you were brought up in an abusive environment recognise that you may be psychologically vulnerable to abusers in your adult relationships but that you can reduce this tendency by recognising and acting on it,2013-07,tell story jane pass way exhusband wa violent

where should a something feminist go when faced with a online barrage of rape and death threats unsurprisingly laura bates turned to an anonymous talkboard to ask for help soon after she founded the everyday sexism project months ago less predictably perhaps the childless campaigner chose to do so on parenting website mumsnet within hours bates had almost responses they ranged from the serious to the scatological but all of them were supportive to her concerns that she was being followed online basilfoultea wrote well if theyre stalking this one hallo nobbers i bet you needledick wankers cant get a woman to shag you on a voluntary basis because youre all repulsive with halitosis and a total lack of sex appeal and charisma that was the first time id laughed since the emails began says bates who is now feted by politicians and companies alike for her work tackling sexism i have a real soft spot for mumsnet much has been written over the past few months about socalled fourth wave feminists young media and internetsavvy women like bates whose online petitions and direct action campaigns from uk feministas campaign against supermarkets displaying lads mags to no more page which has so far garnered signatories asking the sun newspaper to scrap its pictures of barebreasted women are tackling some longstanding issues far less remarked upon however has been a quieter revolution that has been going on for some time in anonymous forums about all sorts of subjects from baking to relationship advice to work crises and very often in spite of those who argue that retreating into motherhood is not feminism as they know it on sites such as mumsnet the website with its four million users nearly all of whom are women is possibly the most mainstream and politically important example of this slowburn resurgence in feminist thought natasha walter the feminist author was struck by the supportive atmosphere of mumsnet when she was writing living dolls the return of sexism a few years ago it was quite a dark time for feminists before the current campaigns against twitter and page it just wasnt mainstream people werent challenging everyday sexism so i was really struck by the conversations on mumsnet id go on and listen and be heartened by the way women were responding the sort of anonymity that has been so problematic on the web has also allowed women to speak out about sometimes appalling abuse mumsnet founder justine roberts says the original we believe you campaign to raise awareness about rape and sexual assault was a good example of this a safe anonymous space for people to post accounts of things that had happened to them often decades ago and say i was sexually assaulted and id always just shrugged it offblamed myself last month mumsnet looked into whether its members regarded themselves as feminist roughly twice as many identify themselves as feminist as those who do not more importantly the respondents are more likely to selfidentify as feminists since joining mumsnet with just doing so before joining support for feminism is all over the site on the busy relationship and advice threads not just on the feminist talkboards set up in one member who wants to remain anonymous due to her work with antiviolence campaigners writes in an email if you look at the answers on the relationship threads they are kneejerk progressive and prowomen on porn and prostitution it isnt feminist theory boring but reallife stuff thats happening again answers to these are supportive many of the mumsnet feminists i talked to said they had always been feminists but not academic ones as if a discussion of intersectionality and gender theory were the real ways to define themselves as believing in equality rather than the way they chose to live their lives in the survey agreed with the statement that being part of the social network of other women made them more likely to consider the feminist perspectives on everyday issues such as domestic abuse agreed that mumsnet had changed their views about what constitutes such abuse and a similar percentage said it made them think differently about how i parent my children when it comes to gender roles nicola hillary who lives in gloucestershire with her two small children started donating to womens aid as a direct result of what she learned from others on the site i hadnt realised what a horrible situation domestic violence is for so many women she says it was quite a revelation i suppose because its hidden in society and people dont talk about it the survey results and comments do not mean that all mumsnetters are feminist of course that would be like saying all twitter users are misogynists a diverse site known almost as much for its bustups and bitchiness as for its parenting advice is never going to offer one view on life but mumsnet and sites like it are providing a platform for women to talk and listen to the views and lives of others making the personal political may have become a cliche but social media has given it new legs of course many oldschool feminists balk at the very name mumsnet in a twitter debate earlier this year for instance novelist judy astley wrote am s feminist have seen huge changes that you all take for granted feminism about so much more than mother parenthood journalist ticky hedley dent shot back i think mumsnet is key to understanding feminism feminism hardly comes into play until you have kids then you get it many women have spoken of the shock to your sense of self that comes when you have a child in her book a lifes work on becoming a mother for instance rachel cusk writes that childbirth and motherhood are the anvil upon which sexual inequality was forged and the women in our society whose responsibilities expectations and experience are like those of men are right to approach it with trepidation women have changed but their biological condition remains unaltered as such motherhood provides a unique window to the history of our sex but its glass is easily broken in shattered modern motherhood and the illusion of equality rebecca asher a former editor on bbc radio s womans hour described how the machine of motherhood transports us back to the s today women outperform men at school and university they make a success of their early careers and enter into relationships on their own terms so it might seem that equality is in the bag but once they have children their illusions are swiftly shattered when i call her on her mobile the unmistakable sounds of a noisy playground intrude motherhood galvanised her own feminism she says it gave me an extra anger and really drove my feminism why she hoots with laughter there are let me see about three men here looking after children and or women lisa parry a yearold freelance writer living in cardiff dismisses the distinction between caring about issues the politics and working out how to live your life the personal i dont see any contradiction between saying women should earn the same as men and saying i want my son brought up well i just dont see that as less of a feminist thing in fact its a feminist act to bring him up to regard both sexes as equal she cites the conversations shes had on talkboards since having her son months ago as changing her opinion that all feminists have to work outside the home before i had a kid i thought feminists should work but there are some people who cant this realisation has made me think about feminism differently yet alison starr a keen mumsnetter who is older than the average at has been surprised at how many members still post suggesting they cant be feminist because they stay at home to look after the kids there is a lot of feminist support but its probably with a small f and not a big one she says wearily the sorts of labels put on feminists were most apparent in a separate much smaller survey carried out by netmums last year which found that few of its members described themselves as feminist because they liked makeup and men asher is less receptive to the idea that social media is helping mothers support each other having experienced a bullying side to mumsnet during discussion of her book social media is as divisive as it is unifying it can really polarise debate as people have very strong personal opinions about motherhood and social media is all about social expression if mumsnetters tend to be feminists with a small f as starr says they are also political with a small p these women are more likely to unite over certain issues pinkification of girls toys for example than their support for a particular party or person in this way the site echoes other online campaign groups and an increasing trend in our national life where support for mainstream political parties has waned as specific campaigns against fracking for badgers etc have united individuals the frontline of a new wave of feminist behaviour or a site where middleclass parents gather to discuss schooling and velcro shoes mumsnet is many things to many people but its impact on the way many live their lives should not be overlooked as natasha walter says of course feminism still needs a radical edge but the power of mumsnet is that its a very very comfortable space women can talk about baking and all this feminism too whats wrong with that,2013-08,something feminist go faced online

millions of working parents struggling to juggle the demands of generating an income with caring for a family are being urged to consider flexible alternatives outside the workplace to help manage the burden parents estimate they are on average a month worse off from the childcare they provide equating to nearly a year according to figures given to the observer by scottish widows thinktank the centre for the modern family meanwhile the cost of two parents bringing up a child up to the age of now amounts to according to research last week from the child poverty action group cpag and cofunded by the joseph rowntree foundation a total of about a week to cover food clothing heating childcare and other expenses yet while the rising cost of living stagnant wages and government cuts to benefits have placed pressure on family finances there are a range of solutions to make ends meet such as freelance and work that can be done at home direct selling parents could sell goods by working from home for a member of the direct selling association the uk trade body it allows people to run their own microbusinesses and choose the hours and level of work they wish to do says lynda mills director of the dsa its a completely flexible option which makes it attractive to parents who may want to work around their children given the high cost of childcare upfront costs average around for a business kit and sample products earnings vary depending on the time and effort invested adds mills one mum who is taking advantage of the flexibility of direct selling is joanne weston who has become an ambassador for barefoot books a childrens publishing firm which operates via a community of homebased social sellers she estimates she earns around an hour plus some extra from events joanne is

britain risks sleepwalking into a world where inequality becomes so entrenched that our children grow up in a state of social apartheid according to a leading charity in a damning report to be published next week the national childrens bureau finds that in many respects child poverty is now a bigger problem than during the s when it carried out a seminal study born to fail the report compares aspects of childrens lives today to data from the born to fail cohort study of yearolds carried out in it finds that significantly more children are growing up in relative poverty today million compared with million and claims that these children suffer devastating consequences throughout their lives it adds today although there have been some improvements overall the situation appears to be no better and in some respects has got worse the report finds that a child from a disadvantaged background is still far less likely to achieve a good level of development at four than a child from a more privileged home children living in deprived areas are much more likely to be the victim of an unintentional injury or accident in the home children from the poorest areas are nine times less likely than those living in affluent areas to have access to green space places to play and to live in environments with better air quality boys living in deprived areas are three times more likely to be obese than boys growing up in affluent areas and girls are twice as likely our analysis shows that despite some improvements the inequality and disadvantage suffered by poorer children years ago still persists today said dr hilary emery the bureaus chief executive there is a real risk that our society is sleepwalking into a world where children grow up in a state of social apartheid with poor children destined to experience hardship and disadvantage just by accident of birth and their more affluent peers unaware of their existence the report warns that britain could become a place in which childrens lives are so polarised that rich and poor live in separate parallel worlds it draws comparisons with other developed nations and claims that a lack of ambition causes children in the uk to suffer unnecessarily as a result patterns of disadvantage could become permanent features of our society the charity claims that if the uk emulated the example of those european countries deemed to be the best places to grow up in the deaths of children through unintentional injuries alone could be prevented every year more to yearolds would be in education or training and nearly fewer yearolds would be obese both the previous and current governments have made tackling child poverty a key commitment there has also been an emerging consensus among politicians that more needs to be done to help working parents in order to lift families out of poverty the reports authors praise the strides made in improving young childrens access to nurseries and playgroups but they note that the majority of children growing up in poverty have at least one parent or carer who is in work the charity is calling for urgent action from the government to address the poverty and disadvantage that it claims still wreaks havoc on childrens lives causing them to lag far behind their more affluent peers in almost all areas of their lives from health to education early development to housing the report also notes the government made a commitment to protect pensioner benefits but there has been no equivalent commitment to protect children living in the poorest families or to tackle child poverty there are concerns that changes to the benefits system will see evergreater numbers of children fall into poverty in the coming years further threatening the uks goals of significantly reducing the problem by the coauthor of the original born to fail report said that the fact that so little had changed showed a failure of political will you are always going to get people saying we will always have poor people said peter wedge emeritus professor at the university of east anglia that cannot be denied but it is the gap between that is important it is about what happens to those who have resources and those who dont we can change that as a society if we have the will,2013-08,britain risk sleepwalking world inequality becomes entrenched child grow state social

it was the year of the moon landing concordes first flight and the start of civil strife in northern ireland the beatles staged an impromptu concert on the rooftop of apple records in london the average british house cost just over and two million children in britain were classed as living in poverty the latter figure was contained in born to fail a groundbreaking examination of the experiences of children living at the tail end of the s produced by the national childrens bureau unveiled in to media fanfare the report featured on the front of time magazine and had a galvanising effect on politicians the labour firebrand barbara castle would quote chunks of it in the commons and born to fail was credited with having a formative influence on gordon brown who would later make eradicating child poverty by a key goal of the labour government fast forward more than years and much has changed no one goes to the moon any more concorde no longer flies the beatles and the troubles are subjects for historians but despite successive governments best intentions childhood poverty and inequality continue to blight millions of lives and according to the bureau in a new snapshot of britains poor in certain respects things are worse than they used to be decades of increasing prosperity have seen the average house price soar to almost but now an estimated million children live in relative poverty the new bureau report greater expectations is to be published this week commissioned to mark the charitys th anniversary it traverses the same terrain as its influential predecessor and comes after a series of missed targets in tackling child poverty browns goal proved to be unachievable an interim target to reduce the number of children in poverty by a quarter by was not met the subsequent child poverty act which received crossparty support and was accepted by the coalition when it came to power created a new commitment to reduce the proportion of children living in relative poverty to less than by the reports authors question whether such targets go far enough they ask do we want every child to have the same life chances regardless of their parents means does it matter if childhood is so unequal and the experiences of growing up for children are so polarised as one of the richest nations on earth should we have greater expectations and higher aspirations for our children clearly politicians agree that the answer to those angrily posed questions should be yes in david cameron stated that we all know in our hearts that creating a good society for children to grow up in is one of the greatest tests of any nations character but the new reports findings suggest the uk is failing that test and argues that politicians need to be more ambitious far from improving over time the situation today appears to be no better than it was nearly five decades ago the report warns topline figures that jump out from the report include the claims that the number of children in relative poverty defined as those living in families with income below of the median after housing costs have been factored in has increased by million since a child from a disadvantaged background is still far less likely do well in their gcses at than one from a more privileged home children living in deprived areas are much more likely to be obese than those living in affluent areas children from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to suffer accidental injuries at home children living in the most deprived areas are much less likely to have access to green space and places to play such divisions have consequences for the whole fabric of society the bureau argues it creates a them and us society with far greater tensions the report warns the riots of the summer of were a warning of how easily these tensions can spiral out of control but there are economic reasons too for why we should be concerned about this situation for our children quite simply we cannot afford so many of the nations future generation to be cut adrift adding to the welfare bill and allowing desperately needed talents to be unfulfilled the world has changed in the years between when the reports were published making comparisons and definitions problematic however the bureau insists that it has drawn together data from official sources that provides a reasonable comparison with the findings of born to fail helpfully for the purposes of comparison the number of children in the uk around million has remained largely unchanged since but despite the fact that the child population has remained largely static the number living in relative poverty has risen from two million in to million today to put it another way one in four children in the uk is now classed as living in relative poverty according to the bureaus data a child from a disadvantaged background is still far less likely to achieve a good level of development at age four to do well at school aged and do well in their gcses at compared to a child from the most welloff backgrounds the report suggests that today boys living in deprived areas are still three times more likely to be obese than boys growing up in affluent areas it also found that babies born into disadvantaged homes were still more likely to be underweight there is emerging evidence that levels of child poverty will rise in the coming years a recent institute for fiscal studies analysis predicts that changes to the tax and benefit changes system will result in more children living in poverty by by the figure is predicted to rise to million the government disputes some of these predictions but it has acknowledged that a further children will move into poverty as a result of the benefit changes such a trend threatens to undo the positives that have been achieved in recent years in only of disadvantaged children went to playschool day nursery or playgroup compared with of their more advantaged peers today of those aged three and four in england attend early education a figure that reflects how both the previous and current governments accept the arguments for the longterm benefits of an early education however here too are inequalities while nearly two thirds of fouryearolds achieve a good level of development during their early years education less than half on free school meals hit the target and the gap between the achievements of disadvantaged children and their peers continues through to gcse level with far fewer disadvantaged children achieving at least five ac grade gcses including english and maths the charity argues more should be done to close the gap it wants a children and young peoples board to develop new strategies to reduce inequality and for the office for budget responsibility to disclose the impact each budget would have on child poverty and inequality it points out that if the uk reduced its child poverty levels to that of denmark the best performing country according to data from the organisation for economic cooperation and development almost a million children would be lifted out of poverty if it were to match iceland in the child health stakes fewer babies would be born underweight improving their chances of being healthier in childhood and doing well at school and if it were to follow the example of norways housing system fewer children under five would be living in poor environmental conditions but these aspirations are unlikely to be realised greater expectations carries a warning in its conclusion the fact that the poverty and inequality experienced by our children remains just as prevalent today as it did nearly years ago must not be ignored and with cuts to services and welfare benefits now taking hold those children living in lowincome families are set to experience even greater hardship and the gap between them and others is set to grow even wider,2013-08,wa year moon landing concordes first flight start civil strife northern

a cleaner on the minimum wage would lose out by working while a teacher could be better off under the governments new childcare plans according to a new analysis the resolution foundation thinktank warns that the coalitions proposed additional support for childcare will benefit higherpaid second earners and their families far more than those who are low paid the research shows that a teacher on an hour with two children in childcare would be a week better off if she worked hours a week than if she did not work at all by contrast a cleaner with two young children in childcare earning the minimum wage would be a week worse off if she worked hours a week than if she did not work at all chancellor george osborne has announced the government will spend an extra bn a year on two types of childcare support about working families receiving financial assistance through universal credit may be potentially eligible for extra childcare support from in which they can claim back of their costs a further million higher income families not eligible for benefits will be able to claim taxfree childcare through vouchers worth up to a year per child from extra help will be only for families on universal credit in which all adults earn above the income tax threshold expected to be in the resolution foundation believes working families will miss out on extra help with childcare because all the adults in the family do not earn enough to pay income tax lowpaid second earners will be no better off if they move from parttime to fulltime work despite the governments intention to make work pay giselle cory senior analyst at the resolution foundation said its neither fair nor logical if someone on a low wage such as a cleaner who wants to boost the family income by taking on more work gets less help with that than a higher earner such as a teacher the new support for the high costs of childcare is very welcome and millions of families will be better off as a result of the scheme however the people it helps the least are the very people for whom the cost of childcare is the biggest disincentive to work its vital that the government acts to correct this anomaly by paying the higher rate of childcare support under universal credit to all working families no matter how lowpaid even if this means reducing the generous support to relatively high earners who qualify for the

the poorest working families will not benefit from the governments proposed childcare support and could lose money under the scheme while those higher up the income scale will get substantial payments according to a leading thinktank the resolution foundation says lowerincome working families with children will miss out on the planned additional childcare support because all the adults in the family will not earn above the income tax threshold of a prerequisite before the state assistance kicks in parents who do qualify will be able to claim back of their childcare costs up from but families where both parents work and receive universal credit but only one adult earns enough to pay income tax will in effect be denied the increased support that the government is offering ministers argue that the additional support is intended to ensure work pays for parttime second earners usually mothers who want to increase their hours towards fulltime since those on lowest incomes face the highest barriers to work from childcare costs the foundation says that minimum wage earners could see cash losses if they try to work their way out of poverty the paper released on saturday shows lowpaid teachers will get help with childcare whereas those in lower paid occupations such as cleaners will lose out it calculates that a teacher on an hour with two young children in childcare would be a week better off if she worked hours a week than if she did not work at all in contrast a cleaner with two young children in childcare earning the minimum wage would be a week worse off is she worked hours a week than if she did not work at all the system is so complex that it becomes extremely difficult for a second earner to predict when the cleaner will become better or worse off as her hours increase says the resolution foundation the thinktank says much of the reporting about the scheme has focused on government claims that stayathome mothers made a lifestyle choice and would not be eligible for childcare vouchers worth a year a child but this is largely about those wealthier families and neglects the argument about the poor the paper says ministers should extend the rate of childcare support to all families rather than just those in which all adults pay income tax this would cost m which the study says could be found from the bn new investment in childcare by limiting taxfree childcare vouchers for the very rich under the current proposals a couple with a joint income of up to can get in state subsidy giselle cory senior analyst at the resolution foundation said its neither fair nor logical if someone on a low wage such as a cleaner who wants to boost the family income by taking on more work gets less help with that than a higher earner such as a teacher its vital that the government acts to correct this anomaly by paying the higher rate of childcare support under universal credit to all working families no matter how lowpaid even if this means reducing

up to per year per child a department for work and pensions spokesperson did not dispute the analysis but said ministers are investing m in childcare support under universal credit along with the bn

there has been a sharp rise in the number of children being adopted with last year showing the largest annual increase in years official figures show according to the office for national statistics ons there were adoptions in england and wales last year a increase on when there were despite the good news there are also concerns that longterm trends continue unabated the percentage of adopted children aged one to four has increased to in almost double that in by contrast the percentage of adopted children aged to an age group considered harder to place as they often have more complex problems has more than halved from in to in the ons also says that children born outside marriage are more likely to be adopted than those born within marriage in its data release it points out that while in nearly half of all babies in england and wales were born outside marriage or civil partnership of children adopted were born outside marriage the drive has been spearheaded by education secretary michael gove himself adopted whose department is responsible for adoptions he has put forward measures to increase adoption rates including a bill to take away the powers of local authorities that are failing to find adoptive parents and to hand those powers to the voluntary or private sector although many of the new policies will come into force after the latest statistics were collected the ons said it is possible that the increased number of adoptions in could be a consequence of the recent drive to improve the adoptions process in england and in wales there have been some significant changes local authorities now have to pay a flat rate of a child to whoever places the child rather than cutting deals with other councils and league tables reveal how swiftly children in need of adoption are placed with families ministers said it was simply not acceptable that there are about children in care waiting to be adopted recent figures show youngsters wait nearly months on average before finding a new family the ons figures were welcomed by experts as a sign of progress however it will be some time before it becomes clear whether the push to get more children into families is paying off claudia wood of the thinktank demos said obviously if you have to wait months before adopting a child then it becomes emotionally harder to bond this is true for babies and for older children so it definitely helps that the government has speeded up the process from july councils will have to place children within six months the consortium of voluntary adoption agencies

something about getting more money into the sector and changed the law but the country needs to see families coming forward to adopt children otherwise we will end up with a lot of children who we say can be adopted and nowhere for them to go the governments focus on getting nonstate solutions has attracted city investment to the adoption market last month saw the launch of a social impact bond

and the cvaa it should ensure voluntary organisations find train and support families to adopt children and receive payment based on their success in securing permanent placements local authorities will pay up to for a successful adoption in several instalments ending after the placement has lasted for two years by doing this at a lower cost than the state the idea is that some of the savings can be used to repay investors financiers could receive a return of a year together with a final payment that could be up to of their investment hannah dobbin policy manager at action for children said we need to see more innovative approaches to ensuring that children are placed with families that can meet their individual needs and can offer them the stability they need a department for

i have been thinking a lot about the term empowerment of late which is one of those words like closure that you almost never used to hear and its now difficult to get through a magazine without encountering after much philosophical pondering i have come to the measured conclusion that it is as we say in the linguistics world bollocks whereas once this noble word referred to the bestowing of power it now invariably refers to celebrity narcissism beyonc shows film clips which mistake female empowerment for narcissism the guardian august or more commonly as justification for women being reduced to sexual objects as these are two especially tedious blights on the modern age i think it would benefit us all if we simply did away with the word youve had your time empowerment off you go to your retirement village in andalucia have a lovely rest youve earned it i have been wearying of empowerment for some time and the times when im especially weary of it are when i discuss how weird it is that so many alist female celebrities feel compelled to take their clothes off on the covers of magazines only for someone to retort that actually these women are empowering themselves quite when the word empowerment became a euphemism for offering oneself up as a wank object is not recorded in the oxford english dictionary this linguistic debate took another turn this week with an interview in the times with seren haf gibson paywall a former glamour model who is unimpressed by the campaign to ban lads mags gibson is frustrated that some people claim she and other glamour models were victims when they were posing in lads mags and understandably so what right do other people have to define her experience it feels especially frustrating she says because when she was modelling and nuts dubbed her the brilliant booby babe her choice was celebrated she recalls as empowering we were the power generation you can be whoever you want to be everything you did was empowering i have written before about how choosing ones path is a feminist act for a woman but that doesnt mean the choice you make is and if that choice results in you being branded as brilliant booby babe it is fairly safe to assume that the only empowerment going on here is the empowerment of someones bank account maybe yours more likely someone elses by the use of your naked body posing on the cover of nuts is to empowerment what geri halliwell and girl power are to feminism i have no doubt gibson doesnt feel victimised by her experience as a glamour model that doesnt mean she was empowered either but if empowerment has been bludgeoned into meaninglessness lads mags which once empowered so many women are an orgasmic gasp away from to the recycling bin zoo and nuts sales are down respectively and year on year and the escalating campaigns against them may well hasten those numbers down further the coop has insisted nuts be placed in modesty bags which sounds like the term ones gran might use for sanitary towels your sister went out to buy some modesty bags which nuts has refused to do tesco has struck what is described as a modesty deal saying that it has extracted promises from some lads mags to make their covers more modest clearly lads mags are embarrassing indefensible and tragic but how much difference will their inevitable demise make terri white an exeditor of nuts wrote in the guardian that the culture lads mags helped to create can still be seen in town and cities all around the uk and shes right the world long ago overtook lads mags which is precisely why theyre failing so in order to staunch this problem here is a list of other things id like to place modesty bags over aside from the word empowerment any celebrity who becomes famous via the medium of a sex tape while its too late to save ourselves from paris hilton ray j and kim kardashian we can take steps to ensure no more follow in their wake any advert in which a woman appears to have an orgasm over a food product the exotic powers of chocolate on women only mind with men chocolate makes them more manly have been well mined from the ol flake in the bathtub to that bizarre advert this year in which a chocolate bar made a teenage girl flirt with her boyfriends dad um great but i recently saw an advert in which a woman had an orgasm on a sofa over an apricot yoghurt that looked and im sorry for the frankness but too bad like vomit incidentally why do men never have orgasms over anything in adverts who knew it was so easy to turn on women but so hard to turn on men anything that involves all women being naked and all men being clothed well by anything i mean adverts music videos anything artdirected by tom ford i dont mean you know surgery where a male doctor is performing on a female patient i would similarly like to modesty bag any attempts to justify said art direction such as the ridiculous robin thickes contention that his grim song and grimmer video which he once happily described as degrading to women are actually a feminist movement very empowering too no doubt overly sexualised celebrity selfies remember when we werent subjected to instagrammed photos of male and female celebrities getting themselves off by admiring how sexy they are id like to go back to that time hmm you know what i feel really empowered after that,2013-08,thinking lot term empowerment late

the current debate on paid parental leave offers some interesting perspective on politics and sexism as supporters of the competing models seek traction for their views the basic difference between the two major options on offer is the relationship between the payment and the recipients usual pay labor is proposing one level of payment the minimum wage for all eligible recipients for weeks with no superannuation contribution the coalition and the greens version is salary replacement with a cap for the liberals for the greens with super for weeks the two schemes differ primarily ideologically on whether the payment is a one size fits all welfare payment or a form of replacement for pay lost while on leave why am i publicly supporting the second version which happens to be the model promoted both by tony abbott and the greens my view and those of most feminists is that the wage replacement model is preferable because it reinforces the normalisation of parental leave as a workplace entitlement one of the major problems still faced by mothers and increasingly by some fathers is that the ideal worker is still seen as someone that doesnt have primary responsibility for children that interfere with their availability to employers part of the process if we want to change this damaging workplace culture is to increasingly legitimate connections between paid jobs and unpaid family time needs and responsibilities paid parental leave which is similar to other leave agreements is part of the process of normalising dual roles as employees and human beings so related pay rates becomes part of the pattern a flat rate payment does not make that connection clear and may reinforce the perception that this is basically a welfare payment for the childs well being not a workplace entitlement many of the nastier arguments that have been raised against the income replacement model make this assumption and rage against women being paid differently for having babies this argument shows the danger of the welfare approach as it pitches low income women against high income women inequality of earnings between women should not be the issue here high income women get more holiday pay than low income women and similarly more sick pay if they have the flu so why not more for parental leave there are other factors that can be taken into account in setting the parental leave payment one is that womens life time earnings reduce substantially if they have children time off and reduced pay when returning to work make a substantial difference to retirement income so paying them all or most of their pay when on officially sanctioned leave closes the gap somewhat this again makes the fuss about the higher levels of payment particularly obnoxious would we see the same issue raised were this not a payment mainly for women superannuation is an example of gendered policy as some of tax concessions go to the top of income earners almost all men this is clearly unfair in gender terms but remains an interesting exemption from the gendered criticism raised against this payment high income women who are relatively few become the target of abuse if they receive any form of public assistance which suggests a deeply sexist set of assumptions underpinning these debates as high income men are seen as entitled to tax concessions galore sadly the debate has become mired in a mix of sexism and partisan politics on one side we have those with the questionable archaic view that see no paid parental leave should be ever granted along with neoliberals who are anti

tying knots to build a makeshift raft his face screwed up with concentration and his skinny arms straining with the effort david looks like any other child enjoying a day of outdoor pursuits but this afternoon of fun is far removed from davids normal life the yearold lives with a relative because his father is in jail and his mother is in hospital he does not know which school he is going to in september the charityrun summer camp he is attending like many other summer schemes gives him and thousands of other deprived children respite from that but is under threat as charities churches and social services struggle to cope changes to benefits a growing food crisis and the cutting of youth services have left charities at breaking point says kids companys founder camilla batmanghelidjh who warns that if the government continues to ignore mounting tension in the countrys most deprived areas trouble will explode in innercity ghettos we are already facing a housing crisis we are already facing a food crisis these kids look at this government and think what does the system have to offer us she says they are spoken of as scroungers as feral youth as immigrants who should go home you put this country in a very dangerous position if you abandon this group if you entirely leave them behind they will disturb and upset the good you have built up at the other end of town a fourday break run by kids company in the peak district is the only holiday these children will get this summer and their only chance to escape regular violence abuse and hunger says batmanghelidjh who founded the charity years ago despair is escalating she says these are children living in poverty with no social capital we are seeing schemes for them shut down churches under pressure to feed them and a parent who is so sick they cannot look after themselves you see why it is so important to be able to take them away this summer with the financial support of lancashire insurance and kinmont advisory kids company and fellow charity active communities network are taking disadvantaged london kids on residential camps while kids company has launched an appeal to continue to support those who cannot leave the capital kidscoorguk to continue to support those who cannot leave the capital at bedtime you sometimes discover that they have night terrors or they wet the bed says batmanghelidjh the children often delight in being read to in having a hot drink before they go to bed those normal rituals of childhood are so poignantly powerful and thats why they love these residentials i went in the water it was so sick shouts a dripping wet tyrone about his afternoon paddling around the bushes that surround combs reservoir near edale in derbyshire its wet theres poo everywhere it smells but

there are places with gangs or whatever but here you know it is safe you can go where you want there arent many people just a lot of sheep funding for these summer camps is difficult to come by and getting harder according to batmanghelidjh what this government has managed to do is give people of wealth the excuse not to give she says the austerity narrative is dangerous it has made people feel like they are in the trenches that they can only look after themselves thatcher said there was no such thing as society but in my opinion this government has recreated that legacy by convincing us that we are all so poor we cannot help our neighbours and that we have no responsibility towards them she says funding for the four centres the charity runs in london and bristol which give out about food bags and food vouchers a week is not secure the children on the rafting trip in the peak district are preparing to jump off a jetty in the late afternoon sunshine one of the charitys crisis team says that for david this is the only place he can escape the only place he can get some normality its a chance for him just to have some fun and hopefully to heal when these kids are in london they

female politicians have to work hard to be noticed and seen in the bangontables world of westminster one of david camerons ministers has said lady verma of leicester an energy minister said the way women have to raise our tempo to be heard is an unattractive aspect of politics today in an interview with the guardian the senior tory said the presence of more female politicians has made debate much more tempered but it could still be improved by having more women right at the top of the coalition asked about the biggest barrier to women in politics verma said it was the way we conduct it adding that there are huge obstacles and challenges im not a supporter of the bangontables and be adversarial in politics and i still think that puts a lot of women off she said anywhere where we have to raise our tempo to be noticed and seen i just find unattractive and i think most people generally find that unattractive we spend all our lives telling children not to do it and then we get older go into politics and have to do it her intervention comes at a critical time for female mps and peers as cameron and ed miliband the labour leader are said to be mulling reshuffles that are likely to see more women promoted but in a sign that female elevation remains controversial last week alan duncan a tory development minister warned cameron against promoting token women at the expense of more talented men verma a former businesswoman who started her first company at said female politicians should only be promoted on merit but pointed out there are fabulous women in parliament who deserve top jobs she said cameron absolutely needs more female ministers while praising him for helping to make politics a more diverse pot than before the energy minister speaking after an event on women in green industry said there are similar challenges for female businesswomen and politicians she added that she wanted to see more companies especially big ones offering flexible working now that technology allows people to work from home and different hours however verma said she would also like to see women put themselves forward for difficult jobs be unafraid of failure and try not to be perfectionist she said bringing up a family at the same time as running her company made her realise that she would have to compromise on keeping a perfect house she added weve to got to look at how businesses institutions organise themselves but its also about our selfattitude she said part of the problem is we overanalyse ourselves we have an overexpectation of ourselves as women verma was made a peer in and joined camerons government at the start of the coalition three years ago born in punjab india she moved to britain with her parents aged one she then attended a school that is selfdeemed as one of the worst in leicester before her family stopped her from going to university and she decided to set up a fashion businessi have worked very hard to stand on my own two feet against a backdrop of a community where i come from that was incredibly male dominated into a world of business that was incredibly male dominated into a world of politics again very maledominated she said despite shying away from calling herself a feminist she said her mission in life is to remove obstacles for ambitious women especially those from ethnic minority backgrounds sexism you can deal with it by saying it exists it shant hold me back she said when my father said i couldnt go to university it was my mission to ensure anybody from an ethnic minority community who wanted to should never be stopped although my father passed away being incredibly proud of my achievements and recognising at the end perhaps hed stopped somebody quite bright in her studies from going on ive kept it as a mission that wherever i see obstacles for women i make sure that i help remove them verma said she has objected to quotas forevermore because she would hate to be seen as ticking two boxes as a bme and a woman however the tory minister said she did not retreat from pushing for female equality without being biased towards women she added raising your head above the parapet isnt always a comfortable place,2013-08,female politician work hard noticed seen bangontables world westminster one david camerons minister ha said lady verma leicester energy minister said way woman raise tempo

it has gone pm toothbrushing time the kids and i are pondering how peter capaldi will measure up as the next doctor who as the toothpaste is dispensed i express regret that a woman was not chosen women cant be doctors only men can she would have to be his nurse or assistant they squawk righteously i am horrified did i metaphorically and literally one drunken girls night burn my bra and take a feminist history module in the s only to spawn patriarchal preteens years later in our followup discussion it emerges that the kids know that women can be doctors two of our female friends are gps but admit they made the outlandish statement without thinking so the kids are by instinct sexist yikes covertly i decide to test their feminist credentials what do they know about feminism i ask casually over tea the following day ew not that splutters son syd nine evidently fearing i am about to launch into a sexed chatette did you know i plod on brightly that not so long ago women didnt have any rights they couldnt work rarely got an education and werent even allowed to vote blank bored faces these are the kids who skip around the house chanting divorced beheaded died and love outdoing each other with tudor facts all because of horrible histories i realise i need to give my feminism tutorial a gory sheen to pique their interest one hundred years ago this very year i wibble on in the mock cockney of a london dungeon tour guide poor emily wilding davison ad her skull cracked open by the kings orse so you i waggle a finger menacingly at the girls are equal to him the craggy finger turns to syd there are mumurs of interest i thought it was a train muses one at some point i get on to braburning how it was done as a symbol for womens liberation mery seven listens intently when i finish she appears to gather her thoughts long pause furrow of brow a smile lightbulb popping on in brain mummy she beams i think i know how the great fire of london started molly the eldest at and a feisty extomboy turned guitartoting indie kid is surely a natural homespun feminist just like her ma if women wanted the vote they should have just refused to have sex she says channelling cosmopolitan magazine circa hang on though that wouldnt work because poshos like kate middleton wouldnt care so theyd ignore the sex ban blimey years of me blasting out the angry leftist agitpop of my youth at the kids and lolling on the sofa in front of girlie telly sop has perhaps begot some sort of new shagadelic socialist feminism after all republican sexandthecityism anyone but alas the sutherlands have not escaped the pernicious influences of the maledominated society i dare to ask the kids the ultimate patriarchyometer question whos in charge of the family dad the dog dad and the dog it is apparent that i the benign mothership command less power in the household than the stolid death star that is my husband steve he works in magazines and was editor of nme he has been a figurehead with minions he is smart unerringly capable confident annoyingly alpha i strongly suspect that like a benevolent dictator a nicer mussolini if you will he sees us his family as minionish meanwhile i took years out of work to produce and care for the brood i suffered the disaffection common to the formerly employed new mother turned domestic drudge who was i when would it end wheres the wine and so i nurtured and baked while steve earned and moaned before kids i used to be somebody else i used to play on the wing for camberwell old fallopians womens football club i stuck two fingers up at all the shitty misogyny prevalent in every office i have ever worked in as a production editor at nme i was called a witch for trying to enforce a deadline with the then predominantly male writers i followed politics got angry often and had an opinion that was frequently loudly expressed and now who am i mummy to sexist kids i have spent years mimsying about equipping the kids with reasonably genderneutral clothes and toys but i might as well have dressed the girls like katie price and armed the boy with a kalashnikov our stereotypical gender roles have clearly sown the sexist seed in their little brains witness the doctor comment i realise with mounting despair that it is not just our roles that are enforcing gender sterotypes but our daytoday behaviour dog put dead bird on childs bed who ya gonna call dad mum will scream like a wuss hair needs a nice swingy ponytail wotcha gonna do ask mum baldheaded dad hasnt a clue etcetera what is more research by northern spains university of the basque country has revealed that mums have a greater influence on childrens sexist attitudes than dads it is a nowin situation women are both the biggest victims and perpetrators of sexist crimes as a mum i feel guilty oops another gender stereotype but its not all my fault i have my own parents who did for me philip larkinstyle they fuck you up your mum and dad my scottish exmilitary dad frequently visits our house to do diy jobs and mow the lawn my wee scots mum meanwhile is the best in the world she has a large cosy chest for cuddles and spends all day nurturing and fussing if the menfolk need tea she appears cuppa in hand as if by magic nice as being a teabearer is i resolve to make an effort to conduct myself in a less gendercliched manner for the sake of the children my first test comes after the kids bathtime molly is wrapped in a towel lounging in front of the tv when a giant spider crawls across her lap wahhhhh geritoff she shrieks careful not to reveal my inner anxiety i dont like creepycrawlies i try to coax it on to the nearest thing to hand merys pink plastic watch rather inadvisably i try to slip the watchstrap under the spiders hooves to transport it out of the front door but its so big it scampers off growling then in an extraordinary act of nongendered bravery i grab the spider with my bare hand and lob it out of the door youre my hero mummy squeaks molly in mock toddlerspeak and i do feel heroic and empowered for a brief spider asskicking moment i defeated sexism sort of there is a new wave of feminism right now apparently radio s womans hour is always banging on about it so it must be true but an ism sounds so boringly doctrinal that i worry it will hold no allure for the vajazzled youth of today idle chats are frequently conducted during the longhaul of the summer holidays often about the impending return to school i wish i was a girl during tudor times muses syd sounding his usual fey self during one such conversation then i would never have to go to school mery who adores school drinks in the information that girls were and are still in many places considered less worthy than boys she cannot believe her ears she is known

solidarityisforwhitewomen started in a moment of frustration one of my good friends sydette harry aka blackamazon had been a target of hugo schwyzer in the days before everyone was forced to face the truth about him in the course of a very public twitter meltdown he admitted specifically targeting women of color because they were in his way so to the many people i hurt i am sorry to the women of color i trashed in i am so sorry hugo schwyzer hugoschwyzer august in the days following there has been a curious disavowal of connections to him schwyzer used to be able to rely on gaining exposure from influential feminist bloggers at feministe jezebel and pandagon i am sorry for my former colleagues like jessicavalenti and jillfilipovic who couldnt work with me or bring themselves to denounce me hugo schwyzer hugoschwyzer august digital feminists like jill filipovic also a guardian columnist jessica coen jessica valenti and amanda marcotte were in our view complicit in allowing hugo schwyzer to build a platform which as he has now confessed was based partly on putting down women of color and defending white feminism i have seen the disavowals and people distancing themselves from schwyzer but i have not seen the expressions of regret or condemnation for his impact on blackamazon redlightvoices and the other women of color he has trashed over the years and woc yes you amaditalks and blackamazon you were right i was awful to you because you were in the way hugo schwyzer hugoschwyzer august it appeared that these feminists were once again dismissing women of color woc in favor of a brand of solidarity that centers on the safety and comfort of white women for it to be at the expense of people who were doing the same work was exceptionally aggravating admittedly this isnt a new problem white feminism has argued that gender should trump race since its inception that rhetoric not only erases the experiences of women of color but also alienates many from a movement that claims to want equality for all this is especially clear when posts and articles about racism in feminism from five years ago involve some of the very same players while schwyzer hasnt completely stopped pretending to be a feminist ally it is clear that hes still invested in silencing woc this whole solidarityisforwhitewomen thing is an abusive cudgel to be used against a lot of people who are really working at inclusivity hugo schwyzer hugoschwyzer august and for white feminists to enable him for so long is especially galling when i launched the hashtag solidarityisforwhitewomen i thought it would largely be a discussion between people impacted by the latest bout of problematic behavior from mainstream white feminists it was intended to be twitter shorthand for how often feminists of color are told that the racism they experience isnt a feminist issue the first few tweets reflect the deeply personal impact of such a longrunning structural issue as the hashtag spread across twitter people from all walks of life started joining in to vent their own personal frustrations as well as to address larger political issues feminism as a global movement meant to unite all women has global responsibilities and as illustrated by hundreds of tweets has failed at one of the most basic it has not been welcoming to all women or even their communities many users of the tag commented on how therapeutic it was to voice publicly their issues so in that way it has been healing for some people but many of the same comments that were being decried by people who understood the tags context were repeated by those upset at its existence people who are part of the problem arent learning as much as they should at least not yet but it has been barely hours an honest conversation between feminists about feminism and its future is happening and like every truly honest discussion of differences it has been incredibly contentious hopefully it will also be productive despite the natural brevity encouraged by twitter any conversation that can span a full day must generate some change the only question is whether or not feminism will be receptive to the critiquing and to doing the work required to resolve the problems,2013-08,solidarityisforwhitewomen started moment frustration one good friend sydette harry aka blackamazon target

some children could be forced to help meet the costs of being taken into care under a proposed local authority initiative that immediately came under fire from child protection campaigners the idea to shift social care costs onto parents carers and even children themselves if they are over comes from worcestershire county council which has put the idea out to consultation if carers and children do not comply with the new initiative they could face legal action the local authority has warned certain groups of children will remain exempt from the proposed charging regime which could land youngsters or their carers with bills of up to a year the scheme would affect children placed in voluntary care and the council will still pay for statutory child protection adoption services and for services for young offenders and those involved in antisocial behaviour social workers will be expected to help assess whether parents or children can afford to pay chargeable services include the involvement of a social worker accommodation advice and guidance family support family group conferences and activities outside of the home the council acknowledges the point at which a child becomes accommodated can be quite traumatic and it is recognised that this may be a difficult time to start a financial assessment there are rare cases where parents who can offer their children a home again refuse to do so and this policy also allows us to ask those parents for a contribution towards the cost of their care said siobhan williams head of childrens social care if a family are in crisis they would not be charged for services barnardos and the nspcc said they fear the scheme could deter parents and carers from seeking muchneeded help from the council it has the potential to prevent parents seeking help at the earliest opportunity which will be bad for those children and means their problems will get worse said tom rahilly head of strategy and development for lookedafter children at the nspcc the council said there are very limited cases when it would be considered appropriate to seek a contribution from a young person even where sufficient monies are available to the child the local

my week began like so many others with a message im writing an article on male feminists and wondered if you might be willing to answer a few brief questions i replied as i usually do that im happy to help if i can but on the proviso that i am not a feminist im often called a feminist by others in roughly equal measures as a compliment and an insult and i am happy to take it in the intended spirit either way but it is not how i define myself the very notion of male feminism has never sat comfortably with me and when i began writing and blogging more regularly on gender issues it soon became apparent that it would be a less troublesome for everyone if i did so from outside the feminist tent last week one of the worlds most prominent and controversial male feminists announced he was quitting the internet and would no longer be blogging on feminist issues hugo schwyzer has long been a deeply divisive figure within feminism although his blogs and columns at jezebel the atlantic and even occasionally comment is free had their admirers his troubled personal history made him to many others an entirely inappropriate spokesman for feminism it would be hard to disagree although the venom and persistence with which he was hounded by detractors across the blogosphere was often breathtaking the unfolding news made for sad reading in every way between announcing his online retirement due to breakdowns and his own domestic and marital concerns schwyzer was hospitalised then gave an illadvised interview to new york magazine while on a cocktail of powerful medicines it was a sorry spectacle scarcely improved by the celebratory reactions of some of his critics although i disagreed with him on just about everything and we had more of our share of cross words i wish schwyzer nothing less than a full recovery and the chance to find the peace of mind that has obviously long eluded him in his new york magazine interview schwyzer made a particularly telling remark one i suspect he would have swallowed back had he had a clearer head if you look at the men who are writing about feminism they toe the line very carefully its almost like they take their cues from the women around them ive interacted with him often enough to know that schwyzer has a very dry sense of humour so i suspect there was an element of ironic selfdeprecation at play here but either way he illustrates the key problem facing any highprofile selfidentifying male feminist they absolutely must take their cues from the women around them yield first in disputes and toe the line very carefully the alternative to that was demonstrated with customary perfection by the onion in a piece entitled man finally put in charge of struggling feminist movement one can entirely understand the fury with which feminists greet patronising advice from men about how to do feminism properly feminism is a movement that is to a large extent about challenging societal norms that give men more powerful roles and influential voices many male feminists such as the three michaels kimmel kaufman and flood sidestep this by writing primarily about what men should do among ourselves however as schwyzer correctly identified this can only ever be within the limits set by feminist women the ultimate goal of all feminists male or female is and rightly should be the welfare and social and political emancipation of women if men are concerned about the problems men face not just the problems men cause then the pews of the feminist cathedral are rarely the most comfortable place to sit is it possible for someone to be a bad person but a good feminist if the personal really is political then no probably not however i would hazard that it is much more problematic to be a bad man and a good feminist than to be a bad woman and a good feminist women may be cut some more slack for their personal failings and chequered histories and in the context of the feminist movement that is probably fair in my own life and work i find it hard enough to be a good person without also having to worry about being a good feminist if ever one of those two needs to go it has to be the latter feminism can cope without me im sure and will be all the stronger for doing so,2013-08,week began like many others message im writing article male feminist wondered might willing answer brief question

five applicants for social housing taking part in a realitytv timetravel experiment to be broadcast on monday the threepart channel documentary series benefits britain transports nichola back for one

who felt she had no choice but to end a difficult relationship with her daughters father the harsh treatment of single mothers in the postwar period is not something stuck in the annals of history however a few weeks ago the group a collection of tory mps from the most marginal conservative constituencies called for britains youngest single mothers to be denied social housing as part of a new drive to reduce teen pregnancy this despite the fact that teen pregnancies are at a record low the report was welcomed by david cameron the proposals suggesting that benefits be removed from teenage mothers unless they live with their parents or in supervised hostel accommodation according to gingerbread single parents of whom the vast majority are women form twothirds of all households affected by the governments new benefits cap under the new universal credit system that is gradually replacing income support housing benefit and jobseekers allowance single parents are already worse off children from singleparent families are now twice as likely to live in poverty as those from couple families says gingerbreads chief executive fiona weir because of my own family history i was asked to take part in the documentary and tell nichola on camera what life was like for my mother back in when after being abandoned by my father she gave birth to me in an austere hostel for unmarried mothers its the kind of place that will once more corral and stigmatise todays teenage mums if the group ever gets its way i told her that the experience emotionally damaged my mother for ever she never really recovered from the shame of having to give birth in a hostel that made the mothers pray for forgiveness every day for their sins and march to church like children twice on sundays instead of being a place of refuge the hostel was known locally as the home for naughty girls in channel s tv experiment not only does nichola lose her twobedroom council house she is grilled by an actor playing a prejudiced moral welfare officer who tells her that her mixedrace children tiarna four and sienna two stick out like a sore thumb and will get picked on little wonder that nichola says she found the weeks filming an emotional ordeal it had a real impact on my life im even more clingy with my daughters now nichola spent time in care as a child because of problems with both her parents so its easy to see why preserving the sanctity of her own family unit is so important to her before having children she was doing well at work with a silverservice waitressing award from londons hilton hotel and feels strongly that single mothers should be praised rather than blamed because its such a hard job to raise children on your own executive producer stef wagstaffe explains that when benefit rules were first introduced it was all about conforming the state had no moral imperative to house single mothers who would have been judged as unsuitable they were expected to throw themselves on the mercy of their family or rely on charity from religious organisations a lot of their children were then whisked away into care and then into adoption by nice middleclass childless couples these days our atomised lives throw up much more complex needs than in those postwar years when the extended family usually lived nearby to help out the lone mother it is a fundamental change in our society that politicians conveniently ignore as they seek to impose a onesizefitsall system on benefits claimants wagstaffes researchers found that in some areas the government provided free childcare places to get mothers back to work whereas now for working mothers the cost of childcare is the highest in europe we worked out that in nichola gets an hour on benefits and the minimum wage is then shes got to pay for childcare in order to work explains wagstaffe her cheapest local childcare is an hour for two kids so all of a sudden you understand the benefits trap for so many single mothers i ask wagstaffe herself a single mother if she was worried her programme might even give ideas to the government costcutters she admits that she was concerned until she realised that the coalition government was already ahead of the documentary in denying unsupported teenage mums social housing the benefit reforms rolled out months before we hit the screen they are dialling backwards she says

yesterday the prime minister announced a million dollar commitment to improve before and after school care it was kevin rudds big pitch on the first day of official campaigning and as such it is significant the fund will allow up to schools to provide extended opening hours more places and better activities for the children attending the commitment is formal recognition from the government that combining work and family responsibilities isnt easy but the truth is policies like these are a mixed blessing for parents like me next year my youngest child will start school my employer is desperately keen to have me back fulltime rather than the parttime hours i have worked while having babies i am now separated from the father of my children but he works fulltime too and like so many other australian parents i live in the suburbs and work in the city i have a fairly manageable commute but it still involves car trips train rides and walking consequently our two children will need to be at before and after school care and the thought of new funds providing them with homework club music lessons and supervised sport greatly appeals to me if i can no longer be at home some of the week and the cost of housing seems to prevent one from seriously considering otherwise then i want my kids to get all the educational activities i am not there to give them i love my job but you bet i carry some working mothers guilt the prime ministers announcement included mention that some places may now even be able to open from am to pm great pressure is off well kind of theres an implicit assumption here that where work clashes with family the government intervenes to encourage families to better adapt to the needs of the workplace and not so much the other way around at the very pointy end of adaptation are kids i cant help but think that were expecting rather a lot of them imagine youre the kind of person who finds being around people all day especially noisy active people really quite tiring and imagine you dont relax properly until you are with family and can finally let out some of the emotions youre holding in at least one of my children if not both of them are like this some kids absolutely thrive at before and after school care but on top of a full school day it is exhausting for others kids will survive of course but could we aim for something better than survival in the absence of initiatives offering wider choices for parents government policies focused on enhancing workplace participation reinforce the notion that theres a superior model for families and it is one where parents are working the most hours possible as a feminist i would never deny women the choice of work fact is paid work has likely been the greatest single contributor to gender equality but i am also sceptical that this is the only solution to inequality because we tend not to ask how cities housing transport and workplaces may be organised differently we ask instead how we can keep kids at school longer and make parents more accessible to workplaces in doing so we ignore the fact that dependency in all its many forms is part of being human we also ignore the fact that working outside the home simply wont be possible for some families while i will personally benefit from rudds new initiative it comes at some cost myself and men and women like me who juggle caring responsibilities including elder care child care disability care and self care may find it gets more difficult to negotiate with employers for flexible arrangements policies like this one put the onus on me to be available and not on my employer to be more familyfriendly,2013-08,yesterday prime minister announced million dollar commitment improve school care wa kevin rudd big pitch first

the hardworking family is the kind of easytorecognise but hardtodefine concept that politicians love the chancellor chose hardworking families as the people whod gain most from his childcare voucher scheme which he reannounced on monday and its those families that labour calling for an urgent inquiry fear are being driven into zerohours contracts childcare costs and flexible working go to the heart of the problems that families with young children grapple with but neither offers a solution to the real problem which is this childcare is too often either unaffordable or unavailable or both deal with the strategic problem of the supply of good readily available allyearround care at a price parents can afford and most working families would immediately feel much better off the way britain pays for childcare a mix of universal and incomerelated support and employer contributions is a costly mess where relatively small alterations in circumstance can dramatically affect affordability so is what is provided three and fouryearolds are guaranteed hours of nursery care soon the poorest of twoyearolds will be eligible too meanwhile the share of a familys earnings spent on childcare fell steadily in the labour years to a low of only to start climbing again under coalition changes to entitlement yet this patchy arrangement is also according to the oecds most recent figures expensive partly because the cost of putting all fiveyearolds into school is included without necessarily being highquality according to the family and childcare trust the shortage of places has pushed the average price per child of schoolholiday care above a week helpfully the fct has also been analysing different systems of supporting childcare it finds the method that produces the best value for money is one where local authorities have a budget to support childcare in both the public and private sectors providers have to meet stringent standards and parents pay a meanstested fee but instead of looking for a better way of doing childcare the coalition tried first to cut its cost by increasing the ratio of children to carer and now proposes a complicated system of online vouchers that will be available to parents with a household income of up to any system based on taxpayers unavoidably fails the poorest working families who dont pay tax the resolution foundation reckons it will help just of lower earners against m of higher earners and while welcome changes to universal credit will also go to taxpayers cutting out nearly a million other working families another response to the lack of availability of childcare and the complexity of paying for it is for parents to work flexibly and care for their children themselves its the argument wheeled out by the defenders of zerohours contracts which were once unknown but now cover an estimated m working people maybe more since many dont recognise that is what their terms and conditions amount to plainly there are times when zerohours contracts make sense to everyone there isnt going to be regular demand for say servers of baked potatoes at outdoor events but even students living at home get frustrated when work theyd anticipated isnt there it is unacceptable to ask people who provide home help week in week out and who are already barely earning the minimum wage to work between and hours at the convenience of their employer an invidious erosion of workers rights is seeping through the labour market from privatised domiciliary workers to lecturers in universities from cleaners in hospitals to buckingham palace guides and hansard shorthand writers it privileges employers while intimidating employees but until parents have affordable reliable childcare its a familiar compromise either they worry about whos looking after their children and how to pay them or they take a job that offers few benefits and no security,2013-08,hardworking family kind easytorecognise hardtodefine concept politician love

parents will be eligible for new taxfree childcare support worth a year under a scheme outlined by the treasury on monday at the moment the scheme is still being designed and parents have been invited to comment on the proposals here we look at what it will mean for families how will the scheme work from autumn parents will be able to buy vouchers online to pay for childcare for every p they spend the government will add p the scheme is available for up to of childcare costs per child each year the parent will pay while the government gives a subsidy the vouchers can only be used to pay for ofstedregulated childcare so not for care provided by friends or relatives the government claims the cap exceeds the average cost for hours of childcare for a child under two how old do my children have to be for me to qualify initially the scheme will only cover childcare for the underfives and for disabled children aged up to but it will eventually be extended to include children up to the age of the age limit will be increased each year so in the second year children aged up to six will qualify in the third year children aged up to seven and so on if your child was born after the autumn of you should qualify how many children can i claim for the treasury says the scheme will be available for each child aged up to there doesnt seem to be a limit on the number of children can i claim even if i am a taxpayer yes although many higher rate taxpayers have been hit by the child benefit changes that mean payments are clawed back if one parent earns more than a year in this scheme they qualify for the same amount of government help as lower earners one of the controversial aspects of the scheme is that it will be available to all parents earning up to when the tax rate kicks in this means the government will be subsidising childcare for couples earning up to between them how about if i receive other benefits parents who receive support through tax credits or later the universal credit will not be able to use the vouchers instead the government will meet of the costs of childcare for parents on universal credit provided that both parents are working and earn more than the personal tax allowance which is due to reach by my partner doesnt work do we still qualify not unless they are a carer and receive carers allowance or they receive contributory employment and support allowance where this isnt the case in a couple both parents have to be working in order for the family to qualify in singleparent families the lone parent must have a job this is different from the current voucher scheme where help can be claimed even if only one of two parents is employed what if i take maternity leave if you qualify for the scheme before taking maternity or paternity leave or any other kind of paid parental leave you will continue to be eligible while you are not working is this worse than the existing voucher scheme the voucher scheme or employer supported childcare scheme allows parents to sacrifice part of their salary in exchange for childcare vouchers effectively this means they are paying for part of their childcare taxfree the vouchers are worth up to a week or a month the saving in tax and national insurance contributions adds up to a year because both parents can claim the total saving can be almost a year this is regardless of how many children you have so it looks better for singlechild families but worse for those with more children the scheme is only offered by around of employers and can be quite complex the government says just families claim it while the new scheme will eventually reach million households will the voucher scheme stop not entirely if you are a member and want to continue to use the scheme until your child reaches you can but only if you stay with the same employer workers can continue to sign up until the new scheme is introduced but it will be phased out and the cash diverted to supporting the new policy this means that eventually there will be no support for parents of children aged between and except where the child is disabled in that case support will continue until they turn parents will not be able to claim vouchers under both systems at the same time so you will need to make a choice how do i have my say if you want to comment on the proposals you can respond to a questionnaire which is running online until september the survey asks about the practicalities of operating the scheme and how you think you might use it as well as giving you chance to comment on the terms and conditions the

ministers hope to assuage critics of the governments plan for childcare vouchers by extending the taxfree scheme to parents who stay at home because they are carers and to parents on maternity or paternity leave the government hopes the two concessions to be announced on monday will do something to see off critics who claim the new vouchers punish families where one parent stays at home in march it was announced that the voucher would only be available to households where both parents are at work prompting criticism that the government was punishing stayathome parents the preschool learning alliance said the plans were unfair and that they flew in the face of the preelection rhetoric to help mothers who stayed at home neil leitch chief executive of the alliance said to offer this money to a couple whose dual earnings could reach but not to a couple earning a fraction of this amount who choose to have one parent stay at home seems perverse this seems to be more about dangling a carrot to tempt mums back to work rather than providing real childcare choices the treasury claims such criticism is a misunderstanding of the scheme which is aimed at reducing costs of childcare so that it becomes financially more worthwhile for more parents to go to work or to stay in work extortionate childcare costs are often cited as one of the chief reasons why both parents do not go to work the changes are to be announced as part of a threemonth consultation launched on monday on the childcare package designed eventually to help with the childcare costs of children aged up to any family where both parents are in work and each is earning less than will be eligible the scheme will take many years to be fully operational since it will be phased in from autumn families with children aged under five are initially covered the payment will start at the beginning of the school year and will eventually cover million working families the scheme could save a typical family with two children aged under up to a year the average cost of a parttime nursery place for a child under two in the uk is now more than per year or an hour ministers say they want feedback from parents for their plans a simple online version of the week consultation has been prepared for parents by the treasury a recent coalition consultation on childcare over relaxing the ratios between children and nursery staff ended disastrously for the conservatives as the liberal democrats withdrew support for the plan citing a parent backlash during the consultation some conservatives blamed the organisation mumsnet for orchestrating the opposition and the treasury is trying to organise this consultation so parents respond directly to the treasury a move possibly intended to reduce the influence of lobbying groups george osborne who is due to visit a nursery on monday said this government is on the side of people who want to work hard and get on in life taxfree childcare will help working parents by giving them more choice and better access to the quality affordable childcare they need we want to make the new scheme work in the way that is best for parents so today we are asking for their views and id like as many parents as possible to tell us what they think under the scheme parents will be able to open an online voucher account with a provider and have their payments topped up by the government the vouchers can then be redeemed against childcare from any ofstedregistered provider the new regime will mean the phasing out of the employerbacked childcare system at present about of employers opt in covering around households parents can pay directly for some childcare out of their gross annual wage giving relief from income tax and national insurance costs nick clegg has been attacked about the impact of the proposals on stay at home mothers on his weekly lbc radio phonein laura perrins a barrister told the deputy prime minister im just wondering why the coalition is discriminating against mothers like me who care for their children at home you probably think what i do is a worthless clegg pointed to the help that the government was already giving with childcare including hours of free preschool support given to of the most disadvantaged two year olds he defended the eligibility of the voucher scheme arguing what we are saying is that

those under by under current plans the scheme was first announced in march but ministers appear subsequently to have failed to find a way to make the scheme available to households where one parent is not working as a result the resolution foundation thinktank warned the scheme would be skewed heavily against the poor unless it was redrafted they warn it will offer very little incentive to work except very specific exceptions for those earning the minimum wage the treasury has said the scheme will be available to up to million working families across the uk it argues the scheme is targeted

the psychiatrist the late anthony clare in a book published at the beginning of the st century on men concluded that it was makeorbreak time for his gender he pondered on the waning of the y referring to the genes on the chromosome that trigger the development of male characteristics and the key to maleness men were seeing their patriarchal empire crumble even as they still held power in all the positions that really count signs of female subversion were everywhere the choice was stark professor clare argued phallic man could capitulate put his macho aggressive selfdestructive controlling driven persona away and let his new emotional recalibrated self out of the closet or face a long slow and painful demise depressed dependent and in need of help it wasnt the kind of book that would have appealed to john wayne what prof clare didnt include in his arguments was a consideration of how capitalism or more precisely its failings might speed up the process and how hard some men unwilling or unable to give up the badge of superiority and the weird comfort of misogyny would retaliate and not just in characters how much longer will we go on putting up with a situation where men pay us back what they owe to mother asked the french psychologist christiane olivier trying to unravel the knots of some mens hatred towards women while it may be useful psychostyle to blame what mummy did or failed to do resentment of womens continuing efforts to break the chains according to prof clare and many others is also fuelled by the binary view that if the socalled weaker sex do well men must do badly in truth the news that a third of women are now the main breadwinner earning more is neither a victory nor a loss in the spurious battle of the sexes a harder look at the terrain of work and home reveals how many of us are progressing neither forward or backward in a linear way instead we are lost in a maze male and female united in the battle for financial survival with a mounting number of casualties on all sides according to a report published earlier this year by the charity the fawcett society one million women are missing from the uk workplace at a loss to the economy that is estimated at bn to bn a year by the former womens minister theresa may they are missing because of the perennial challenges a lack of affordable childcare and the absence of genuinely flexible working that doesnt also require an individual to forfeit a career trajectory women are also further handicapped by the low pay associated with traditional female occupations such as the provision of care and unequal pay economists francine blau and lawrence kahn have analysed the continuing pay gap and after allowing for issues such as job segregation and career breaks they find is unexplainable ie down to plain oldfashioned discrimination so to put the rise of the female breadwinner into context some women are earning well in a labour market that still is fashioned as if everyone has a wife at home other women are the main breadwinners because there is no man many more females are stuck in the shallows twothirds of those on low pay are female doing two and even three parttime jobs to make the unyielding system work better ahead lie even larger rocks according to fawcett of job losses are still to come hitting the public sector hard where females dominate and which pays over more an hour than the private sector to which they are allegedly being redirected for women then theres the churn and change the issues of fair pay and equality the struggle to balance a private life with the demands of the job market throw in too the challenge of what it means to be a good enough parent given what economist heather boushey calls the shiphassailed reality that only

be aired a mens movement seems too naff mens studies too arcane radio s mens hour too selfconscious theres no online dadsnet or public space amenable to lads where discussion and debate is underway about which bits of the old man are being jettisoned and which refashioned and why as prof clare once advocated in the developing world traditional masculinity supported in some instances by religion is making its last stand but what about here we cant leave change to osmosis since its selfawareness that accelerates the positive and works faster to eliminate the negative clare in his effort to

more women than ever are the main breadwinners in their families according to new research for a report entitled the condition of britain two million working mothers are the biggest earners in their families a rise of in the last years in nearly a third of couples with children the mother is a breadwinner defined by the report from the ippr thinktank as earning as much as or more than her partner the report shows that maternal breadwinning has increased for all family types all age groups and across all income groups over the past years the proportion of mothers in couples who are breadwinners has risen from to while the employment rate of lone mothers has increased from to maternal breadwinning among to yearolds including where the mother is the sole earner or only parent has increased from to more than a third of mothers with a degree are breadwinners an increase from and a quarter of mothers without degrees are now breadwinners compared with less than dalia bengalim associate director at ippr said the findings should push the government to do more to tackle the gender pay gap a study published earlier this year on the salaries of new graduates found that women who had just completed their degrees were consistently paid at the lower end of the salary range taking home between and compared with the or more earned by men bengalim said the balance between breadwinning and caring has changed it can no longer be assumed that the dad is the primary breadwinner in a couple as womens employment outside the home rises dualearner couples are more common most families need two earners simply to make ends meet a rise in the employment rate of lone parents means mothers in this position provide the sole income for their family but despite more mothers than ever before being the primary breadwinners many mums still face significant barriers to entering and remaining in work these include a lack of flexible work opportunities the high cost of childcare and parental leave entitlement that is focused on mothers the report finds a wide regional disparity in the number of families where women earn more or the same as their partners families rely most heavily on mums for income in scotland wales and the north of england scotland has the highest level of maternal breadwinning at with in wales the northeast and the northwest this compares with just in the east of england and the southwest and in london and the southeast the report says this is because of the decline in manufacturing which has led to more men being out of work in certain areas in the northeast

lizzie we are seen as the failure family because my husband does not work i became the principal earner because of unemployment at first then habit then illness my partner has now accepted the situation but in the early days there was a definite resentment regarding how much i was rewarded for my work compared to his perception of the value of what he did i think that my children dont regard their father as successful because he hasnt followed a traditional career path they dont always pay attention to him when he talks about working hard ambition and studying because they dont see him doing this himself he always made it clear that he would do childcare but not housework now the children are in their late teens this has improved but i still feel housework falls to me we are seen by our wider families as the failure family because my husband does not work i have been very successful in my career and achieved a great deal but this is not regarded as good enough or even particularly interesting all their focus is on why he doesnt work and what we are going to do about it i find it infuriating it makes me feel that my efforts are worthless cath i am torn between being a proper mum and being a professional when i was due to return from maternity leave my husband and i decided that he would give up work to look after our first daughter as my net earnings were higher we looked into childcare but wanted to take care of our baby ourselves which meant one of us giving up work i think my nineyearold is quite proud of me going to work and helping people but she also wants me to be around more like her friends mums i often feel torn between being a proper mum and doing the best for my children and being a professional and doing the best for the charity i work for to be honest i feel overwhelmed and worn out a dad however good is not mum i feel tired and stuck in a situation i cant change because my husband hasnt worked fulltime for some years and developed a career he couldnt return to work and earn the same as me we barely manage on what i earn and cant downsize i would like to work fewer hours to be there more for the children but i have no way out i have to keep on working fulltime at a senior level just to provide for the essentials and try to eat away at the overdraft i never envisaged that this would be a permanent arrangement other mothers of young children should be aware it is a very difficult situation to cope with aisha i was jealous of the extra time my husband spent with our daughter i became the sole earner by default while my husband was out of work although he has found it difficult to handle not bringing any money home he is proud of my career and thankful i have remained employed our daughter has really benefited from her dad being around more i can really see the stronger bond they have formed while he has been doing more childcare and having the chance for regular oneonone time with her being the sole earner particularly during a challenging time at work really heaped the pressure on and actually made me feel very dispirited for a while i was the only one with an income yet was not enjoying my work but i had no choice but to grit my teeth and get on with it i felt bad complaining to my husband when he wanted nothing more than to be in work himself of course i was pleased to be supporting the family and happy that they were bonding but i was jealous of all the extra time he could spend with our daughter i would rather have been working parttime and enjoying the toddler years more vicky my son gets to spend time with a loving parent and i can continue with my training ive earned more than my husband since we met he is very supportive of my work and proud of me although i think he is sometimes frustrated that we are not in a position for me to be a stayathome parent in september i will leave my sixmonthold baby in the care of his father and go back to work fulltime im a childrens doctor and will be working in paediatric intensive care doing runs of hour shifts looking after desperately ill children the irony of leaving my child to look after other peoples is not lost on me i will be sad to be apart from my son intensely jealous of my husbands time with him and nervous as to how it will work out but realistically this is our best option i am the major earner for our family and this way my husband can take advantage of relatively new legislation allowing him to use the maternity leave i havent taken my son gets to spend time with a loving parent in his own home and i can continue with my training the shift system i work means i will see more of my baby than if i worked however what we are doing is considered at best groundbreaking and at worst abnormal given the grimaces and occasional patronising responses we encounter how i wish we were scandinavian sian it made me feel like a feminist role model until now ive always been the sole earner in my relationships it wasnt planned i just married a man who never got around to getting a job still it appealed to my selfesteem and made me feel like a proper feminist role model it was only when i got divorced and my ex used it against me in the quest for child custody that anyone even pointed out that there were downsides i always assumed that he was happy with the cushy arrangement but now i realise that the resentment was crushing it wasnt just that he couldnt be bothered to work i was simply far better at the gettingajobhavingacareer thing eventually i had to stand in court and explain why having to support my family did not make me a bad mother and so it came out that my inlaws fellow schoolrun mums and even my parents resented me for it too apparently the only people unaffected were the very children i was now forced to fight for even the child support agency offered my unemployed exhusband part of my salary prorata if he could just get custody of our children for more nights per week than me these days im the minor earner in one of those unfashionable relationships with a straight conventionally attractive highearning man and its been a bit of a shock if i earn less will my work be given less priority so ill continue to earn less am i still a feminist some names have been changed,2013-08,lizzie seen failure family husband doe work became principal earner unemployment first

sweeping reforms to a system previously too encumbered by red tape have resulted in a surge in the number of adoptions to a year high with almost children finding permanent homes in the past months the placements of older children and mixedrace youngsters have seen a particularly sharp rise and that is very welcome much of the credit for this improvement must lie with sir martin narey former head of barnardos appointed ministerial adviser on adoption in his report published in the same year proposed among other measures a score card for local authorities with the goal of ensuring that the placement of a child from care to an appropriate family should take place within months the average time continues to be two years and seven months during which period a child sadly may be moved between care homes or foster families critics of the narey reforms rightly voiced concerns that speed may damage the tricky process of matching child and family and underplay the importance of acknowledging the cultural religious and ethnic elements that contribute to a childs identity it is estimated that an average of one in four placements breaks down rising to one in two for older children concerns have also been raised that in cases of domestic violence for instance children are too speedily put up for adoption while grandparents and relatives may be overlooked in the rush to find alternative suitable new parents other challenges remain social workers point out that it is not they who cause the delay but the courts however a good beginning has been made not least in the recently announced m adoption fund to give support to families adoption involves a gruelling selection process for wouldbe parents it is a small miracle that a growing number are willing to open their arms and hearts and give a child the promise of a happier future,2013-09,sweeping reform system previously encumbered red tape resulted surge number adoption year high almost child finding permanent home past month placement older child mixedrace youngster seen particularly sharp rise welcome much credit improvement must lie sir martin narey former head barnardos appointed ministerial adviser adoption report published year proposed among measure score card local authority goal ensuring placement child care appropriate family take place within month average time continues two year seven month period child sadly may moved care home foster family critic narey reform rightly voiced concern speed may damage tricky process matching child family underplay importance acknowledging cultural religious ethnic element contribute child identity estimated average one four placement break rising one two older child concern also raised case domestic violence instance child speedily put adoption grandparent relative may overlooked rush find alternative suitable new parent challenge remain social worker point cause delay court however good beginning ha made least recently announced adoption fund give support family adoption involves gruelling selection process wouldbe parent small miracle growing number willing open arm heart give child promise happier future,"['sweeping', 'reform', 'system', 'previously', 'encumbered', 'red', 'tape', 'resulted', 'surge', 'number', 'adoption', 'year', 'high', 'almost', 'child', 'finding', 'permanent', 'home', 'past', 'month', 'placement', 'older', 'child', 'mixedrace', 'youngster', 'seen', 'particularly', 'sharp', 'rise', 'welcome', 'much', 'credit', 'improvement', 'must', 'lie', 'sir', 'martin', 'narey', 'former', 'head', 'barnardos', 'appointed', 'ministerial', 'adviser', 'adoption', 'report', 'published', 'year', 'proposed', 'among', 'measure', 'score', 'card', 'local', 'authority', 'goal', 'ensuring', 'placement', 'child', 'care', 'appropriate', 'family', 'take', 'place', 'within', 'month', 'average', 'time', 'continues', 'two', 'year', 'seven', 'month', 'period', 'child', 'sadly', 'may', 'moved', 'care', 'home', 'foster', 'family', 'critic', 'narey', 'reform', 'rightly', 'voiced', 'concern', 'speed', 'may', 'damage', 'tricky', 'process', 'matching', 'child', 'family', 'underplay', 'importance', 'acknowledging', 'cultural', 'religious', 'ethnic', 'element', 'contribute', 'child', 'identity', 'estimated', 'average', 'one', 'four', 'placement', 'break', 'rising', 'one', 'two', 'older', 'child', 'concern', 'also', 'raised', 'case', 'domestic', 'violence', 'instance', 'child', 'speedily', 'put', 'adoption', 'grandparent', 'relative', 'may', 'overlooked', 'rush', 'find', 'alternative', 'suitable', 'new', 'parent', 'challenge', 'remain', 'social', 'worker', 'point', 'cause', 'delay', 'court', 'however', 'good', 'beginning', 'ha', 'made', 'least', 'recently', 'announced', 'adoption', 'fund', 'give', 'support', 'family', 'adoption', 'involves', 'gruelling', 'selection', 'process', 'wouldbe', 'parent', 'small', 'miracle', 'growing', 'number', 'willing', 'open', 'arm', 'heart', 'give', 'child', 'promise', 'happier', 'future']",17
thousands of families who were warned they could lose some of their child benefit because of a clampdown may be in the clear after all the current advertising campaign from hm revenue amp customs emphasises that any parent earning more than will have to pay back some or all of their child benefit through the tax system following the introduction of rules earlier in the year but there are likely to be quite a number of parents earning more than this perhaps or who unbeknown to them can continue to claim child benefit without having it clawed back later thats because they dont realise that for the purposes of this new regime they can deduct the money they contribute to their pension from their headline salary in many cases this will be several thousand pounds per year which may be enough to take them below the vital threshold going forward meanwhile many parents will be able to avoid the new tax and still receive child benefit by paying more into their pension around million families are affected by what some claimed was a new tax on children officially known as the high income child benefit charge it took effect on january in a nutshell this means these people can choose to carry on receiving child benefit but will have to pay extra tax and also fill in a tax return if they dont already the extra tax will cancel out some or all of their child benefit which is currently worth a year for a family with two children so far more than people have opted to give up their child benefit so they dont have to pay the extra tax the rest have been continuing to receive the money though some of them will have been unaware of the gathering storm clouds or have chosen to ignore them but hmrc is now reminding them that if they havent already they must register for selfassessment by october or risk being hit with a penalty so how do the new rules work who is affected and what can they do to entirely legally of course get out of paying the extra tax you receive child benefit if youre responsible for a child under or under if they stay in approved education or training however the government has introduced a system where the benefit is withdrawn gradually for those with an income above the tax charge is of the amount of child benefit for each of income between and for those earning more than the charge is of the amount of child benefit so they will in effect get nothing for a family with two children where one parent has an income of their total child benefit is a year you get a week for the eldestonly child then a week for each additional child their tax charge would be of which is if that parents income was the tax charge would be for the full things are complicated by the fact that the new rules came in on january just three months before the end of the tax year on april so for a family with two children the maximum tax charge they face for is for our family with two children where one person earns the extra tax is the really important thing is that what you might think of as an income of a year isnt the same as the taxmans definition the child benefit tax charge is based on your adjusted net income this is your total taxable income ie basic salary plus any benefits such as a company car or private medical insurance plus any savings dividend or rental income minus things such as pension contributions and charitable giving some people who do the maths will find that while their basic salary is more than once they lop off their pension contributions their adjusted net income is actually less than that and they are therefore not affected by the new rules hmrc has a guide to working out your adjusted net income but you would need to be an accountant to get your head around it its best to explain it with an example so here is one hmrc produced based on a simple scenario we gave them mr smith earns has no other income and pays a month into his company pension scheme which he tops up with a further a month of additional voluntary contributions avcs in other words he pays a year in to his pension he needs to deduct that figure from his salary giving him an adjusted net income of that is of course below the crucial so therefore he isnt affected by the new rules even though he assumed he was going forward there are some fairly simple ways for people to reduce their extra tax bill or even escape it the most obvious if you can afford it is to pay more into your pension its not just accountants advising this citizens advice endorses it on its website which says you may be able to avoid having to pay the extra tax and still receive child benefit by reducing your taxable income for example you could do this by paying more into your pension pension contributions are taken out of your income before you pay tax this could therefore reduce the amount of income on which you have to pay tax to below it adds you could also consider using salary sacrifice and opt to have some of your pay paid in the form of childcare vouchers childcare vouchers are also taken out of your income before you pay tax so your taxable income will also reduce another option is to buy extra holiday from your employer via salary sacrifice for example someone earning might have taken off their gross salary for one extra weeks holiday even better you could increase your charitable giving when calculating your adjusted net income if you made a gift aid donation you take off the grossed up amount ie what you donated plus the basic rate of tax so for every of gift aid donations you made take from your net income of the million families affected by the new rules most have either opted out of child benefit were already getting a tax return or have registered for selfassessment leaving about who need to act by october when you register youll be sent a tax form for the deadline to complete your return is october for a paper return or january to file online if you miss next weekends deadline for registering you could face a penalty of up to of the tax due,2013-09,thousand family warned could lose child benefit clampdown may clear current advertising campaign hm revenue amp custom emphasis parent earning pay back child benefit tax system following introduction rule earlier year likely quite number parent earning perhaps unbeknown continue claim child benefit without clawed back later thats dont realise purpose new regime deduct money contribute pension headline salary many case several thousand pound per year may enough take vital threshold going forward meanwhile many parent able avoid new tax still receive child benefit paying pension around million family affected claimed wa new tax child officially known high income child benefit charge took effect january nutshell mean people choose carry receiving child benefit pay extra tax also fill tax return dont already extra tax cancel child benefit currently worth year family two child far people opted give child benefit dont pay extra tax rest continuing receive money though unaware gathering storm cloud chosen ignore hmrc reminding havent already must register selfassessment october risk hit penalty new rule work affected entirely legally course get paying extra tax receive child benefit youre responsible child stay approved education training however government ha introduced system benefit withdrawn gradually income tax charge amount child benefit income earning charge amount child benefit effect get nothing family two child one parent ha income total child benefit year get week eldestonly child week additional child tax charge would parent income wa tax charge would full thing complicated fact new rule came january three month end tax year april family two child maximum tax charge face family two child one person earns extra tax really important thing might think income year isnt taxman definition child benefit tax charge based adjusted net income total taxable income ie basic salary plus benefit company car private medical insurance plus saving dividend rental income minus thing pension contribution charitable giving people math find basic salary lop pension contribution adjusted net income actually less therefore affected new rule hmrc ha guide working adjusted net income would need accountant get head around best explain example one hmrc produced based simple scenario gave mr smith earns ha income pay month company pension scheme top month additional voluntary contribution avcs word pay year pension need deduct figure salary giving adjusted net income course crucial therefore isnt affected new rule even though assumed wa going forward fairly simple way people reduce extra tax bill even escape obvious afford pay pension accountant advising citizen advice endorses website say may able avoid pay extra tax still receive child benefit reducing taxable income example could paying pension pension contribution taken income pay tax could therefore reduce amount income pay tax add could also consider using salary sacrifice opt pay paid form childcare voucher childcare voucher also taken income pay tax taxable income also reduce another option buy extra holiday employer via salary sacrifice example someone earning might taken gross salary one extra week holiday even better could increase charitable giving calculating adjusted net income made gift aid donation take grossed

explained that hes not interested in teaching books by women according to gilmour he only teaches the best i dont love women writers enough to teach them he explains if you want women writers go down the hall what i teach is guys serious heterosexual guys if youre planning to read gilmours apology interview to restore your faith in north american university culture dont he vilifies keeler as a young woman who kind of wanted to make a little name for herself or something in response hazlitt made a full transcript of the interview available also he explains that he wouldnt usually apologise but his publisher is afraid the sexist remarks might affect sales of his current book hey gilmour any places left on your crap apologies course this story has affected me for two reasons first ive just moved to canada to take up a university post and im in the process of devising new curriculums even with a gender consciousness thats alive and kicking and screaming and stamping im finding it hard to achieve anything resembling gender balance in my courses with something like an introduction to irish theatre this is understandable i need to teach the canon the canon is largely historical and women writers were systematically written out but things are changing now right contemporary women writers are valued equally and the bodies of respected work that emerge from our enlightened era will be representative of this right wrong im struggling to include womens voices on the contemporary irish theatre course im devising for next year because the vast majority of celebrated living irish playwrights are male speaking to colleagues in other disciplines similar pictures emerge the second reason im finding this story affecting is internet dating yes internet dating im new in town and ive joined a site for the first time having indulged in outrageous fanfaronade on my profile page and started shopping for mates i noticed that hardly any of the other singletons on sale male or female listed fiction by women in their favourite books section were they afraid theyd catch pregnancy or menopause from female writers or something i changed my profile to stipulate that i only wanted to hear from people who read books by women then something weird happened people started messaging me about their relationships with gender and literature like lots of people the messages ranged from good the person who wrote to say that theyd changed their profile to honour female authors to bad the person who listed six male writers on their page but explained they didnt define themselves around literature to ugly the person who said i like motorcycles but i dont expect you to like motorcycles why do i have to like books by women answer because motorcycles are not one half of the human race people wrote to tell me that in spite of their all male book lists they didnt discriminate when assessing literature these were just the books that they personally liked best ergo i was being judgmental i could have ignored them but my pedagogical urges are just too strong i found myself explaining that of course i didnt imagine anyone was thinking screw those silly scribbling bitches they cant teach me nothing yo when filling out online dating profiles i explained that we live in a society that teaches people to value male thought art and leadership above female thought art and leadership i explained the difference between active and passive discrimination four people wrote to ask for book recommendations i looked at their profiles scoped what other fiction they were into and suggested titles so now im spending my free time creating gender conscious reading lists for strangers on the internet all i wanted was a date my cyber adventures are teaching me that faith in narratives of progress and meritocracy has dulled peoples abilities to perceive sexism in literary culture we need to flag prejudice not ignore it the canons of our time are not going to represent diverse voices unless we consciously intervene when people like gilmour tell us that they dont respect literature by women we need to be brave enough to call this what it is not personal preference or taste but sexism whether active or passive it is discrimination we need to educate to honour the female writers that we love and share their work thats why no matter how much extra time it takes nor how much art i need to pull from the fringes im creating a gender balanced contemporary irish theatre course its also why this weekend im giving a stranger the poisonwood bible on our first

its been a bad week for sexism it is testament to the sheer heady heights to which sexism has soared this week that the decision by amazon and ebay to sell tshirts with slogans such as sometimes no means yes and the rapist under the helpful description funny retro rude hasnt even made it into this article nor has the news that a new york woman is ploughing her way through the task of making sandwiches so her boyfriend will present her with an engagement ring sexism retro if only dashing any remote hope we might have had that sexism was indeed a thing of the past this week author and university of toronto professor david gilmour blithely announced to an interviewer that hes simply not interested in teaching books by women incredibly generously he made an exception for a single short story by virginia woolf the only writer that interests me as a woman writer thanks david and he wasnt done there gay writers too are apparently axed from gilmours academic canon because what i teach is guys serious heterosexual guys f scott fitzgerald chekhov tolstoy real guyguys you cant help but wonder at the irony of the fact that within the very same interview gilmour waxes lyrical about chekhov one of his favourite writers for being so gracious so generous in his dealings with people gilmour hardly emulates his heros grace by writing off all female and gay authors ever to have put pen to paper in a single magnanimous swoop but the real damage in gilmours apparently offhand remarks isnt to the authors themselves hilary mantel zadie smith and toni morrison seem to be soldiering on remarkably bravely despite his inattentions but to the students in his class its like the damage done when boris johnson recently joked that women only go to university to find husbands or when the conductor vasily petrenko claimed men will always be superior conductors because orchestras are distracted by a cute girl on a podium and when eminent artist georg baselitz declared women dont paint very well its a fact the real damage is done to the young aspiring female authors or academics musicians or artists looking to their heroes for inspiration and seeing the door clearly and unequivocally slammed in their faces each instance seems almost utterly preposterous in isolation but for all four of these incidents to have occurred within the space of the past year alone reveals the sad truth that we are still fighting in simply for it to be acknowledged that women are even capable of achieving greatness across a wide variety of fields were not even talking about cracking the glass ceiling here just about being so incredibly lucky as to be allowed to imagine that it is possible what kind of a message does it send to a young woman already wrestling with the reality of a world in which she will face unequal employment opportunities unequal pay unequal expectations for childcare responsibilities to be flatly told that she neednt bother because she wont be good enough as gilmour himself suggests in his praise of chekhov the greatest artists and thinkers have a responsibility and an opportunity to inspire greatness in others what hope is there that gilmours female students will be similarly inspired to damn others aspirations before they have even taken flight is a deeply shameful abuse of that responsibility sadly the horrors of the week didnt end there next up was the publication of a book about how to achieve a successful marriage called love italian style by melissa gorga star of reality show real housewives of new jersey according to extracts published by jezebel the book sees gorga repeatedly advocate deference and submission to your husband both domestically and sexually in the beginning joe wanted to have sex every single day at least once if not twice or three times if i didnt give it to him once a day hed get upset i can do something that pisses him off on a monday but if we had sex on sunday night it blows over more easily but if we havent done it for two days and i give him attitude it could be a huge fight the quotes are worryingly reminiscent of controlling abusive relationships his style was to make corrections and to teach me from the beginning days of our marriage exactly how he envisioned our life together joe always says you got to teach someone to walk straight on the knife if you slip youre going to get cut even if something didnt bother him that badly hed bring it up he wanted to make sure that i knew for example if i ran out to cvs and he came home from work to an empty house he didnt like it worst of all the book contains a section penned by her husband joe including this advice men i know you think your woman isnt the type who wants to be taken but trust me she is every girl wants to get her hair pulled once in a while if your wife says no turn her around and rip her clothes off she wants to be dominated rape joe no trust me no woman wants that with twitter followers and a hit tv show gorga

its the sort of question you would think a prime minister might be prepared for giving a preconference interview to a womens magazine in an attempt to better connect with female voters are you a feminist and yet it left david cameron seemingly flummoxed being quizzed by red magazine cameron paused for some time and sidestepped the issue he replied i dont know what id call myself its up to others to attach labels but i believe that men and women should be treated equally he added and there has been an historic disadvantage that women have faced which governments need to help correct and i think thats what weve been doing even this answer which some might argue sounds like someone espousing feminism while seeking to avoid the label took some effort in a blog interviewer jane johnson noted so i ask him straight is he a feminist he pauses and stares out of the window for what seems like a long time cameron thus joins the long line of politicians found to be fully fluent in complex policy detail only to be caught out by something seemingly simple that said his pause before answering was nowhere near as long as gordon browns famous hour delay before revealing what sort of biscuit he likes anything with a bit of chocolate its arguably little surprise to see cameron struggle with feminism given his mixed record with female voters with a poll this month finding him by some distance the party leader seen as most out of touch with women one issue has been the occasional glimpse of an apparently patronising attitude to women notably the call in parliament to the labour mp angela eagle to calm down dear in the red interview cameron explained this as a joke gone wrong look i will never win this argument i was quoting a car insurance advert which my wife often quotes to me thinking of michael winner anyway i wont do it again the prime minister used the interview to argue that his governments record on womens issues was better than billed if you take the four issues pensions carers pay and childcare id say weve made pretty good progress on all of those he also stressed the importance of domestic life and how difficult it was to care for children especially young ones like his threeyearold daughter he said i am always struck when i am left in charge which i am every now and then that it is very very hard work in fact over the weekend it was only for the princely time of four oclock on friday to lunchtime on saturday i had florence all on my own i loved it and we had a fantastic time but its hard work you are on it all the time the obligatory selfdeprecating parenting anecdote came as he recounted taking over as his nineyearold daughter nancy made a fruit sorbet with an electric mixer halfway through she said dad you are just totally

every time a celebrity is acquitted of rape allegations a pernicious media campaign clamours for anonymity for defendants to stop women and children from wrecking vulnerable mens lives most recently we saw this after the michael le vell trial women against rape war and lisa avalos began to work on collaborative research in to compare how women accused of lying are treated in the us and the uk despite different legal systems the findings shine a light on the uk with poor investigations being found to be the central obstacle to justice in both countries false reports are extremely rare the chief crown prosecutor for london alison saunders says that studies have indicated that only of all reported rapes are false which is slightly less than false reporting in all other crimes their incidence is dwarfed by the prevalence of unpunished sexual violence the international association of chiefs of police iacp in the us claims that only of all rapists serve prison terms for their crimes this is the context for the prosecution of women who report rape this happened in three cases that the us research profiles patty wisconsin sara reedy pennsylvania and dm washington state found themselves treated as suspects after reporting rape to the police each was prosecuted for false reporting her name cleared only when her rapist was caught raping again when dms rapist marc oleary was caught photos of his many victims including dm were found on his phone he is now in prison for multiple rapes at least three committed after dm reported reedys rapist wilbur brown carried out at least two attacks after police didnt investigate reedys complaint when caught he confessed to raping reedy and is currently in prison for at least sexual assaults pattys story is similar dna evidence conclusively linked convicted rapist joseph bong to her rape but not until pattys efforts to clear her name bankrupted her these cases show some of the tragic consequences of prosecuting those who report rape consider jimmy saviles victims many of whom went to the police and had their complaints disregarded enabling him to continue offending according to the iacp the most significant barrier to successful investigations and prosecutions is the powerful and pervasive myth that most sexual assault allegations are false it has designed guidelines to ensure proper investigation the guidelines require police to set aside myths about rape and to approach victims with empathy and an open mind they instruct police not to become sceptical because of a victims postassault behaviour such as inconsistencies which may reflect the trauma they suffered not to pressure a victim to retract and not to stop investigating a rape and shift their suspicions to the victim iacp guidelines were clearly not followed in the three cases above in each police decided early the woman had lied disregarded physical evidence of the rape and investigated her rather than her rapist they also put severe pressure on each woman to retract dm and patty did and the police then used the retraction to charge them iacp guidelines also state that a report of sexual assault can only be considered false if the evidence establishes that no crime was committed or attempted and only after a thorough investigation if this one guideline had been followed all three prosecutions would never have happened how many other rape victims were prosecuted because of incomplete police investigations we havent had such conclusive proof in the uk because the attackers of for example gail sherwood and layla ibrahim imprisoned after reporting rape have not been identified but was sloppy or sexist police work an issue another uk woman was prosecuted for false retraction despite the police knowing the man was violent and recently one teenager who came to war for help would have been prosecuted had she not persisted new tests found semen where police claimed there was none the rape prosecution was reopened there is no parallel clamour in the us for anonymity for men accused of rape to single out rape defendants from defendants of other heinous crimes including murder would be considered unjustifiable a key reason war has opposed it in the uk but the prosecution of women for alleged false reports strengthens the myth that women frequently lie about being raped and discourages victims from coming forward it diverts law enforcement away from thoroughly investigating rape and lets rapists loose on the public it is not in the public interest and must be stopped this is even more urgent in the uk where women are much more likely to be jailed than in the us most us states consider false reporting a misdemeanor while sherwood was sentenced to two years ibrahim to three,2013-09,every time

said labours promises would require more than extra borrowing for each household in javid said ed balls knows this is not allowed under the budget responsibility act and the obrs charter so this is just a stunt to try and distract attention from the fact that labour have been found out for making unfunded commitments that would just mean more borrowing and more debt balls will say childcare is a vital part of our economic infrastructure that alongside family support and flexible working should give parents the choice to stay at home with their children when they are very small and to balance

mark littlewood director of the institute of economic affairs lets start with the obvious lunch i hope we can agree is basically a good thing nutritional uplifting convivial educational lunches are even better and having young kids enjoying these sort of lunches would be simply marvellous so far so good sadly the new government policy of spending m a year for free school meals for infants is yet another attempt to ensure that state bureaucrats assume the role of parents i anticipate that in aggregate these bur eaucrats will take on this task with enthusiasm determination extreme confidence and horrific inefficiency additionally some of these bureaucrats will get richer as they do so it is not the job of the government to provide lunch for every child aged five six or seven for all but the poorest and most disadvantaged this is a responsibility of parents at the cost of for every single man woman and child in britain every year the lib dems have decided to contract out the dietary needs of our young children to the likes of the local authority caterers association with the enthusiastic endorsement of lobbyists such as the child poverty action group this is not a serious effort to reduce hardship if it was the children of millionaires would not get their lunch paid for by the hardpressed taxpayer this is just another gimmicky policy shifting power away from ordinary people and into the hands of the state carmel mcconnell founder of magic breakfasts nick cleggs free school lunch announcement for five to sevenyearolds is very good news and based on sound evidence from free school meal pilots as well as a decade of campaigning from a wide crosssection of the school food community the most recent push for this came from the school food plan commissioned by michael gove and published by the department for education it has strong endorsement from the lib dems as weve seen this week as well as labour universal free school meal policy has both a business case and a moral case and it makes sense whether you see it from the perspective of the child parent teacher or taxpayerssociety as a whole leaving aside the moral case which i think we all get giving a free healthy hot lunch to all children will improve the health and education outcomes of a whole generation in newham and durham two of the free school meal pilot sites students in the pilot areas were on average two months ahead of their peers elsewhere yes improvements were seen to be stronger in children from economically disadvantaged families but does that matter we know that only of packed lunches meet the nutritional levels of the average hot school lunch so if we want acrosstheboard educational and health outcomes free school lunches is an absolute nobrainer id argue the case to extend it across all primary school children and offer universal free school breakfasts as well in schools where children arrive too hungry to learn ml i dont think we should leave aside the moral case i dont think we all get it i certainly dont what is moral about demanding that a childless person on the minimum wage pays taxes towards feeding the children of millionaires for me the moral case starts with two assumptions the first is that parents should pay for the food consumed by their own children this is of course a rebuttable assumption there are already provisions in place to ensure poorer families are given assistance the second assumption is that parents not school bureaucrats should be given responsibility for childrens diets i have no doubt there is a plethora of experts who feel quite certain they know whats best and that responsibility should be stripped from parents and given to them again there may be extreme cases where the state needs to outtrump parental discretion but school lunches is simply not one of them if there is a business case to be made and im rather sceptical about this then make that business case to the parents the overwhelming majority of them care passionately about their childrens health and education if you are a provider of hot school meals and can show that of parents who supply packed lunches to their kids would be much better advised to purchase your offering instead then go out and persuade them you need to run a decent marketing campaign you certainly dont warrant a m slug of taxpayers cash to supply your product to a captive audience cm you started by saying that a good lunch enjoyed in convivial surroundings is a good thing so the moral case is simply that in order for children to do well they need to eat well we start the moral argument from different places there are children eligible for free school meals who have not registered due in some part to the difficulties of getting through the bureaucratic and somewhat demeaning system of proving low income the universal free school lunch provision does away with that injustice as well as the tons of time and moneysapping effort in schools and local authorities to administer the system and with the chair of the nutrition committee at the royal college of paediatrics and child health dr colin michie pointing out that there are children hospitalised with malnutrition right now in this country and increasing numbers of children needing foodbank support i had hoped that the moral case for good food in schools did not need to be underlined i understand what youre saying about not providing subsidy to the children of millionaires of course one of the teachers in the pilot studies pointed out that richer children are not charged for drama or gym even though their parents could pay more how far do we rebut universality should i say that women should pay less tax towards prisons given that most prisoners are men should we ask for salary slips at the gp you are right too to emphasise the importance of parental responsibility however if a parent is not able to provide what is best for their child either through poverty or lack of food skills or lack of time then what do we do ignore the childs needs perhaps let their young minds grasp at an hour of mathematics fuelled by a packed lunch consisting of a swiss roll or yesterdays leftovers schools that have taken part in one of the universal free school lunch pilots reported improved child concentration and behaviour in school grades went up children ate more vegetables if we believe in education dont we also want to make sure our children make the most of their school time isnt investing in learning a good idea now to packed lunches this is not about the state outtrumping parents facing tough facts parents currently spend almost bn on packed lunches but only of them meet nutritional standards and separating out packedlunch children and hotschoolmeal children is simply a pain for most schools read the school food plan for much more on this as a taxpayer i am very happy to know well make the most of our education system by giving more children a free hot lunch schools are where children learn this new provision will i hope boost longterm health by helping children gain an early love of good food to try new foods and enjoy doing so with their friends it is a great investment ml well we may need to differ on what constitutes a moral case there are many things in the world that are nice and desirable this doesnt amount to a moral case that the government should provide them though in terms of universality i think we need to move away from it overall government spending on welfare is way too high the obligation on the state should be to spend less but spend where it is most needed if the present system is bureaucratic and demeaning reform the present system dont widen it at best you are making a case that school lunches should be compulsory but that is not the same as the taxpayer footing the bill i think you give away the game in your last point though that the present arrangements of children having different eating habits is not convenient for schools too often these days policies seemed designed around the desires and needs of public sector workers not the choices of the people they are employed to serve cm im not playing a game im passionate about all children getting the chance to do well at school and right now too many miss out on the full classroom experience because they are hungry or malnourished for one in four children the only hot meal they receive is the meal provided at school and the flip side of poor nutrition is obesity an incredible of children at reception stage if we make sure more children get a hot healthy meal at lunchtime and breakfast youll have gathered im keen on that we will reduce the bn we spend each year on dietrelated illnesses weve also got about half a million people in this country

labour will offer parents of primary school children guaranteed access to childcare from am to pm as the party opens a crucial annual conference dedicated to showing it is on the side of those struggling with falling living standards the pledge will come after ed miliband gave a firm commitment on friday that a future labour government will abolish the bedroom tax in a measure that is likely to be highly popular with its natural supporters as the party demonstrates it is prepared to take bold action labours conference in brighton will also see pledges to strengthen the minimum wage in specific sectors such as retail and catering as growth returns as well as fresh action to crack down on energy utilities commitment to a new programme of social housing is also expected however the conference starts against a backdrop of falling poll ratings the revelations of the poisonous briefing wars conducted by gordon browns former spin doctor damian mcbride and continuing signs of the economy slowly recovering under the coalition yvette cooper the shadow home secretary made clear that the party would focus on the future with concrete policy announcements cooper who is also shadow minister for women and equalities told the guardian in an interview childcare is a top priority for the next election its about supporting families the economy and equality its a really important issue for us and we want to go further than we have before she said childcare should be seen as just as important as other infrastructure investments such as transport and that labour would be announcing a guarantee to every parent that they will be able to get wraparound childcare from to every day provision for parents represents an emerging political battleground with the labour move coming days after nick clegg announced that m a year would be spent on free school meals for all children in the first three years of primary school figures released by the labour party suggests that afterschool provision has been hit hard by austerity measures since the coalition government came to power in with of local authorities reporting a cut in afterschool clubs last year while breakfast clubs have closed in of local areas the plans would mean that local schools could club together to provide care for a typical working day miliband is set to unveil the proposals which will largely be funded by existing central government funds in a speech focusing on the impact of the increased cost of living he is expected to say one question i hear time and again from working mums with school age children is why does it need to be this hard but this government is making things worse its harder now for parents to find the childcare they need before and after school the plans will be formally announced on sunday by stephen twigg as head of labours childcare commission the theme of milibands conference speech on tuesday will be that britain can do better douglas alexander the shadow foreign secretary told the guardian in an interview there is an almost imprisoning cynicism towards the condition of britain and the capacity of britain to be better in the future at the moment and as a party of the progressive centre left we have to counter that cynicism with a message that britain can be better in the future taking an unlikely source of inspiration the mp one of those tipped to run labours election campaign added the reagan formulation from against jimmy carter was words are you better off than you were four years ago it seems to me that david cameron has no convincing answer to that question labours bedroom tax pledge will cost as much as m year but the party said the costs can be met closing tax scams in the construction industry abandoning the governments sharesforrights scheme and reversing george osbornes m tax cut for hedge funds announced in the budget in the m estimated savings in construction comes from a clampdown on the disguised workers scheme whereby workers pretend to be selfemployed to reduce tax miliband will on saturday describe the bedroom tax as a symbol of an outoftouch uncaring government standing up for the interests of the privileged few and never for you he will say two thirds of the people affected are disabled and the vast majority do not have the option of moving into smaller accommodation it represents the first time labour has given an unambiguous pledge to repeal a government welfare measure and will put pressure on the liberal democrats in the commons to support abolition after its own party conference also called for repeal of the bedroom tax the tuc last week found that one in three council tenants have fallen behind on their rent since the introduction of the bedroom tax with in some areas the figure reached three quarters of council tenants including in barrow and cumbria the tax part of the welfare reform act was introduced only in april and charges workingage tenants in social housing based on how many spare rooms they have benefits are reduced by for one room and for two or more bedrooms on average an individual affected by the tax is losing between and a week ministers have introduced discretionary payments for councils to ease the impacts on tenants liberal democrats voted overwhelmingly at their conference in glasgow to condemn the bedroom tax nick clegg continued to defend the tax on the grounds that families were living in overcrowded accommodation yet m possess spare bedrooms he claimed the coalition was simply applying the same principle to the social rented sector as labour applied to the private rented sector sajid javid the treasury minister said labours first policy commitment after three years of waiting is more spending on housing benefit funded by a tax on pensions and more borrowing that sums up labours record in office and shows its still the same old labour despite promising discipline on borrowing ed miliband has shown he is too weak to deliver nothing has changed its the same old labour and hardworking people would pay the price through higher taxes and higher mortgage rates,2013-09,labour offer parent primary school

the liberal democrats may have to consider introducing positive discrimination to boost their number of female mps after the next election and combat a deeply frustrating lack of women in parliament one of the partys cabinet ministers has said the party has traditionally rejected allwomen shortlists as out of keeping with its values but ed davey told the guardian that the lib dem record on female mps was not good enough and alternatives may have to be considered after the energy secretary was speaking amid fears that the lib dems could lose more women mps at the next election and after it emerged that sarah teather one of the partys most highprofile women mps would be standing down from her brent central seat several of the partys six other women mps face tough fights in marginal seats speaking to the guardian at the end of the partys successful annual conference in glasgow davey whose wife emily has stood unsuccessfully for parliament several times said he strongly supports current programmes to encourage more female mps but is growing concerned the party may have to do more to redress the balance progress has not been good enough on getting more female and ethnic minority mps everybody in the party finds it deeply frustrating current efforts to get more female mps without positive discrimination are rightly being tested to destruction i would think long and hard about positive discrimination if it doesnt work next time the party already has the worst gender balance of the three major parties with seven women out of mps the proportion of compares with for the conservatives after david cameron temporarily brought in an alist to promote women ahead of the election of labour mps are women supported by a policy of femaleonly shortlists in some constituencies the lib dem lack of female representation goes all the way to the top with no women among nick cleggs fivestrong cabinet team and just three female mps holding government jobs jo swinson lynne featherstone and jenny willott the party has no plans to experiment with allwomen shortlists prior to the election because it is trying to solve the problem through its candidate leadership programme a scheme to mentor new politicians from a variety of backgrounds the lib dems are also under pressure to prove they listen to the concerns of women after the party was hit by a sexual harassment scandal earlier this year at the time clegg admitted the party failed to do enough to investigate allegations made by female activists that lord rennard the partys former chief executive had behaved inappropriately the peer denies the accusations however many in the grassroots of the party are strongly opposed to the idea of positive discrimination a recent survey by the lib dem voice website found twothirds of party members are opposed to allwomen shortlists compared with just a quarter in favour lorely burt mp for solihull and chair of the liberal democrat women group said she believed that the party should continue with its existing approach to selecting candidates burt whose own majority is just said we can do what we had last time which is have of our best target seats with women fighting them but we didnt win them unless we win some more seats we are not going to get more women its a function of the firstpastthepost system which we fought on we are as frustrated as anyone weve got an excellent training programme targeting getting underrepresented individuals from women to ethnic minorities to disability groups to lgbt candidates into winnable seats but weve still got to win them another mp arguing for considering a change in the way candidates are chosen is norman lamb the care minister he too said the party may need to resort to more positive action to bring in more women although he was not particularly keen on allwomen shortlists i tend to support exploring ways to take positive action because its selfevident that our approach so far hasnt achieved a proper balance he said he was also concerned that the macho and aggressive atmosphere of politics deters too many women from putting their names forward lady grender who was press secretary to former leader lord ashdown said one critical proposal is trying to get female candidates to stand in seats where lib dem mps such as sir alan beith are retiring because were so democratic and for all sorts of small liberal reasons we havent imposed allwomen shortlists its always down to the constituency she said linda jack who has fought several elections as a lib dem candidate and chairs the liberal left group said it has to be a worry that the scandal will discourage new female candidates she argued that allwomen shortlists are worth considering despite the fact they are a clunky instrument its about do we want to reflect the society we represent in terms of women bmes and class she said if you say you just rely on the best person always getting the job you would have to say women and bme candidates are by their very nature inferior because they are so underrepresented but julian huppert lib dem mp for cambridge said he believed allwomen shortlists are patronising to women he said it

every child at infant school in england will receive free lunches from next september nick clegg will announce on wednesday in a bn coalition deal that will allow the tories to introduce a marriage tax allowance by the end of the year as the liberal democrats step up their campaign to draw up sharp differences with their coalition partners the deputy prime minister will contrast his support for free school meals with tory demands for the marriage tax allowance in his closing speech to the lib dem conference after winning a series of crunch votes a newly emboldened clegg will make clear that the mayear scheme was the price he had demanded to support david camerons tax scheme george osborne will announce plans for the marriage tax allowance which will cost a similar sum in his autumn statement this year the lib dems will abide by their commitment in the coalition agreement to abstain in a commons vote introducing the allowance allowing it to pass the deputy prime minister will contrast the values of the lib dems who pressed for the provision of free school meals for an extra million children with those of the tories hailing the scheme which will save parents a year and reintroduce the concept of universal benefits at a time of austerity clegg will say the conservatives have made it clear that their priority is to help some families over others with a tax break for married couples a tax break for some funded through the taxes of others that tells you everything you need to know about their values we however will help all families in these tough times not just the kind we like best by helping their young children get the best possible start in life and that tells you everything about ours the announcement was the result of a direct deal between cameron and clegg the tories were interested in the idea of free school meals which were suggested in the school food plan commissioned by michael gove but the extra spending was not a priority for cameron who announced in summer that the marriage tax allowance would be introduced this year a senior lib dem source said they want to spend roughly the same amount on the marriage tax we want to spend it on this it is a straightupanddown deal the lib dem move means that an extra million children aged between five and seven will be entitled to free school meals this will take to million the number of infant school pupils eligible for the meals children whose parents are on low incomes already qualify cleggs decision to highlight the nature of coalition deals and what they say about the contrasting values of the two parties shows how he is determined to highlight lib dem achievements and to draw dividing lines with the tories he will deliver his fourth conference speech as deputy prime minister after a week in glasgow in which he saw off challenges from the left on tax policy trident deficit reduction and nuclear power ministers joked about their one loss the vote denouncing the bedroom tax we didnt make much of an effort on that one for obvious reason because most of us agreed with the motion one said clegg will argue he is determined to stake out the middle ground of british politics and to remain neutral over the lib dems choice of coalition partner when he depicts the partys role as a restraining influence on the two main parties in a sign that he is keener than ever to stay on in government after the election he will say the country is finally emerging from the biggest economic crisis in living memory the absolute worse thing to do would be to give the keys to no to a singleparty government labour or the conservatives labour would wreck the recovery the conservatives would give us the wrong kind of recovery only the liberal democrats can finish the job and finish it in a way that is fair clegg who will give a personal account of his privileged background and of his familys role in turbulent twentieth century continental europe will declare that the lib dems are not some subset of the larger parties and will say were no ones little brother clegg regards the free school meals announcement as one of the most significant since he entered government in their school food plan this year the leon restaurants founders henry dimbleby and john vincent supported universal free school meals for primary school children after citing research finding that it had educational benefits in addition to nutritional advantages the study under the last government in three boroughs durham newham and wolverhampton found academic benefits that outstripped those from the introduction of the literacy hour the clegg proposal received widespread praise from childrens groups and teaching unions but two rightwing thinktanks the institute of economic affairs and the centre for policy studies criticised it ryan bourne of the cps said there was me thinking we had huge public borrowing the poorest children are already eligible for free school meals the main beneficiaries of this new universal benefit will be middle and upper income households who really dont need a public subsidy i thought that with the huge deficit ageing population and productivity pressures in the public sector it was becoming acknowledged that universal benefits were unsustainable,2013-09,every child infant school england receive free lunch next september nick clegg announce wednesday bn

provision of universal free schools for million children between the ages of five and seven is a sign of the liberal democrats determination to give every child the best start in life the measure will save parents a year liberal democrat sources said george osborne would formally confirm the move in his autumn statement it was the direct result of a deal between the two sides of the coalition they said the lib dems demanded the money for the free school meals after the chancellor said he would need a similar sum of money to deliver a marriage tax allowance alison garnham chief executive of the child poverty action group welcomed the news and said it was an excellent example of how helping parents with the cost of living can also prevent some of the costs of child poverty mounting up she added providing free school meals for young primary school children will help put pounds in the pockets of parents struggling to pay for school lunches but it is also a necessary investment for the future that will pay off by improving child health and raising educational attainment no child should be too hungry to learn but mark littlewood director general of the institute for economic affairs a free market thinktank said it was a waste of money this is an enormously bad use of public money not unreasonably the government already ensures that those in need have access to free school meals so it beggars belief that we are now going to see a policy instated which will subsidise the children of affluent families if the government meaningfully wants to ease the burden of rising living costs then they would be better placed to introduce a tax cut each year and give parents some choice clegg has said that he will not let labour force him out of the lib dem leadership as a condition for labour forming a coalition with the lib dems in the event of a hung parliament in a series of interviews covering a range of subject see pm he also reaffirmed his willingness to work with either labour or the conservatives in the event of no party gaining a majority in charles kennedy the former lib dem leader won a standing ovation from delegates after delivering a staunch defence of britains membership of the european union as the press association reports he told activists to stand tall and be the proeurope voice in next years european parliament elections even if it made them unpopular recalling his decision to oppose iraq even early on when it was popular kennedy said you can take a distinct position that is not necessarily popular with everybody but which marks you out so people can recognise your sincerity and honesty and make a case that none of the others are prepared to make thats our responsibility next year at these european elections we can forget ukip we can forget the tories we can forget labour if the voice of rational proeuropeanism is going to be heard there is only one place it can come from and it should be us and it will be us this is what we should be passionate about and if it makes us unpopular in certain quarters lets be unpopular for what we care about and what we believe in and what defines us and what we think is best for our country im happier to be unpopular for that than i am for some of the things were having to swallow as a result of the age of austerity in which we live lets go forward for these elections front foot unequivocal proeurope britain needs to hear it we believe it lets go for it jeremy browne the home office minister has complained about the intrusiveness of google street view at a fringe meeting he said google pictured him carrying a ministerial red box in london thats all from me for today thanks for the comments and heres some more reaction from twitter from gaby hinsliff the commentator from the new statesmans george eaton from the spectators james forsyth from the bbcs ross hawkins heres some twitter reaction to the free school meals announcement from the left from jessica asato a labour candidate from the leftwing commentator owen jones from labour mp diana johnson from sunny hundal from liberal conspiracy there are more details of the free school meals announcement in nicholas watts guardian story the lib dems are also saying that teenagers who go to sixthform colleges will be eligible for free school meals if they are from lowincome families this will correct the anomaly that allows them to get free school meals if they are at school but not at college nick clegg has been doing a round of sitdown interviews with broadcasters today they covered a wide range of subjects and they were embargoed until pm the interviews were with the bbc itv sky news channel news and channel the quotes come from the press association here are the key points clegg said he expected taxes to go up after asked if there would be taxes rises after the election he said i think theres going to be a mix as there is now between tax increases and spending cuts he denied that lib dems wanted to raise taxes on people earning more than that briefing document that said this is wrong he said it doesnt reflect my thinking at all that was because the lib dems are not interested in increasing taxes on income in other words they dont want to increase taxes on people because they earn more than but they might increases taxes on people who coincidentally happen to earn more than this is what clegg said weve been very clear that what we want to do is move away from taxing hard work and enterprise and move towards a system of fairer taxes on land and wealth so no we have no income tax level in our mind about when tax should rise that is not true that is wrong clegg also said that a salary of might look large to someone on but that it doesnt feel very large if you are on and struggling to make ends meet he challenged the conservatives to say what they would cut after the general election the question for the conservatives is if they are not prepared to ask people in socking great mansions to pay a bit extra which public services are going to suffer because they are going to have to find those bn from spending cuts instead he said he was feeling chipper because he thought the lib dems would recover i probably am chipper because intuitively in my gut i think we will recover and we will do better than many of our critics pretend that we will asked about feeling chipper clegg also said that he had done a lot of exercise this summer which also contributed to his feeling of wellbeing he said he could imagine remaining as deputy prime minister after the election but with ed miliband as prime minister not david cameron asked if he would feel comfortable saying bye bye david cameron hello ed he said he would i tell you why i could it isnt about my personal preference this isnt about my personal preferences it isnt about whether this person likes that person more or whether they get on better with this person its not about that it is about following the instructions the instructions manual handed to us he said he did not know whether miliband would be a good prime minister i have no idea it hasnt happened it hasnt happened yet i dont think you should judge people until they have been able to prove themselves he suggested he would not let labour insist on his being replaced as lib dem leader as a condition of a labourlib dem coalition its not for them to handpick which individual liberal democrats they work with in the same way as its not for me to handpick the labour team he said he had good personal relations with cameron and miliband but that this was irrelevant to what would happen in a hung parliament of course we get on fine as prime minister and deputy prime minister i get on well with ed miliband on a personal level i can get on with people it doesnt mean i have to agree with them our relationship is not governed by what our personal attitudes are towards each other its can we work together one as leader of the conservative party one as leader of the liberal democrats in the national interest he said vince cable was wrong to suggest the coalition could end before to be fair to vince he made it clear that first and foremost it is a decision for the leader i am the leader of the party i have made it very clear to demonstrate that coalition government works but also to demonstrate that we are doing the job of clearing up this monumental economic mess left to us by labour we need the full five years he said that as the election approached he and cameron would both start to adopt a more partisan stance of course in the latter stages of the parliament i suspect david cameron and i will be charging around the country talking as leader of the conservative party and leader of the liberal democrats i think most people can easily distinguish between when we are acting in coalition government and when we are promoting our separate different views as party leaders on behalf of our parties he said he never thought a coalition with labour was possible after the last election after the last election gordon brown and myself sat down because gordon brown wanted to explore the possibility of a labourliberal democrat coalition i said to him i remember saying to him very very vividly over and over again we cant do this because there is no mandate from the british people to do that because the number of labour and liberal democrat mps were not sufficient to create a majority he said the government was constantly reviewing the bedroom tax this government is reviewing the bedroom tax and how it is being applied all the time i spoke to iain duncan smith about it just a few days ago its why i intervened over the summer to significantly increase the pot of money in the discretionary housing payment to allow councils to help individuals and individual households who are caught out unfairly nick clegg has announced that from september next year all infant school pupils in england ie pupils in receptionyear and year will get free school meals this will cost m and will be worth on average for every pupil who benefits the government will tell us how it is being funded in the autumn statement the lib dems are saying they got the conservatives to agree the plan as a condition for allowing the conservatives to go ahead with a tax break for married couples details of which george osborne will announce in the autumn statement officially clegg is announcing the news tomorrow although effectively he is announcing it now because the news was embargoed until pm heres an extract from tomorrows speech im delighted to tell you that we are now also going to provide free school meals for all children in infant school from next september well give every child in reception year and year a healthy lunch every day saving families more than per year per child for the liberal democrats this is a first step my ambition is to provide free school meals for all primary school children another reason we want to get into government again next time round the conservatives on the other hand have made it clear that their priority is to help some families over others with a tax break for married couples a tax break for some funded through the taxes of others that tells you everything you need to know about their values we however will help all families in these tough times not just the kind we like best by helping their young children get the best possible start in life and that tells you everything about ours the lib dems say that pilots have shown that free school meals are even more effective than the literacy hour at improving the achievement of pupils because children work more effectively if they are properly fed children from poor families already qualify for free school meals and so the policy is open to the charge that it is actually helping middleincome and wealthy parents not poor ones but the lib dems says that of children living in poverty do not claim free school meals charles kennedy the former lib dem leader has just been speaking in the europe debate he said he blamed tony blair more than anyone else for britains predicament in europe on europe blair ran scared of the press and of gordon brown he said he was implying that britain should have joined the single currency john woodcock the labour mp for barrow and furness says the lib dems new policy on trident could decimate britains submarine building industry based in his constituency it is very disappointing to see government ministers letting down the country and showing contempt for the furness economy by continuing to press their halfbaked plan for a parttime nuclear deterrent the idea that britain should put its nuclear warheads in longterm storage in a cupboard as they describe it would greatly weaken the countrys ability to deter a hostile nuclear strike and incur significant extra costs to offset any savings the liberal democrats irresponsible desperation to have something different to say to the deterrent would put our longterm security at risk and could decimate the uks submarine building industry based in barrow here is some more from danny alexanders speech alexander said the treasury would launch a campaign to persuade landlords to pay the outstanding tax they own to hm customs and revenue it is estimated that landlords owning multiple properties owe more than m in unpaid tax he said the campaign will warn them that they will face the consequences if they do not pay up he said that gladstones portrait hangs in his office and that gladstone once said the idea of abolishing income tax is highly attractive he said nationalism was the opposite of liberalism nationalism is all about building barriers between people whatever the cost he said liberalism is about knocking down those barriers down mike hancock the lib dem mp for portsmouth south faces a council standards committee hearing the press association reports heres the pa story an mp faces a local council standards hearing after an investigation found he had breached its code of conduct mike hancock resigned the liberal democrat party whip in june to fight a high court civil action by a vulnerable constituent who accuses him of sexual assault after she contacted him for help the portsmouth south mp who is also a councillor in the south coast city firmly denies the claims he will now appear before a standards subcommittee of the local authority after a councilcommissioned report by nigel pascoe qc concluded there was a case to answer cllr hancock andor his legal advisers will have the opportunity to respond to the report and question witnesses and the reports author donna jones the chair of the subcommittee that reviewed the report said the hearings subcommittee will then make a final decision it would not be appropriate to make a decision on publication of the report until the process is concluded danny alexander the chief secretary to the treasury has just finished his speech to the conference he made this announcement about his latest tax avoidance crackdown we are cutting corporation tax to encourage firms to invest but not to give the wealthy a way to avoid the p income tax rate so when the vast majority of people in an industry are finding ways to exploit that difference and that industry is the preserve of the very wealthy i have no hesitation in acting it is why i can announce today that following a brief consultation we will be closing the loophole that allows private equity shareholders to siphon money out of their firms while dodging the intended income tax and its why i can also announce that we will also be closing the loophole that allows partners in partnerships to structure their staff arrangements so that they avoid the correct amount of income tax its wrong its unfair and its got to stop and with liberal democrats in government it will alexanders speeches to the lib dem conference always seem to involve a tax avoidance announcement oliver letwin i think supposedly once told him that a tory would get booed for making an announcement like this at party conference but a lib dem minister can announce a tax avoidance crackdown and get a cheer but today this one only got a small round of applause it does sound very technical the lib dems have endorsed a plan to significantly reduce britains nuclear deterrent by ending regular patrols by submarines armed with trident missiles see pm danny alexander the chief secretary to the treasury has slapped down his liberal democrat colleague vince cable for suggesting there could be an early split with the conservatives norman lamb the care minister also said he thought cable was wrong to suggest that ending the coalition before the election was a possibility what would be the explanation of leaving before the job was done a government is in power through the parliament and it would be ridiculous to jump ship and leave the conservatives in charge for that final period fiona hall the leader of the lib dem meps has suggested that the ukip leader nigel farage spends most of his working time as an mep in the pub this is what she said in her speech to the conference of course there are things we want to change at a european level wed like to get rid of nigel farage for a start actually i think weve succeeded on that one already he is so rarely seen in the european parliament that people now call him nigel mirage ukip meps have the worst attendance records in the european parliament while lib dem meps are working to get the best deal for their constituents mr mirage is down the pub talk about a waste of taxpayers money lynne featherstone the international development minister has said that female genital mutilation fgm would not have lasted four minutes if boys willies were being cut off she was speaking in a debate on sexual and domestic violence of all the terrible things that are done to women across the world from the uk right across the world female genital mutilation has to be a priority because to me it is totemic it symbolises that brutal oppression of women its a practice that has been going years and without wishing to be crude about this quite frankly if it was boys willies that were being cut off without anaesthetic it wouldnt have lasted four minutes let alone years sir andrew stunell the former communities minister has said that nazistyle employment restrictions could have been required in order to implement the immigration policy the lib dems had at the last election as the press association reports stunell mocked the regional immigration policy and raised the possibility that police checkpoints would have been needed to enforce it speaking at a fringe meeting he said how are you going to do that is everybody going to have an identity card are we going to have police checks or are they simply going to catch a coach down to london each week it just doesnt work im sorry perhaps we penalise employers who take on people who are only licensed to work in yorkshire you could do it you could do it of course the germans did it in but i dont know that thats exactly the route we want to go down norman baker the rail minister has announced plans to give people more flexibility when buying rail tickets heres an extract from the news release baker has announced plans for a pilot scheme that could see all longdistance rail tickets sold on a singleleg basis and allow passengers to more easily mix and match each ticket type when planning a return journey the proposals would end the situation where passengers face paying almost the same for a single fare as for a return allowing passengers to break up their journey in the way that works best for them currently the government regulates the price of offpeak return fares meaning train operating companies are able to price other tickets including offpeak singles more freely this can lead to a situation where the cost of single tickets is similar to that of returns jo swinson the business minister has announced plans to make household bills and consumer services more transparent heres an extract from the news release these include cracking down on excessive mobile phone roaming charges stopping hidden price hikes in renewal notices and making it easier for people to pay costly annual bills in more manageable instalments household budgets will also benefit from a telecoms consumer action plan making sure consumers have the right information and advice at their fingertips to get the best deals on phones internet and other telecoms products cable has said that said that the number of international students in british universities has fallen sharply because they do not feel welcome the lib dems have endorsed a plan to significantly reduce britains nuclear deterrent by ending regular patrols by submarines armed with trident missiles by votes to the conference rejected a call for britain to scrap the nuclear deterrent altogether but sir nick harvey the former defence minister said it would be a mistake to underestimate the importance of the scheme which the party say would be the greatest single act of deescalation ever undertaken by one of the established nuclear powers under the lib dem plans when replacing the trident fleet britain would get rid of at least one of the four nucleararmed submarines meaning that the royal navy would no longer be able to operate continuous atsea deterrence casd having one submarine at sea at all times ready to retaliate against an attack casd requires at least four submarines harvey said the lib dems were not just proposing parttime patrols instead the world has changed a great deal since the end of the cold war but our nuclear posture has remained exactly the same we continue to sail the high seas waving weapons of mass destruction at nobody much in particular our own national security assessment has concluded there is nobody out there the proposal we are making today is not we should have a parttime deterrent it is that we should stop these nuclear patrols altogether we will tell the world boldly we no longer see the need to do so and that we have put them to one side harvey said that while routine patrols would not take place britain would retain the ability to send a nucleararmed submarine to sea if circumstances required it danny alexander the chief secretary to the treasury who led the whitehall review of trident said in the debate there was support in the us for the lib dem position its a change that is taken seriously in the united states they recognise that this is within the uk context a significant step that the uk can make on the journey that president obama is talking about towards a world free of nuclear weapons this is a major step in the ladder of disarmament if you like that we can take in the uk alexander also stressed that the lib dem policy was achievable i think of the great merits of the policy position recommended in the paper is that it is one that is deliverable and achievable for us a party and i would much rather that we had a policy that we could achieve in the next government and deliver an actual further step down that ladder of disarmament this is a clear sign that the lib dems consider a coalition with labour a possibility because david cameron has said he is firmly opposed to reducing the number of trident submarines while ed miliband seems open to the possibility the amendment proposing unilateral nuclear disarmament was proposed by george potter an activist he said i take issue with trident in the words of paddy ashdown who once favoured unilateral nuclear disarmament the uks nuclear deterrent is a monstrous folly it is only necessary for us to have an independent nuclear deterrent if three criteria are met one there is a country out there which is nuclear armed two that country actively wishes to destroy the uk with nuclear weapons and noone else three that country will be deterred by us having an independent nuclear deterrent delegates have voted against the nuclear disarmament motion by votes to lib dem conference rejects call for the party to adopt unilateral nuclear disarmament as a policy ill post a summary shortly it has been a relatively quiet morning at the conference but this afternoon it might perk up nick clegg has been giving some sitdown tv interviews which are embargoed until later and theyre said to contain some news lines they are voting on the nuclear weapons amendment on a show of cards it is too close to call and so there is going to be a formal count sir nick harvey the former defence minister is winding up the trident debate he says the proposals to cut the number of submarines in the trident fleet is the boldest measure of nuclear disarmament to come from one of the five countries with a permanent seat on the united nations security council this is not a plan for parttime patrols by trident submarines he says the lib dems would want to stop routine patrols by nucleararmed submarines for good but they would retain the capacity to deploy one of the trident boats in an emergency he says the amendment is fatally flawed it has been described as a unilateralist amendment but it still proposes britain having the right to revive a nuclear deterrent should national security require it he says simon hughes the lib dem deputy leader has just spoken in the defence debate he backed the main motion not the unilateralist one he said that cutting the number of nucleararmed submarines would be an important step forward you can read all todays coverage from the lib dem conference here as for the rest of the papers here are some articles i found particularly interesting benedict brogan in the daily telegraph says a remarkable inversion in british politics is taking place the party that could once be counted on to indulge itself with the easy poses of opposition at every opportunity showing contempt for its leader and indifference to the demands of government is now behaving like a party that is comfortable with government and the responsibilities that come with it meanwhile too many in the tory party once a byword for the pragmatism and hard choices required to win and hold power show every sign of behaving like the liberal democrats of old most noticeably in their contempt for their leader and the relish with which they seek opportunities to defeat him the most obvious indication of this role reversal is when the subject of coalition is broached ask lib dems about the prospects for another arrangement after and naturally because they have a stake in it they talk easily about deals negotiations the balance of power mention it to tories though and they go into a spin of denial and talk of how to prevent mr cameron from cosying up to mr clegg rachel sylvester in the times says nick clegg seems to be the heir to blair perhaps mr clegg not mr cameron is now the heir to blair emulating the man who won three elections by defining himself against the extremes on either side yesterday he was wearing a purple tie the colour used by new labour to symbolise its merging of labour red and tory blue before the summer i had dinner with a group of former downing street strategists from the new labour days they had all worked for mr blair remaining loyal to him and his ideology but far from endorsing his labour successor they agreed were all cleggites now in the view of these blairite diehards the liberal democrat leader is following in the footsteps of their hero far more than mr miliband who has sought every opportunity to distance himself from mr blair steve richards in the independent says that even though the lib dems poll ratings are dire they remain a significant force clegg and his party still have cause for hope but it has little to do with their national poll ratings one of their gloomier mps privately critical of clegg tells me he expects his party to keep two thirds of their seats in which case they will still be a formidable force in the next parliament they may well hold the balance of power once more what follows from that is much more complicated than last time and it was nightmarishly frenzied in i doubt if clegg will get his party to support another coalition with the tories even if cameron wins more seats still such speculation shows the centrality of the liberal democrats clegg and his party are significant players perhaps that significance shelters them from their poll ratings there is no sign that the ratings will rise very much or that the significance will diminish the financial times says that nick clegg has private concerns about the help to buy scheme even though he has defended it in public nick clegg is at odds with his conservative coalition colleagues over the governments help to buy scheme warning privately that it could stoke a fresh housing bubble the deputy prime minister has said publicly that he supports the project but his allies have told the financial times he shares concerns expressed by vince cable about the impact of the second part of the scheme which begins in january the daily mirror says that mobile phone companies could be prevented from imposing excessive roaming charges under plans being announced by jo swinson the business minister mobile phone companies could be banned from stinging customers with hidden roaming charges under plans to be announced today the government will also crack down on firms hiking prices when they issue renewal notices for phone contracts insurance and subscriptions and ministers are to make it easier for customers to pay for goods and services by monthly instalments rather than face costly annual bills lib dem consumer affairs minister jo swinson will announce the government is launching a review into the information provided to consumers by companies danny alexander the chief secretary to the treasury is speaking in the defence debate he led the whitehall review ordered by the lib dems looking into the alternatives to trident he says the review looked at a wide range of options nearly options were originally considered the lib dems discovered that because of the timelines involved putting nucleararmed cruise missiles on submarines was not an option but it would have been an option if labour had conducted a proper review when it was in office he says he says the americans recognise that the plan proposed by the lib dems to cut the number of trident submarines would be a significant step towards the nuclear disarmament president obama wants to achieve he says both options being debated would not save any money in the next parliament the policy proposed is achievable for the lib dems in the next parliament he says that means alexander seems to be considering the possibility of a coalition with labour david cameron has made it clear that he is opposed to cutting the number of nucleararmed submarines labours position is less clear and it is possible that ed miliband could accept the lib dem position in the conference hall delegates are now debating defence the main motion says that lib dems should end whats called continuous atsea deterrence which means having four submarines armed with trident nuclear missiles so that one can be on patrol all time and that instead there should be no more than three submarines enacting this would amount to the greatest single act of deescalation ever undertaken by one of the established nuclear powers it says an amendment has been tabled saying the lib dems should instead eliminate entirely the uks nuclear deterrent as soon as practicable the lib dems have never backed unilateral nuclear disarmament and so the amendment is unlikely to be passed the lib dems have finally worked out the origins of the internal briefing document that was sent out yesterday saying the party was looking at plans to raise taxes for people earning more than an aide has just been in the press room telling us the story he says its a tripledecker cockup the original source was an interview that nick clegg gave at the party conference last year clegg said that the richest were already paying more proportionally than the rest of the population and that the lib dems were looking at ways to get them to pay more on the basis that people earning more than around are in the top of earners the telegraph wrote this up as a proposal to raise taxes on those earning more than this got written up in an internal briefing note for lib dem senior figures on what clegg had said in his interview according to the aide this was an error because it was written up as a proposed tax on income instead of a proposed tax on wealth of course people who have a lot of wealth also tend to be people earning more than but the two concepts are different and the lib dems are touchy about this because if you frame the argument in terms of people earning more than people will assume you are planning to raise income tax this note was filed away last year then someone preparing a briefing for this years party conference just cut and pasted the earning more than passage from the note that was the second blunder and then someone accidentally emailed it to journalists the third cockup ironically this seems to have been one of the few emails from the lib dem press office that has actually got through to the hacks for some reason many of the press releases they have been sending out this week have not been arriving as i mentioned earlier and as you have been talking about btl the today programme did an item on the poor quality of lib dem conference jokes earlier perhaps they were reading my blog from sunday they interviewed charles kennedy the former lib dem leader and a noted wit to ask if he agreed he did i think its right on reflection to say that the conference so far has lacked that element of satire of spiky wit that you need from time to time at the end of the conference season you can usually point from each party to one very telling line that sticks in peoples minds now we havent had one yet kennedy suggested that part of the problem might have been that the conference agenda has been very serious he ended with one of his favourite lib dem jokes from sir malcolm rifkind if christopher columbus had been a liberal democrat he would have discovered the mid atlantic delegates have finished their syria debate there was no motion and a range of views were expressed with some speakers expressing concern that nick clegg did not consult the party properly before supporting david camerons motion backing military intervention in principle opening the debate the lib dem mp martin horwood accused labour of playing politics with the issue and said that was inexcusable ed miliband wanted to show he was not tony blair horwood said he certainly proved that right danny alexander the chief secretary to the treasury has been talking to the broadcasters this morning as i reported earlier he firmly put down vince cables suggestion that the lib dems could leave the coalition before see am here are the other points he was making what was most interesting was what he had to say on tax points and below are not inconsistent but they are close to sounding contradictory and the lib dem announcements on tax this week will probably lead to tory claims that they are planning a secret tax bombshell alexander confirmed that the lib dems would back tax rises after the general election he said that the tax proposals backed by the lib dems in a debate yesterday would probably raise between bn and bn but in an interview on the today programme he also admitted that eliminating the deficit by would require savings of bn when evan davis put it to him that the lib dems would need plans for further tax rises partly because of the need to cut the deficit and partly to fund their plans to raise the income tax threshold alexander replied well sure he said the plans already set out by the lib dems showed that the partys priority would be to ask more of the wealthy he accepted that it would be possible to get rid of the deficit just by cutting spending which is what the conservatives favour but he said this would drive you into choices that i would not agree with but he also rejected claims that the party has specific plans to increase taxes on those earning more than an internal briefing note accidentally leaked to the media yesterday said the lib dems were looking at how the richest of people those earning over could make a further contribution it also said that most people would consider a very large salary but alexander said that the memo doesnt reflect any policies that we have been discussing he did not know where it came from he said he said that people earning were not rich and that the party had no plans to put up any of the rates of income tax its priority was to cut income tax he said he said that some conservative backbenchers were nutty for a lot of people in this country who want politics to be located in the centre ground not dragged off to the left by trade unions or dragged off to the right by some of the more nutty backbenchers in the conservative party you need the liberal democrats in the mix to keep our government in the right place he rejected claims that house prices were rising out of control i dont see any sign of a housing bubble he said he said even after there would be a need for spending restraint there would be no going back to the freespending bonanza of previous years he said he said the home offices go home vans aimed at illegal immigrants were ghastly were into day four of the lib dem conference and looking at todays agenda the news prospects look grim todays proceedings are unlikely to pass the ian katz test the today programme got so desperate that it resorted to a package about the poor quality of the jokes at the glasgow conference of which more later in terms of news the key focus this morning is on vince cables comments last night about the possibility of the coalition breaking up before the general election as nicholas watt reports cable was asked if the coalition could end before polling day he replied its certainly possible we are not at the stage of talking about that process it is obviously a highly sensitive one later on newsnight cable said that any decision about ending the coalition would be collectively decided by our lib dem team closer to the election and that all kind of things are possible but this morning danny alexander chief secretary to the treasury and probably nick cleggs closest ally at the top of the party killed the idea stone dead this is what alexander told itvs daybreak we are proving our track record in government and we are going to stay in the coalition government right up until the election in i read his cables remarks he didnt say that the coalition would split earlier he was asked questions about what was possible what im saying to you is that it is our intention as the leadership of this party to make sure that this coalition lasts right to the election in ill post more what alexander has been saying this morning shortly heres the agenda for the day am debate on syria am debate on giving sign language a legal status am debate on tackling sexual and domestic violence am fiona hall leader of the lib dem meps gives a speech am debate on defence including a vote on whether to abandon the nuclear deterrent pm fringe meetings including

nick cleggs intriguing announcement of an m extension of free school meals to over a million primary school children essentially a response to the uks growing problem of inwork poverty suggests he is desperate to tackle his tattered credibility as a fighter on behalf of the poor and oppressed quite what the coalition a normally rigorous enemy of universal benefits and champion of the small state is doing investing hundreds of millions in a semiuniversal nonmeans tested statefunded statedelivered benefit like free school meals will baffle many on their own side there is nothing nudge about it this is a form of socialism the state feeding the people not a natural lib dem policy let alone a tory one indeed the policy which will apply to m children in reception and years one and two in english primary schools as well as some fe college students is a slightly timid version of the free school meals for all policy pioneered successfully in primary schools in the labourrun london boroughs of newham islington and southwark where ironically and as labour activists have enjoyed pointing out it was bitterly opposed by the local lib dem opposition as southwark leader peter john tweeted triumphantly this afternoon where southwark labour leads others follow labour councils did the groundwork for clegg demonstrating that free school meals work in practice delivering improvements in academic performance and providing much needed respite for financiallystruggling low to middle income families alongside antipoverty lobbyists such as the childrens society have shown the unfairness of existing eligibility rules for free school meals excluding as they do a growing number of children living in poverty and unable to afford a decent midday meal these children are victims of the uks cost of living crisis they do not currently qualify for free school meals because household income is more than a year or their parents are in work but their household income after rent can be as little as a day school meal take up is high among those who get it free around but falls off a cliff to just among the children of the working poor who struggle to meet the average annual school meals cost per child of that group whose midday meal researchers have found is often a snack or a nutritionallypoor packed lunch will benefit most from this policy of the m beneficiaries an estimated younger pupils currently in poverty but ineligible for free school meals will now qualify for the clegg dinners some will be disappointed that the policy only extends to the first three years of a childs primary school career but poverty charities are confident this is only a first step and that parents who come to appreciate free school meals will lobby hard for it to be retained when their child gets to year four it will surely fuel the growing movement in the labour party to extend the free school meals policy even further others may question whether is is right or fair that the children of welloff families will get free school dinners under the scheme but as one islington teacher pointed out in the school food plan published in july by leon restaurateurs henry dimbleby and john vincent at the request of the education secretary michael gove we dont charge richer parents seperately for lessons or books or drama why is it acceptable to charge for the food indeed the leon pair not obviously marxists eloquently demolished the meanstesting argument pointing out that pioneer universal free school meal projects had broken down them and us divisions in schools and fostered a sense of cohesion the plan itself refused to accept that meanstesting was fair if you applied this reasoning across the board you would need to dismantle the state school system and indeed the nhs if there is a net benefit to children and the country as a result of universal free school meals it should not matter if children from wealthier families get well fed too indeed the remarkable school food plan has provided crucial political cover for clegg and the colaition it may not be the comprehensive free school meals roll out dimbleby and vincent wanted but in winning the support in principle of gove they achieved crucial and rare political consensus when it comes to school food it seems we are all socialists now,2013-09,nick clegg intriguing announcement extension free school

author hanna rosin last week asked us to gather in close and listen to her glib explanation of what she considered a little known reality patriarchy is dead rosin isnt one for pulling her punches and i am sure relished the criticisms that followed her central argument that men are no longer dominant in fact they are the aggrieved sex putting aside for the moment the fact that rosin has an incomplete view of patriarchy it isnt solely about male economic power and influence she argues that it is women who have brought about this demise of men her messianic mission to salvage a beleaguered western masculinity is based on this ofttouted argument permutations of which i have had to endure many times it is women who are to blame for taking mens work and thereby causing a crisis in masculinity that has led to all sorts our appalling male suicide figures for one and it is women who are to blame for rape and other genderbased violence lest we be shocked by such a sweeping generalisation rosin makes clear that it is a particular kind of woman that has brought about the end of men the welleducated and confident middleclass woman and it is this aspect of what she had to say that resonated with my experience as a black feminist a new era of female dominance occupied by welleducated ambitious women is rosins chief concern now i do not believe that we live in an era where women are the dominant force within our society too many saddening statistics abound from violence against women and girls to our higher likelihood of living in poverty to the gender pay gap and our low political representation women are not dominant it is true that progress is taking place but to call it dominance is a stretch nevertheless rosins description of elite feminists a group she sees as benefitting from this new era is striking these feminists are characterised by their strong print and online presence and their ability to contribute to dominant discourse to these women rosin asks why should they feel reassured to be told that men are still on top that the old order had not been shaken and in writing that rosin touched upon a raw nerve unwittingly she echoes the words of alice walker who argued that the problem with western feminists is that they take after their brothers and their fathers the struggle for many of these women has just been to get what the men have and share it with them implicit in rosins question is the critique many lgbtq undocumented workingclass disabled and black feminists level at the wider movement if feminism is only about the concerns of the privileged few who now ostensibly wield the same type of power as their fathers and brothers it leaves itself open to criticisms such as hers i often vacillate between boredom and continued frustration at the narrow focuses of the wider feminist movement the success of solidarityisforwhitewomen demonstrates how i am not the only one who feels this sustained sense of dissatisfaction however rosins stance on what she considers the de facto death of patriarchy ignores the very women she believes she is speaking for those that are marginalised she suffers from the same blindspot as the prominent white feminists she reserves much of her vitriol for her logic goes feminists fight patriarchy but patriarchy is dead because influential feminists and successful female graduates now have better prospects in this framework the realities of existing under a maledominated system closely aligned to a capitalist framework for lgbtqblackdisabledworkingclassunderclassundocumented women can be neatly elided she asserts that many single parents and workingclass women yearn to bring back at least some aspects of patriarchy they long to have a man around who would pay the bills and take care of them and make a life for them in which they could work less wanting another individual to help you manage the burden of your poverty is in effect lamenting the death of patriarchy indeed the struggle for single women with children to make ends meet becomes for the purposes of her thesis unrelated to our patriarchal society never mind that of single parents are at an overall risk of poverty and that of them are women or that of women as opposed to of men have a persistent low income nope patriarchy is dead and therefore not at fault i employ a flurry of statistics because some of rosins most dangerous remarks are delivered through the language of euphemism rather than sobering hard facts for example she writes that the big picture of life without patriarchy may not always be consistent with womens daily experiences some women she concedes do have an overbearing husband this i take to be rosins code phrase for domestic violence overbearing sounds very far from the reality in which two women a week die at the hands of their partners or ex at the hands of their partners or ex nevertheless if rosin can lob some fair criticism at the feminist movement it should be worried it needs to ask itself if it truly reflects the diversity of our movement,2013-09,author hanna rosin last week asked u gather close listen glib explanation considered little known reality patriarchy

every child at infant school in england will get free lunches in a m scheme to improve health and educational attainment nick clegg is to announce in his main speech to the liberal democrat conference the deputy prime minister will on wednesday hail the provision of universal free school meals for million children between the ages of five and seven as a sign of the liberal democrats determination to give every child the best start in life the measure will save parents a year liberal democrat sources said george osborne would formally confirm the move in his autumn statement it was the direct result of a deal between the two sides of the coalition they said the lib dems demanded the money for the free school meals after the chancellor said he would need a similar sum of money to deliver a marriage tax allowance clegg will tell the lib dem conference in glasgow im delighted to tell you that we are going to provide free school meals for all children in infant schools from next september well give every child in reception year one and year two a healthy lunch every day saving families more than per year per child for the liberal democrats this is a first step my ambition is to provide free school meals for all primary schoolchildren another reason we want to get into government next time round clegg said the lib dems championing of free school meals highlighted a division with the tories who were more interested in spending a similar sum of money on introducing a marriage tax allowance under the coalition agreement the lib dems will abstain when the allowance is introduced by osborne in the autumn statement clegg will say the conservatives have made it clear that their priority is to help some families over others with a tax break for married couples a tax break for some funded through the taxes of others that tells you everything you need to know about their values we however will help all families in these tough times not just the kind we like best by helping their young children get the best possible start in life and that tells you everything about ours a senior lib dem source reinforced cleggs message by saying the announcement was a result of a deal between the lib dems and the tories they want to spend roughly the same amount on the marriage tax we want to spend it on this it is a straightupanddown deal michael gove the education secretary is likely to say that the idea of universal free school meals for primary schoolchildren was one of the central recommendations in the school food plan which he commissioned the plan written by the leon restaurant founders henry dimbleby and john vincent cited research finding that free school meals had educational benefits in addition to nutritional advantages the authors cited a pilot study in three boroughs durham newham and wolverhampton under the last government which found academic benefits that outstripped those from the introduction of the literacy hour in dimbleby and vincent wrote academically the benefits were clear students in the pilot areas were on average two months ahead of their peers elsewhere between and more children reached the target levels in maths and english at key stage across both pilot areas more children achieved the expected levels in english at key stage this is a bigger improvement than the boost that followed the introduction of a compulsory literacy hour in furthermore these improvements were most marked among children from less affluent families matthew reed chief executive of the childrens society welcomed the announcement he said todays announcement making free school meals available to m more children marks an historic step forward in the fight against child poverty it also marks a significant victory for the childrens societys fair and square campaign which has galvanised over people across the country to call for free school meals to be available to many more children in poverty this latest move clearly shows that the government is recognising the hardship that thousands of families are facing this will lead to more poor children being given the chance to get a free nutritious meal at school,2013-09,every child infant school

michael gove is disingenuous and possibly also illinformed report september when he raises alarm that residential homes for children are built in areas of high crime and often far from their original locality these homes nowadays usually run by private sector providers are opened in areas with low property prices not only because the property price is part of the cost but also because areas with high property prices tend not to welcome an influx of unruly young people in their nice quiet streets and what we are talking about here are often the most difficult to manage teenagers since government policy is that foster placements should always be considered for children first as for many of them being far from home sometimes thats the point the very reasons behind them coming into care in the first place poor parenting and insecure attachments often leading to them acting out their distress with risktaking behaviour crime or drugs are the reasons to move them away from those influences and temptations but the real question is why are so many of these children in care anyway we know that prevention works better than cure but preventive services cost money that local authorities dont now have and instead they find themselves confined to damagelimitation interventions when family situations may already be beyond retrieval if gove actually wants childrens lives to improve he needs to start arguing for increased funding of existing core services but ill not be holding my breath sylvia rose totnes devon it is good to hear michael goves condemnation of the indefensible practice of sending children to live away from their home local authority areas does this mean that his government will now reverse its communitybusting housing benefit reforms which are hitting children and families with similarly cruel effects francis prideaux london,2013-09,michael gove disingenuous possibly also illinformed report september raise alarm residential home child built area high crime often far original locality home nowadays usually run private sector provider opened area low property price property price part cost also area high property price tend welcome influx unruly young people nice quiet street talking often difficult manage teenager since government policy foster placement always considered child first many far home sometimes thats point reason behind coming care first place poor parenting insecure attachment often leading acting distress risktaking behaviour crime drug reason move away influence temptation real question many child care anyway know prevention work better cure preventive service cost money local authority dont instead find confined damagelimitation intervention family situation may already beyond retrieval gove actually want childrens life improve need start arguing increased funding existing core service ill holding breath sylvia rose totnes devon good hear michael goves condemnation indefensible practice sending child live away home local authority area doe mean government reverse communitybusting housing benefit reform hitting child family similarly cruel effect francis prideaux london,"['michael', 'gove', 'disingenuous', 'possibly', 'also', 'illinformed', 'report', 'september', 'raise', 'alarm', 'residential', 'home', 'child', 'built', 'area', 'high', 'crime', 'often', 'far', 'original', 'locality', 'home', 'nowadays', 'usually', 'run', 'private', 'sector', 'provider', 'opened', 'area', 'low', 'property', 'price', 'property', 'price', 'part', 'cost', 'also', 'area', 'high', 'property', 'price', 'tend', 'welcome', 'influx', 'unruly', 'young', 'people', 'nice', 'quiet', 'street', 'talking', 'often', 'difficult', 'manage', 'teenager', 'since', 'government', 'policy', 'foster', 'placement', 'always', 'considered', 'child', 'first', 'many', 'far', 'home', 'sometimes', 'thats', 'point', 'reason', 'behind', 'coming', 'care', 'first', 'place', 'poor', 'parenting', 'insecure', 'attachment', 'often', 'leading', 'acting', 'distress', 'risktaking', 'behaviour', 'crime', 'drug', 'reason', 'move', 'away', 'influence', 'temptation', 'real', 'question', 'many', 'child', 'care', 'anyway', 'know', 'prevention', 'work', 'better', 'cure', 'preventive', 'service', 'cost', 'money', 'local', 'authority', 'dont', 'instead', 'find', 'confined', 'damagelimitation', 'intervention', 'family', 'situation', 'may', 'already', 'beyond', 'retrieval', 'gove', 'actually', 'want', 'childrens', 'life', 'improve', 'need', 'start', 'arguing', 'increased', 'funding', 'existing', 'core', 'service', 'ill', 'holding', 'breath', 'sylvia', 'rose', 'totnes', 'devon', 'good', 'hear', 'michael', 'goves', 'condemnation', 'indefensible', 'practice', 'sending', 'child', 'live', 'away', 'home', 'local', 'authority', 'area', 'doe', 'mean', 'government', 'reverse', 'communitybusting', 'housing', 'benefit', 'reform', 'hitting', 'child', 'family', 'similarly', 'cruel', 'effect', 'francis', 'prideaux', 'london']",17
david cameron has a real problem with women not just a few women either those struggling on the benefits slashed by his coalition government say or the relatively affluent stayathome mothers who have lost child benefit according to a poll released this weekend support for the prime minister has fallen among young old rich and poor women in many ways the fact that of all women in the ipsos mori poll for mumsnet say they would vote for labour compared with just who would back the tories comes as no surprise the archive of this blog is a record of policies and pronouncements that have alienated women the coalitions first austerity budget which cut public services the lack of women in the cabinet and of course the occasional glimpses of sneering contempt from a man who believes we should all calm down dear three years ago of women may have backed the tories compared to for labour yet cameron appears to have become the very essence of an allmale political elite i dont think he understands any issues relating to normal not superrich people let alone women said one respondent cameron was deemed the most out of touch out of all three of the main party leaders even the wealthiest women in toplevel professional and executive roles were less likely than men in similar circumstances to vote tory and among younger women aged the gap widens to a significant point lead for labour this poll shows that all camerons efforts lacklustre though they may be to improve his standing among women have come to nowt he appointed an adviser on womens issues laura trott and then gave her education and childcare to look after as well suggesting that all women are mothers recent announcements on the sexualisation of children or safety on the internet is seen as a direct attempt to attract the mumsnet voters who were so important at the last election after three years things have got worse for cameron among women voters not better yet this latest poll at the start of party conference season provides little cheer for his main rivals for the job women appear to be supporting labour despite not because of its leader even with all the misgivings of respondents said they were more likely to like david cameron than ed miliband just and thought him more capable compared with the labour leader as far as women saying that they like politicians they would not vote for and consider out of touch id need time to recover from that before giving a verdict but this poll does show two things politicians are even more unpopular than their parties and women will be a key battleground in the election with no more than half of women believing that any of the three main party leaders are interested in the concerns and opinions of women all is left to play for cameron and his party are simply the most highprofile examples of a disenchantment with the whole political process and thats the real problem this article was amended on september the original version referred

look i have no idea who cathy mcgowan is and frankly neither do you we can probably be sure that the independent candidate for indi has eaten no children and was not the sole author of mein kampf this absence of doubt about absolute evil should be enough to celebrate her as the grassroots campaigner go cathy whoa cathy shes a little battler wholl usher good into the world i do however know who sophie mirabella is and so it seems do you until the federal election last saturday she was a coalition middleweight chiefly known for being a the executor of a rich mans will and b the object of hansards most peculiar insult if youve forgotten former mp belinda neal doubleddown on crazy to offer to a pregnant mirabella your child will turn into a demon if you have such evil thoughts youll make your child a demon youll make your child a demon it was the bestworst thing ever and could only have been improved if both parliamentarians were clad in tigerprint bikinis despite what is fess up a wretched lack of knowledge about both candidates proposals for the seat of indi we have nonetheless attributed to one a marian halo and to the other the capacity for producing a demon baby but can mirabella be so bad and vexing as your stupid facebook groups and your idiot opinion pieces suggest and if she is as seems to be the consensus on the lazyleft a warmongering succubus who reproduces hate with her devilvulva then where is the evidence consigned to the backbench in government mirabella never really had the chance to do anything more offensive than be a member of a terrible party which ruined my nation i will be among the first and most effusive flingers of poo at these monsters whose loathing for life has seen the dwindling of workplace rights and personal liberties but i will not earmark a particular turd for a woman yet to prove that she is as awful as say kevin andrews cited often as a proof of her nastiness is an appearance on qampa wherein she failed to resuscitate the guy from getup she should not be so harshly judged first i have appeared on qampa with mirabella in fact and those lights are very bright and confusing honestly nothing in that studio seems real least of all political conscience second hey if you thought you had half a chance to end clicktivism what would you do clearly i jest but i do hate getup beyond this television appearance the chief reason for disliking mirabella seems to be that she is just not very nice yes its true that she appeared before those ditch the witch signs but so did a whole lot of other guys yes its true that she boycotted the national apology to stolen generations but so did a whole lot of other guys and hey while were at it wheres the i hate jenny macklin page on facebook under her ministers watch the gap between indigenous and nonindigenous australians widened and the intervention abided but i guess she went to the bother of looking sorry and mirabella never did shes unapologetic and thats why you cant stand her the reeking fetid evil of her party notwithstanding mirabella is not unusually vile it is true that she does not bother to conceal her ignorance but this does not make her worse than her fellows frankly id rather the quadrantcrowd outed themselves in all their bravura stupidity if only john howard had been a little more candid in his partiality to the history of keith windschuttle for example maybe we wouldnt have had years under him mirabella is boldfaced and she is unabashed and she is not sorry and all of those other things we applaud in feisty ladies of the left i put it to you antimirabellists that you are less than equal opportunity in your enthusiastic hate,2013-09,look idea cathy mcgowan frankly neither probably sure independent candidate indi ha

online dating sites are not doing enough to protect women from being targeted by stalkers and men convicted of domestic violence according to a new antistalking charity paladin which was set up two months ago to offer counselling to stalking victims says it has received requests for urgent help from women after they met men online who subsequently became abusive towards them the claim comes as the online dating industry launches a new code and kitemarking system designed to bolster confidence among clients it follows a series of serious data breaches when personal information was stolen by hackers causing fears that personal information could find its way into the hands of stalkers the concerns are one of the few black clouds hanging over what is a booming industry one in five dates now starts via the internet and there are hundreds of sites operating in the uk in an industry now worth m a year paladin launched on july said it had received a number of referrals from women who had met men online the charity said at least three of the referrals involved threats and actual violence in each case the men all had previous histories of violence against women paladin said it was extraordinary that a lack of regulation meant abusive men could keep joining dating sites it said anyone who was found to be involved in stalking or violence should be barred from all dating agencies and the matter referred to the police it also said it was worried about the vulnerability of online dating sites being hacked over recent months there have been a number of online data protection breaches involving some of the most popular dating sites said paladins cofounder harry fletcher personal information about women has been hacked and stolen this is frightening if such information fell into the hands of predatory sex offenders or stalkers the consequences would be horrific agencies must take all steps necessary to keep data safe and in the event of any future theft inform all clients immediately a combination of lack of regulation means anybody could create a new site this week and data theft is of grave concern and needs government intervention without delay in july last year it emerged that million users of the eharmony website had their passwords stolen and posted on a russian forum dedicated to passwordcracking george kidd the chief executive of the new online dating association said the establishment of a regulatory body showed the industry was determined to clamp down on those who sought to abuse the medium he said the challenge or difficulty with a community of people in their millions is how do we make it safe and secure how do we have the right culture to match the requirement of customers what do we believe our values to be kidd said it was important that dating sites did not duck the issue we will address identity and data and protection he said but we have a great deal of work to do everyone must have appropriate policies in place rather than a prescriptive set of rules june not her real name met her former partner on a free dating website and was unaware he had two convictions for abh about four weeks in the abuse started june said but as ive come to learn like many people convicted of domestic violence he could be very charming and he lured me back the abuse was not violent although junes partner was prone to throwing crockery and pots and pans he would say he could ruin me june said unbeknown to me he had taken naked photographs of me and he threatened to publish this on facebook and show them to my employer june called for dating sites to add a panic button that would make it easier for users of dating sites to report concerns about people they had met my site just had an automated response you really need a human being sitting there and taking your concerns seriously she said kidd insisted that it was safer meeting someone through a dating agency than just meeting someone in the pub it is now increasingly normal for people to find their partners online and our role in identifying best practice across the industry will make it easier for people to know what to expect kidd said consumers will be able to look out for the hallmark logo which verifies that the site is a member of the association and operating to these industry standards,2013-09,online dating site enough protect woman

if only men ran feminism we wouldnt be in the mess we are in we wouldnt have to worry about offending them or arguing among ourselves we would simply take instruction from consultants on gender struggle only the prettiest would be allowed to fight the gender jihad and we would have to do it topless you cant make this stuff up and i am not it turns out that that femen the ukrainian feminist group known for seminaked media stunts slogan our mission is protest our weapons are bare breasts was actually founded by a man victor svyatski it gets weirder this man hand picked attractive women knowing they would make the front pages and they did many feminists were disturbed by the imperialist implications that these stereotypical blondes had no relationship with the culture or ethnicity of those they choose to bare their breasts to they have caused offence in many ways and indeed have been a disappointment to their great leader these girls are weak they dont have the strength of character instead they show submissiveness spinelessness lack of punctuality and many other factors which prevent them from becoming political activists yes women are so useless we cant even get out tops off in the right way who knows how we ever got the vote this whole ridiculous tale is symptomatic of the huge muddle around mens relationship to feminism obviously men can be feminists as i often say they can walk alongside us just not ahead and take charge of the whole shebang increasingly though to talk about genderspecific issues invokes cries of misandry from the what about the men brigade according to some anyone who mentions breast cancer therefore doesnt care about prostate cancer anyone who mentions domestic violence doesnt care that men are victims of violence too female genital mutilation what about circumcision and so it goes ludicrously on as though any woman speaking about these issues does not have sons fathers lovers to be accused of misandry hating all men when sometimes one is merely trying to stick up for some women is really tedious i dont hate all men give me time of course men suffer and men who hit women are likely to hit other men women who are violent to men are likely to hit their children none of this exists in isolation its the links that matter this week for example activists who amazingly kept their clothes on were asking whether there is a connection between trolling online stalking and actual violence against women womens aid workers are reporting that there is immediately the what about the men brigade suggests that somehow this means we dont care when men are killed the battering ram of misandry is another attempt to silence debate it is misguided it operates from the assumption that we are all on a level playing field i say tomato you say tomateoh i say misogyny you say misandry what is missing here is any analysis of patriarchy or indeed global reality one may argue that the construction of patriarchy is just natural women are weaker and have babies or that it is cultural and therefore changes as technology and contraception alters what is purely natural either way it produces a multifaceted system in which men at the top are the most advantaged the spectrum of privilege is huge there is a world of difference between not being able to get a buggy on to a bus and being raped and then stoned to death having seen patriarchy described as a conspiracy theory that blames all men even decent men for all womens woes it is almost possible to believe there is a conspiracy to focus on the problems of a few white middleclass women in order to strip feminism of its global reach and significance the cri de coeur remains why bang on about gender just leave it the problem of inequality must lie elsewhere that place where decent men do not have to ask too many questions not everything is reducible to gender but it is a factor whether we are talking about the failure of workingclass boys in education or the resurgence of the taliban gender is inextricable in almost every discussion we have about power those strange groups of men who feel so disempowered by any mention of feminism reveal themselves time and time again and indeed some of them really are not doing well at all you see patriarchy is a system that also oppresses men at the bottom or according to jung keeps men unable to fully mature talk of internalised privilege means nothing to them they behave as though the country is run by andrea dworkin gideon has been ousted in favour of angela davis and theresa may has been replaced by bjrk that radical feminism didnt actually happen and is nowhere near the levers of power seems to have bypassed them when we ask for concrete examples of misandry we are usually given some representations in pop culture that show men as inadequate fathers or rapists and murderers but i missed that coup when women took over the entire media do let me know about it using feminism as a scapegoat fuels the backlash so does this bandying about of misandry every time a women speaks up misandry will be equivalent to misogyny only when women are equal to men there are no blurred lines here this article was

crime rate down is usually a headline that brings cheer forgive me then for raining on this particular parade though because the news that the police are referring fewer cases of domestic violence to prosecutors is no cause for celebration at all why crimes of violence against women are among the most underreported in this country evidence from refuge suggests that two women are killed in domestic violence every week and that one in four women suffer violent abuse the stern review on rape reporting suggested that only of rapes even get reported to the police spurred on by these figures as well as horrific cases of women failed by the system such as maria stubbings police forces and prosecutors have worked hard in recent years to encourage victims to come forward and to change the way they are treated by authorities once they do so although the system is still far from perfect these efforts appear to have resulted in some change domestic violence cases reported to the police have increased by nearly once those cases are referred to prosecutors the chances of convictions have also increased in the year to march convictions for domestic violence cases rose to not far behind the average for other violent crime and up from in when such crimes were typically treated as just a domestic and therefore too tricky to bother with yet despite the increase in the number of women reporting crimes to the police the police are referring far fewer cases go figure given the kudos he gets when politically controversial conviction rates go up you would think that the director of public prosecutions keir starmer would be delighted that fewer cases were being referred to his team possibly suggesting that they are the cases police consider most likely to succeed but he isnt in an interview in july he revealed real alarm at early signs from his own service that the number of cases were falling there are more domestic violence cases out there than are reported to the police he said i would be slow to accept that the incident rate in this kind of crime has gone down indeed starmer who is to stand down as dps in october is to meet police forces this month in a bid to understand the decline in the referred cases of rape domestic violence and child abuse so why are figures going down shadow home secretary yvette cooper and her team who have gathered the data on domestic violence reports believe the decline in the number of cases being referred which started at the end of and accelerated in the subsequent two years is due to government cuts the home secretary has cut policing by and now we are seeing the consequences she says and she has failed to set out a strategy to make sure action on domestic violence isnt cut as a result the home secretary is hollowing out the police service and victims of crime are suffering as a result labour makes much of the fact that the number of cases of domestic violence referred to the cps by the police rose between however its fair to point out that this was from a low base the drop that started at the end of also came after cuts had started under the outgoing labour party with swingeing cuts across all public services money is unlikely to be the answer anyway what is almost more worrying is the sense that attitudes on domestic violence are again shifting with police officers pursuing only certain cases to all those who argue that this is what police officers do in all crimes it is worth pointing out that few crimes suffer from so many myths and stereotypes as violence against women where victims are often treated as complicit in their abuse and somehow culpable my god even a yearold girl was described as predatory and therefore responsible for the fact that she was sexually active with a year old man who walked free last month we need a national strategy to tackle these sorts of attitudes and a desire to bring about consistency in every police force area this isnt a story of

there has been an alarming fall in the number of domestic violence attacks that are considered for prosecution since official figures reveal the figures obtained by labour in a freedom of information request show that the number of domestic violence cases being referred by the police to the crown prosecution service to be considered for charge and prosecution has fallen from in in england and wales to in the shadow home secretary yvette cooper said the figures which have been analysed by the house of commons library show that after years of improvement the system was now badly failing domestic violence victims with fewer offences being charged and prosecuted despite levels of domestic violence increasing she said that the alarming fall coincided with the loss of police officers from the cut in whitehall funding for the police which had affected their ability to investigate and bring criminals to justice the cps figures show that the number of domestic violence cases referred by the police rose by between and the latest available cps data shows that the number of domestic violence incidents reported by victims to the police rose from in to in the fresh evidence will add urgency to the decision by the cps and the home office to launch an inquiry into why police forces are reporting fewer cases of rape domestic violence and child abuse than they were two years ago the outgoing director of public prosecutions keir starmer is to meet senior police chiefs later this month to discuss whether the police are doing enough to bring cases to court the overall fall in the number of domestic violence cases being referred to the cps masks some even sharper falls in some parts of the country they show that there has been a drop in manchester and a drop in norwich while forces such as gwent and essex have consistently improved their referral rate since cooper said these are shocking and disturbing figures theresa may claimed in she was pursuing a unique opportunity to bring about real change on domestic violence instead these figures show things have gone backwards and she is failing badly she said that while the number of cases reported to the police has increased by nearly the vast majority of police forces have cut the number of cases they refer for prosecution by that means one in five perpetrators who would previously have been charged are now getting away with it and this big drop in referrals has all happened since the police cuts started referrals and prosecutions were going up before the election but now fewer police officers are referring fewer domestic violence cases for prosecution and victims are being let down as a result said cooper shadow home office minister stella creasy said that the massive declines in the referral rates in some parts of the country were a real cause for concern but the lack of any monitoring meant that the home secretary should be urgently asking police forces for an explanation victims and survivors need to be equally confident in the criminal justice system regardless of where they live but these figures suggest a postcode lottery could be developing when it comes to domestic violence said creasy with cuts to policing and specialist services it is vital we ensure forces have the resources and the expertise to act and a commitment to take this all the way to convictions a cps spokesperson said the reasons for fewer cases being referred to the cps by police is not something we are currently in a position to speculate on however together with the home office we are looking into the possible reasons for this and the dpp is hoping to meet with national policing leads in the coming weeks to discuss the issue a home office spokesperson defended the governments record on tackling violence against women and girls saying nearly m had been ringfenced for specialist local domestic and sexual violence support services and protection for victims had been strengthened through the pilot of clares law domestic violence rape and sexual offence prosecutions have reached their highest ever conviction rate for the second year running so the systems in place to protect women are working despite the necessary cuts to police budgets she saidbut there is still much to do we are actively pursuing ways in which we can prevent domestic and sexual violence happening in the first place encourage more victims to come forward and improve the police response we wont stop until we have eradicated these appalling crimes for good,2013-09,ha alarming fall number domestic

getting in early to help families and children in trouble is among the most useful things a government can do so nick cleggs speech promising a doubling of nursery places for twoyearolds from this time next year is welcome in principle but since september mr clegg has had to work alongside an education minister liz truss with a notoriously narrow focus on affordability mr clegg won the argument with her over increasing the staffchildren ratio in nurseries and with childminders but it is not clear that he has found the cash to be confident there will be enough places in the right locations for the twoyearolds who this month became entitled to free earlyyears learning let alone the same number again next year it is not enough that the deputy prime ministers heart is in the right place if he cant get the money to make it happen when the national audit office examined funding for the programme for free places for three and fouryearolds last year after the coalition expanded the programme to include of the age band it found that behind impressive overall takeup were yawning variations within the figures the most disadvantaged children were consistently least likely to be at a school or nursery because in the places where they lived there werent enough of them that is an ill omen for the extension of the scheme to the of most disadvantaged twoyearolds particularly since the funding is rightly available only to nurseries and childminders classed as good or outstanding by ofsted providers such as the charitable preschool learning alliance fear there wont be enough staff to meet the needs of toddlers from difficult backgrounds the very ones with most to gain from the scheme last year more than a hundred nurseries either closed or failed to open to meet expected demand because of anxiety about costs in london where the family and childcare trust has surveyed provision places will have to be provided by next september to meet mr cleggs commitment meanwhile local authorities closed sure start nurseries after the coalition ended the obligation to provide allday nursery care blaming a shortage of demand now they arent available to meet the demand that is good childcare is expensive and the early years are so very important the government likes to boast of the sectors dynamism another way of saying nurseries come and go depending on what moneys available where it might help keep costs to a minimum but this is an area of government activity that more than most others cries out for a coherent strategy to improve quality availability and affordability

im writing this piece on childcare while entertaining my new baby and toddler nick cleggs rehashed announcement on childcare funding for twoyearolds isnt nearly as entertaining as colouring in or playing peekaboo but it has made me think that its time for us to stop playing with our toys and make the economic case for universal childcare it is welcome news that of disadvantaged twoyearolds will be able to access hours of free childcare provision from next september however this is just a drop in the ocean as to what parents need given the losses theyve seen under this government families face a triple whammy childcare crisis of the governments own making with prices rising faster than inflation places plummeting due to the slashing of supplyside funding and cuts to financial help with childcare costs through working tax credit the governments latest taxfree childcare announcement will help the richest the most and according to the resolution foundation could see the income of poorer families cut its time for government to stop tinkering and take childcare seriously we see business case after business case for boys toys like planes and trains highspeed rail and airport expansion government should develop the case for childcare as a key economic driver to get women and it is still mainly women back into work and earning their full potential to benefit not only families but also the country the case for free universal childcare should be seriously explored the ippr has shown that universal childcare hours of free childcare for children from one to four would pay a return to the exchequer of over four years in terms of tax revenue minus the cost of childcare for every woman who returns to work full time after a year of maternity leave childcare investment would not only get our economy moving it would also help the development of young children and begin to level the playing field between poorer children and their peers when they start school childcare policy should be taken more seriously by the treasury and department for business innovation and skills bis the minister for education and childcare elizabeth truss should work across both the department for education and bis making sure childcare is firmly on the growth agenda and employers and businesses are working to offer genuinely flexible working and shared parental leave that works for parents and employers local enterprise partnerships should be working with local government to make the local case for improved childcare as an infrastructure necessity as they do for transport we wont get more women back to work and our economy moving until we make a strong case for a radical extension of childcare support its time we shouted louder for real help now for families

child will already be behind their better off classmate before a single lesson has been taught without this help children suffer and the whole class suffers as teachers have to focus more of their efforts on children who are frustrated and left behind through no fault of their own the offer of free childcare to of toddlers has already been announced by the government but this is the first time

if you dont know what misandry is where have you been the fun youve been missing misandry is hatred of contempt for and ingrained prejudice against men as a term it has risen in prominence as a slamdunk riposte to the term misogyny these days every time someone talks about misogyny they are usually accused of being a misandrist especially if they are female it doesnt matter if you dont think you are one if its a simple case of mistaken identity the first time it happened to me i didnt even know what it meant i had to look it up in those days misogyny was mainstream misandry was very niche now its everywhere just about anyone can be called a misandrist its not special any more those who make it their business to seek out misandry have done a sterling job of finding it just about everywhere and by doing so popularising and formalising the concept misandry goes the cry every time concerns are raised about say domestic violence parliamentary representation paygaps all those manhating classics however while misandry exists because everything exists it will always be small fry compared to misogyny it will never make it into the big leagues its not just that misandry hasnt got the numbers it also hasnt got the rage male rage takes many forms and one is misogyny its not the same as anger from either gender which comes and goes male rage seems to be as cold and calculated as it is horribly permanent while of course women get pissed off with men ive never known a woman to carry that chilling aura of compressed permarage against the opposite sex that hangs around certain men the relentlessly churning core of hostility condescension entitlement and resentment only last week a study from the university of florida said that men are far more likely to secretly want their wives or girlfriends to fail to be less successful than they are because it boosts their own sense of selfworth it said that men were more likely to feel threatened when their partner succeeded preferring them to fail and this remained true in more equal societies such as holland by contrast however well or otherwise their partner is doing had no effect on a womans selfesteem well this feels new the male competitive streak was always presumed to be about the workplace now it seems that dog eat dog has not only gone intergender it has invaded personal relationships what does this mean when increasing numbers of women are the main if not sole breadwinners could it be affecting those figures of recessionrelated domestic violence women bearing the brunt of male frustration when ironically women are often cited as the worst affected by the recession is this going to be another sign of these hard times the rise of the threatened permaenraged male is it even possible to debate this without the predictable zombiedrone of misandry after all here is a study about male rage swirling around women everywhere even in their personal lives how else would you describe these men needing women to fail to make themselves feel better while curiously women supposedly such big manhaters need no such thing see what i mean about small fry misogyny outguns misandry every time in this one way in terms of entrenched cold rage women are unequal pathetically we cant even muster up enough bile to resent our partners success those who cling to misandry as if it were the sex wars holy grail are going to have to face it women just arent up to the task of hating men as much as imaginatively and as permanently as some of them hate us simon simon we get it we just dont believe it like me youre probably enjoying the shots of simon cowell succumbing to the curse of opda just like regular public displays of affection but overdone with it recently the x factor mogul and his pregnant ladylove lauren silverman have been snapped enjoying kisses cuddles and adoring gazes on outside tables in st tropez nice and london one such table was a branch of caf rouge which is strange as cowell usually favours celebrity hangout the ivy when in blighty cowell also tends to sit inside rather than outside restaurants moreover the last time he tried kissing in public with thenfiancee mezhgan hussainy it had all the romantic urgency of dental flossing but here he is smooching with silverman and she only has his head in a determined vicelike grip for a few of the photos were chuffed for them arent we arent we you curmudgeonly lot however everyone knows besotted couples tend to stay in snuggling cooing and watching rock box sets they certainly dont sit in pavement caffs looking entranced while paps take photos while cowell has rolled rather well with the shockpregnancy news he needs to curb the opda why mileys knickers got us in a twist well what to say about miley cyruss raunchfest with robin thicke at the mtv video music awards i havent seen such demonic tonguewaggling since linda blair in the exorcist when did elastoplast start making matching knickers and bras if cyrus was trying to bury her child star past she definitely managed it digging a graveyard plot in the sprawling celebcemetery of trying too hard yes miley we realise that youre all grown up congratulations on achieving full sexual maturity no one ever managed it before more seriously why has cyrus been internationally slutshamed never mind the lengthy popcultural history of female shockperformance madonna was wandering around starkers for her sex book over two decades ago never mind that thicke was also there moronically grinding away giant foam fingers aside cyruss twerking wriggles of her bottom were nicked straight from black culture rap hiphop rampb etc and while its true that artists have been criticised for all the hoing and bitching it says something that the world really goes crazy when a white girl does it it seems that certain people have been too pcshy too jumpy about being accused of racism to criticise overt sexism fine but then its hypocritical for these same people to suddenly become censorious when a young white woman is involved this sort of thing has long been a staple of music videos so its nonsensical to have global outrage when someone like cyrus does it especially as its long been routine for black females to be degraded in the same way this is entertainment racism double standards of the most brazen kind rihanna had to get beaten to a pulp to get the worlds full

said it was much colder than they would have liked while said their home suffered from damp or mould there are over three million children living in poverty in the uk a figure that is predicted to rise poverty remains stigmatising according to the survey of children aged between and published on tuesday of those who said that their family was not well off said they had felt embarrassed and had experienced some form of bullying as a result matthew reed the chief executive of the childrens society said for millions of children up and down the country poverty is a grinding reality and it is getting worse many families are facing stark and unacceptable choices like heat or eat this is disgraceful in any country especially in one of the worlds richest the charity is launching a childrens commission on poverty to record the experiences of children living beneath the breadline a separate survey published on tuesday shows that greater numbers of disadvantaged families are using the services offered by local childrens centres despite continuing local government funding cuts the research published by the charity children which runs family and childrens services across britain revealed that although of childrens centres say they worked with an increasing number of families over the past months are operating on a decreased budget compared with the previous year about a third expect to be able to provide fewer services in a years time anne longfield chief executive of children said the past months have seen existing pressures on families mounting with increasing strain on job security household finances relationships and widespread anxiety over the potential impact of further austerity cuts to local support services local authorities are under extreme financial pressure to make tough decisions she said but rather than contemplating reductions and closures we should instead seize the opportunity to make the most of centres growing potential to help avert family crises a spokesman for the department for work and pensions said despite paying out bn in tax credits alone the previous government failed to meet their target to halve child poverty by and far too many children were left behind while this government is committed to eradicating child poverty we are taking a new approach by finding the root causes of the problem and tackling these we have successfully protected the poorest from falling behind and last year we saw a reduction of children in workless poor families our welfare reform programme and tax changes will further increase work incentives and improve the lives of some of the poorest families in our communities the introduction of the universal credit will make three million households better off and lift up to children out

has long been recognised as key to our economic infrastructure theres a fastgrowing group for whom no such election pledges have been aimed the sandwich generation those who carry the dual responsibility of caring for young children alongside elderly or disabled relatives according to a yougov poll there are an estimated million sandwich carers in the uk and the number is steadily rising people are living longer and more women are having children later in life while pursuing careers rising tuition fees and rising house prices are also keeping children at home for longer charity carers uk say around a fifth of to yearolds are actively supporting parents while their children are still at home for many juggling these caregiving roles is putting both financial and personal strain on the family and it is predominantly women who are more likely to bear the brunt childcare is seen as fundamental to business and the economy but if you move up the age spectrum provision is about years behind says emily holzhausen director of policy for carers uk for sandwich carers poor quality uncoordinated care hoovers up time and energy and the labour market loses valuable people while multigenerational multiresponsibility caregiving can be rewarding and many families want to care for loved ones the downsides are all too evident women are more likely to give up work in order to cope and more likely to suffer anxiety and depression as they give their lives over to caring carers uks own research showed women are four times more likely to care for more than hours a week than men and more likely to reach breaking point nobody knows this better than catriona mcroberts who lives in east kilbride and looks after three children alongside her yearold mother her youngest son kieran is autistic and her mother who lives in nearby sheltered accommodation now suffers with vascular dementia a disease caused by problems with blood supply to the brain i dont sleep properly because im up with kieran most nights and first thing in the morning i check my mum is okay she depends on me to live and if shes unwell i have to pop in several times a day as well as care for three children who are aged six and five and who go to three separate schools i yearn for a day when i can just clean the house or pay bills said the yearold who adds that holidays are out of the question while catrionas husband works as a selfemployed financial adviser she has given up her job with strathclyde police to care fulltime i went parttime when i had kids but when i began caring for my mum i didnt want to be the person who brings their private stresses into work in the end i gave up work completely because it didnt offer the flexibility i needed i feel guilty because the time spent with my mother is time away from my son and vice versa the worst thing is that i know my situation is not unique as a society we just dont support carers she says there are different permutations of catrionas story nationwide but many dual carers who include a swelling number of working grandparents say simple things such as help with domestic chores would alleviate some of the strain however the need for continuity of quality care remains a predominant frustration catriona for example has to deal with two different social workers one for her mother and one for her son and sees a multitude of nhs staff coordinating different appointments and constantly having to repeat her backstory to new workers is draining she admits dual carers will often find themselves struggling financially too having been forced to give up work they are entitled to one carers allowance per family currently per week regardless of the number of dependents with substantial caring needs in a recent report the institute of public policy research ippr looked to other european countries for more carerfriendly policies in germany for example one incomesmoothing scheme called familienpflegezeit family caring time means eligible employees can reduce their working time to a minimum of hours for up to two years to care for a loved one on return to work they continue on reduced pay to pay back that time but retain their pension entitlements throughout according to emily holzhausen only a handful of companies such as british gas and sainsburys are starting to recognise that carers have unique needs but the majority of employers lag far behind the ippr report has attracted some interest from the opposition and the organisation is hopeful that the coalition and employers will also take notice translating that into workable policy and practice however means theres a long way to go the issue of care is slowly chipping away and entering the public debate in a different way says ippr associate

i led a campaign this year asking the bank of england to keep a woman on its banknotes following its success i was treated to a tour of the dark depths of twitter which unleashed a torrent of graphic and violent rape and death threats upon me in an interview naomi wolf referred to this implying that i had retreated to my parlour when things got difficult this irritated me because the one thing i didnt do was retreat in fact i did exactly what wolf says i should have done i did lean in i did adopt my warrior pose and my god did i shout back i shouted i screamed i yelled i bloody pushed and then i broke which is why i came off twitter for most of september i dont think having a breakdown was a good outcome the other day i read a brilliant article in wired by laura hudson called die like a man the toxic masculinity of breaking bad the name says it all really to be a man in breaking bad you keep pushing you keep providing dominating overpowering until you break until you die and its not just in breaking bad yes the show takes it to extremes but this is a masculinity we all recognise and its one that is celebrated its one that is contrasted with the pussydom of femininity and this is the problem with wolfs comments and comments like hers they leave no room for humanity those words say that all the women who contacted me during those awful weeks to say that they had suffered the same to say that they had been silenced that they had been driven underground by fear those words say that those women were wrong that they were weak that they were letting the movement down so wolfs words arent feminist strong claim i know but to be fair to wolf its an easy trap to fall into its the trap of a society that says to be a man you have to be inhuman its the trap of a society that places that inhuman masculinity on the highest pedestal we have and its a trap that feminists should be trying to avoid wolf is right to say that feminists will come in for abuse we always have and until we live in an equal society we always will but she is wrong to imply that we should therefore just suck it up shes wrong because its defeatist we should be outraged by abuse we should flag it up say its wrong challenge it try to stop it but more than this shes wrong because sucking it up is part of that privileging of a masculinity that doesnt even serve men let alone women as a society we need to grow up and get out of the playground there is nothing inherently admirable about refusing to acknowledge emotion and psychological limitations we all have them to deny them as wolfs way of thinking does is not only unhealthy its also unrealistic and its egotistical part of the point of having a feminist movement rather than a feminist solo enterprise is that its not just about one persons drive for success glory and power its about all of us standing together and fighting and you know what that means it means that when one of us falls when one of us needs a timeout when one of us has led a battle and is under attack the rest of us can step in and take over we even have a word for it its called sisterhood,2013-10,led campaign year asking bank england keep woman banknote

the governments social mobility and child poverty commission called for an end to longterm youth unemployment by increasing learning and earning opportunities in its first report on child poverty in the uk while news coverage tended to focus upon the reports findings on household income the recommendations about learning and earning opportunities outside of the home warrant equal attention as children grow up their ability to develop and progress in life is affected by a myriad social environments the schools they go to the peer groups they form the neighbourhoods within which they live all will influence a range of things including their emotional wellbeing and their sense of safety for example if a child is in a nurturing school environment with a supportive group of friends and within a neighbourhood where there are other learning and development opportunities they have a great chance of progressing through adolescents in terms of child poverty their wealth of opportunities outside of the home are critically important this may all seem and probably is obvious however in current debates about youth unemployment and child poverty it can often be forgotten i was struck by this gap at a local authority event i attended recently organised to raise professional awareness of child sexual exploitation so that individuals working there are better equipped to spot the signs of abuse and protect children as a result at the end of the session attendees were given the opportunity to ask questions and one said the challenge we have here is that we see kids in school or we see them in a youth offending team we have nothing in between no safety net to identify children and offer early help we have no youth service after her statement the room went silent and while most of the attendees agreed with her nobody could offer a solution it was true in that innercity local authority the youth service had been completed decimated over the past eight months the neighbourhood was one where learning opportunities were shrinking if not disappearing and a poverty of opportunity was emerging many professionals are frustrated that they are working in an environment in which children are only offered additional support or services when things have gone drastically wrong so children are either in a youth offending service or a drug and alcohol misuse service or they have reached a threshold where a social worker is intervening in their lives the debate about child poverty often occurs as distinct and separate from pledges to improve early intervention with children and young people the former being about the home and the latter being about service provision in fact they are not mutually exclusive we need to listen to professionals and move on from anecdotes moreover an urgent assessment of the level of loss of youth services across the uk is required to ascertain which children are growing up in a neighbourhood where poverty of support and opportunity may also impact on social mobility in the future if we continue to close youth services we will also lose our ability to intervene early with children who need support and to build their resilience and poverty of opportunity will persist,2013-10,government social mobility child poverty commission called end longterm youth unemployment increasing learning earning opportunity first report child

dr aric sigman at a conference convened by mothers at home matter if you want a clue as to its agenda i refer you to the name warned of the rise of motherism a prejudice against stayathome mothers sigman is well known for his retraditionalising intentions to which end he has been accused of misrepresenting behavioural and neurological evidence a claim he has denied so he says motherism is dangerous because it puts women off being stayathome mothers which is the developmental ideal id reject the second part of the argument but not the first there is a prejudice against stayathome mothers there is a presentation of women who look after their own children full time as airheaded spoilt and dowdy however there is also a prejudice against women who look after their children but arent dowdy yummy mummies women who go back to work after having had children women who stay out of work but also employ nannies women who work parttime and look after their children the rest of the time i think the only way you could gain approval for your timemanagement as a mother would be to look after your children all the time as well as working fulltime but for some socially useful enterprise ideally voluntary work while never relying on a man for money yet never claiming benefits either but god forbid that you should have a private income mothers in society act as whipping boys for almost all other social fissures oh the irony of there being no female equivalent for the phrase whipping boy when it is almost always a female oh the sidespitting irony here are four examples of motherisms at work what they say i dont see why mothers need these enormous buggies if you were pushing anyone who couldnt walk but wasnt a baby people would happily put themselves out a bit the act of pushing a baby however confers an aura of smugness about you look at you so in love with your baby that makes it unthinkable to just help you out theres an element of sense in this mothers are in love with their babies for the most part and they would see you step into a puddle just to avoid the smallest jolt to their airsprung sleeping chariot but its not the end of the sodding world is it mothers temporarily losing their social etiquette while they fall in love with their babies what they say at the school gates whispered you never see the mother even if the child is dropped off by the father there is very little quarter given to the mother who isnt visible to the childs social circle and not much consideration of the possibility that maybe her work starts at am precisely so she can get home by pm i personally think this is a freudian throwback the resentment of children of the s and s who were the first generation having to contend with bloody maternal noshows at the harvest festival its the only rationale i can think of for why a person would think it was any of their business how a mother organised her time what they say going in to a cafe during the hours of standard economic activity look at all these women who dont work i wish i could afford not to work i personally think the greatest misconception around childcare shared by a huge proportion of the adult population the people whove never done it plus people whove done it but cant remember it is that it is easy it is by far the most demanding job conceived by society wringing you out like a blooddrenched bedsheet each day leaving you physically drained and mentally poleaxed without even the energy to close your own mouth or hold your head upright often making an involuntary gargling noise some of its quite fun but anyway thats an aside theres no economic sense to this question if the women drinking coffee werent looking after their children someone else would have to which would in most cases cost as much as their wages so what people are really objecting to is not that mothers can afford not to work but that they can still afford coffee what they say i never have anything to say to these yummy mummies dressed up as a deficiency of the speaker i never have anything to say it is actually a charge levelled at the mother that she has no interests why because being yummy she is narcissistic and cant see beyond pilates and brazilian hot waxing the true resentment is of her wealth that her life isnt one of drudgery and servitude but spa treatments and interiors well thats fine its possible to make a good case for objecting to wealth since so much of it is unjustly come by but at least object to the people unjustly coming by it it seems a little tangential to make the wife the object of the opprobrium all shes done is have a kid and fancy up her pubic area,2013-10,dr aric sigman conference convened mother home matter want clue agenda refer name warned rise

three thousand the head of the childline schools service lee mitchell concedes is a big number but thats the number of volunteers childline a service provided by the nspcc will need for its latest push by it wants to be delivering assemblies and workshops in all primary schools across the uk teaching children how to recognise abusive behaviour report it and seek help so far around people have been trained up some of whom already volunteer for childline however because of the numbers needed the charity also needs to look further afield to fill the roles when you consider that volunteers are needed across every region of the uk rather than only close to particular urban centres its not such a daunting task says mitchell its very important for us that our volunteer network is reflective of the communities were reaching out to he says that means recruitment drives via local media and volunteering networks where potential applicants can get in touch with a local coordinator are crucial understandably given the nature of the work training and assessment processes are rigorous those already recruited describe the training as supportive and highly enjoyable candidates must first come in for a group interview with a maximum of five others to assess their suitability as part of that theyll look at a case study to get them thinking about scenarios that could arise in schools and give a minute presentation on a subject of their choice individual interviews follow the majority of those attending move on to the next stage but if interviewers feel someone really isnt right for the role they will suggest other ways for the applicant to help childline if we see something in someone we feel we can develop we absolutely will says janet hinton the services area coordinator for milton keynes buckinghamshire and east berkshire but there are people who arent suitable and its important to us that the children we work with come first the next step is completing three online training modules covering child protection issues while childline carries out enhanced crb checks on applicants then there are two days of facetoface training in groups of to where participants get to grips with the education materials and work on presentation the sessions run by area coordinators and volunteers already working on the service also include further work on safeguarding former teachers and headteachers make up a significant group among volunteers but those who dont already have experience speaking to large groups of children are just as welcome and are given full support to build the necessary confidence and skills we dont expect everybody to be allsinging alldancing from day one says mitchell volunteers need to have the time to deliver an assembly and followup workshop to schools over a year parttime workers the retired students and shift workers like nurses are also wellrepresented there are plans to talk to businesses about the benefits of giving staff volunteering time to get involved its not an easy thing standing up in front of children mitchell says it takes a lot of skill and i think theres some real added value for organisations if they commit to thinking their staff could be part of it former teacher and motherofthree sarah forbes found out about the schools service when she was looking for volunteering opportunities she could fit around her family life she signed up in and admits she was slightly daunted by the prospect of the interview but upon arrival she relaxed instantly it was incredibly welcoming forbes remembers the moment i got there i knew it was fine the training where participants worked together to build their skills was lovely and without a hint of competition all the volunteers and people training us were just amazing it was very much like we were all looking after each other forbes who practices her assemblies while walking around her house particularly enjoys the hourlong workshops these children actually seem so mature when you talk to them she says i absolutely love it alison paraskeva another volunteer was a teaching assistant for years and a school governor for the whole thing was so uplifting the yearold says of the training i couldnt wait to get into schools she describes the experience of delivering assemblies as fantastic empowering children is what its all about giving them an understanding of abuse in all its forms telling them its never their fault and helping them realise that whats happening to them maybe is not ok that they have a right to speak out talking openly about abuse in that way youre on the road to prevention since starting out in april paraskeva has so far worked in around schools the children she says seem to love the sessions they know a lot more about all the issues of abuse than i think people realise theyre totally captivated i think they get a huge amount from it for anyone who has the time needed paraskeva says she wouldnt hesitate to recommend volunteering for the service theres no greater reward than helping to change childrens lives for the better last month childline launched a m appeal to fund the service called now i know

cherie booth has written a frank account of the challenges she faced during her early years as tony blairs wife in which she had to combine the demands of motherhood with those of her professional career she reveals that as a barrister she noticed a change in her male colleagues attitude towards her when pregnant with her first child but as a selfconfessed stubborn scouser she said she was determined to prove she could have a career and a family life she was influenced she said by the experience of her mother who gave up acting to look after her children and when abandoned by her husband took a job in a fish and chip shop in some ways i was lucky she wrote in an essay to mark the th anniversary celebrations of the charity children the fact that barristers are selfemployed meant i was able to marinate while my older children were very young and it did not ultimately hold me back from having a successful legal career this was a sacrifice i was prepared to make to have a family booth admits that she bought into the long hours culture i was so intent as a young lawyer on beating the men at their own game that i didnt take any real maternity leave with my three younger children it is only looking back that i realise i wasnt beating the system but reinforcing it after the birth of her third child which she admits she thought would be her last she was able to move up a gear and take chances which she did by moving to a bigger chambers and later still forming my own chambers matrix as a working mother of four she recognises that over the past years changes in the availability of childcare have made it easier to juggle work and family life but argues that there are still too many barriers to mothers working she suggests expanding the mentoring programme that she supports through the cherie blair foundation for women those who are going back to work after having a child should be given special help through returnships that act like an apprenticeship in easing them back into the workplace support should also be given to parents who choose to care fulltime for their children and a scandinavian style of universal childcare should be made available to

life has changed beyond recognition for families over the last years one of the places of greatest change has been the workplace thirty years ago little more than half of women worked now of women return to work after having a baby more than of women and men use at least one form of flexible working and in of families mums and dads share the childcare equally looking back at my own life over the last years i can see that my experiences in were relatively untypical i was a woman in a predominantly male profession in the february i had a big break in my legal career when i appeared for the first time as a junior in a case for a trade union in the house of lords then in may i stood unsuccessfully in the general election as the labour candidate for the safe tory seat of thanet north in kent but in the july i discovered i was pregnant with our first child who was born in january after that nothing was the same again as my pregnancy became more visible i noticed a perceptible change in the attitude towards me of my colleagues who were all men i was by nature a stubborn scouser and was determined to prove i could have both a career and a family life my mother who gave up her career as an actress to look after my sister and me was abandoned by her husband and with no maintenance forthcoming took a job in a fish and chip shop to support us this experience as well as my professional ambition instilled in me a strong feeling that maintaining a career and a family life was both desirable and necessary in some ways i was lucky the fact that barristers are selfemployed meant that i was able to marinate rather than grow my practice while my older children were very young and it did not ultimately hold me back from having a successful legal career this was a sacrifice i was prepared to make to have a family but for other women of my generation the story was very different and many look enviously at the opportunities afforded to the generation that followed changes over the last years including increasing availability of childcare have undoubtedly made it easier for parents to juggle work and family life with a significant rise in the number of mothers in the workforce yet cultural assumptions about the roles of men and women in business and social arrangements have not caught up does it matter that years on progress has been so slow i believe the answer is a resounding yes failing to remove the barriers that help us make the most of everyones talents and potential is remarkably shortsighted for both societies and companies after all women who make up half the talent pool are as exam results show demonstrably the smarter half this is not just about numbers but also about the qualities that women can bring to decisionmaking as harriet harman the longstanding champion of these issues has pointed out the recklessness that helped spark the global economic crisis might have been prevented with more women at the top of our banks in her book lean in facebook coo sheryl sandberg advocates that women be prepared to move up a gear be more confident and take chances in their career something i did myself after the birth of my third and what i thought was to be my last child by taking the then rare step and moving to a bigger barristers chambers and later still forming my own chambers matrix but changing our society so our workplaces are truly open to the talents and life choices of women and indeed people of all backgrounds needs real leadership and effort certainly the culture of work needs to change lady thatcher was lauded for her ability to work hours a day compare this with the criticism nick clegg received from some commentators when he revealed last year that he sometimes takes his children to school and is therefore not at his desk at the crack of dawn every day indeed in a world of the blackberry remote access and wifi hotspots on every street corner it feels particularly outdated that much of our working culture is still dominated by the need to be at our desk for long hours of the day and let us be honest it is difficult not to think i survived the relentless longhours culture and it didnt do me any harm i was so intent as a young lawyer on beating the men at their own game that i didnt take any real maternity leave with my three younger children it is only looking back that i realise i wasnt beating the system but reinforcing it many of the big decisions over progression promotion and future career trajectory are taken when people are in their late twenties and thirties putting women at a huge disadvantage because this is the very time they are most likely to be having a break to have children that said the changes in maternity and paternity leave and the growth in availability of flexible working and childcare were all responses to these changes and are now part of the architecture of our daily lives as we look forward to the next years we need to see some equally big changes not just in structures or laws but in attitudes practices and approaches here are some practical suggestions for reforms that i believe are achievable and wont cost the earth first is the idea of mentoring programmes the positive impact that mentors can have on female entrepreneurs is something i have seen first hand from the work of the cherie blair foundation for women that i launched some years ago the foundation brings together mentors and wouldbe entrepreneurs across the world via the internet with the aim of giving more women the chance to run a successful business and with a regular income improve their familys quality of life as well as contribute to the development of their countrys economy mentees report improving confidence and most importantly real business success it may not be a new or radical idea but more women could really benefit from having someone to bounce ideas off discuss problems with and to encourage them to be ambitious and confident second helping families especially mothers back on the ramp into employment after having a baby or a stay at home period has to be a priority we should be learning from companies that have been blazing a trail on this agenda for years like kpmg one solution could be a returnership which would be like an apprenticeship but for those who have been out of the labour market due to caring responsibilities the businesses that get these measures right in a world in which human capital matters more and more will win the battle for talent third we need to think about what we can do to support parents who want to prioritise fulltime caring for a period when their children are young one measure government might consider is whether families with single earners who will not be eligible for the new taxfree childcare offer might be able to store up their entitlement for up to three years to use when the second earner reenters the labour market finally we need a longterm vision for achieving universal childcare provision for all parents but before then we all need to do more as individuals as employers and as a community to make space for people to make these choices and rejoice in diversity in family life as we all

the working poor have borne the brunt of the coalitions deficit reduction programme with pensioners getting off lightest according to the first annual reporton thursday of the governments social mobility commission chaired by alan milburn a former labour cabinet minister the report will intensify debate over squeezed living standards and whether tax cuts as proposed by the prime minister are the best way to help ease the pressure on earnings the commissions annual report delayed until after the party conference season is also expected to call for more help for the poor pointing out that taxfree childcare being provided by the government is not progressive and needs to be rethought the call for a rethink comes as the department for education consults on its proposals for taxfree childcare vouchers the resolution foundation thinktank has warned that families will be excluded from receiving any extra help if either parent is earning less than a year the threshold for paying income tax yet government proposals will give working parents who earn up to each extra funding to bring down their childcare bills parents on low incomes who earn enough to pay income tax will receive of their costs those families not paying tax will continue to receive an existing subsidy that falls far short of covering childcare costs for many leaving the lowest paid gaining nothing or even paying more than they earn for working extra hours it is likely that second earners usually mothers on low incomes working part time will also lose out current childcare bills average per hour a cost that has made it difficult for the poorest families to work their way out of poverty the resolution foundation research on which milburns social mobility commission has drawn finds that under universal credit many low income families who work beyond hours a week when free statefunded early years provision ceases face earning nothing or even face paying up to for every extra hour they work the resolution foundation has warned only families in the bottom of the income distribution will qualify for new help compared to million in the top by income a consortium led by barnardos is calling on the government to fund of childcare costs for all families on universal credit this would cost m and could be funded from the m set aside to fund childcare for higher income families they are hoping to receive direct backing from milburn when he publishes his report more broadly the report will fuel the debate about who has been benefiting in the recession and who is likely to do best from the recovery in a taste of the argument dr mary bousted general secretary of the association of teachers and lecturers atl said the state of the nation report will show quite clearly that the outlook for everyone except the superrich is bleaker than it has been for more than half a century the deadly cycle of poverty leading to educational underachievement followed by underemployment and then poverty of ambition for the next generation has now infected huge areas of society and the policies of this coalition government are making it much harder to break out of this cycle support for

as a feminist ive always assumed that by fighting to emancipate women i was building a better world more egalitarian just and free but lately ive begun to worry that ideals pioneered by feminists are serving quite different ends i worry specifically that our critique of sexism is now supplying the justification for new forms of inequality and exploitation in a cruel twist of fate i fear that the movement for womens liberation has become entangled in a dangerous liaison with neoliberal efforts to build a freemarket society that would explain how it came to pass that feminist ideas that once formed part of a radical worldview are increasingly expressed in individualist terms where feminists once criticised a society that promoted careerism they now advise women to lean in a movement that once prioritised social solidarity now celebrates female entrepreneurs a perspective that once valorised care and interdependence now encourages individual advancement and meritocracy what lies behind this shift is a seachange in the character of capitalism the statemanaged capitalism of the postwar era has given way to a new form of capitalism disorganised globalising neoliberal secondwave feminism emerged as a critique of the first but has become the handmaiden of the second with the benefit of hindsight we can now see that the movement for womens liberation pointed simultaneously to two different possible futures in a first scenario it prefigured a world in which gender emancipation went hand in hand with participatory democracy and social solidarity in a second it promised a new form of liberalism able to grant women as well as men the goods of individual autonomy increased choice and meritocratic advancement secondwave feminism was in this sense ambivalent compatible with either of two different visions of society it was susceptible to two different historical elaborations as i see it feminisms ambivalence has been resolved in recent years in favour of the second liberalindividualist scenario but not because we were passive victims of neoliberal seductions on the contrary we ourselves contributed three important ideas to this development one contribution was our critique of the family wage the ideal of a male breadwinnerfemale homemaker family that was central to stateorganised capitalism feminist criticism of that ideal now serves to legitimate flexible capitalism after all this form of capitalism relies heavily on womens waged labour especially lowwaged work in service and manufacturing performed not only by young single women but also by married women and women with children not by only racialised women but by women of virtually all nationalities and ethnicities as women have poured into labour markets around the globe stateorganised capitalisms ideal of the family wage is being replaced by the newer more modern norm apparently sanctioned by feminism of the twoearner family never mind that the reality that underlies the new ideal is depressed wage levels decreased job security declining living standards a steep rise in the number of hours worked for wages per household exacerbation of the double shift now often a triple or quadruple shift and a rise in poverty increasingly concentrated in femaleheaded households neoliberalism turns a sows ear into a silk purse by elaborating a narrative of female empowerment invoking the feminist critique of the family wage to justify exploitation it harnesses the dream of womens emancipation to the engine of capital accumulation feminism has also made a second contribution to the neoliberal ethos in the era of stateorganised capitalism we rightly criticised a constricted political vision that was so intently focused on class inequality that it could not see such noneconomic injustices as domestic violence sexual assault and reproductive oppression rejecting economism and politicising the personal feminists broadened the political agenda to challenge status hierarchies premised on cultural constructions of gender difference the result should have been to expand the struggle for justice to encompass both culture and economics but the actual result was a onesided focus on gender identity at the expense of bread and butter issues worse still the feminist turn to identity politics dovetailed all too neatly with a rising neoliberalism that wanted nothing more than to repress all memory of social equality in effect we absolutised the critique of cultural sexism at precisely the moment when circumstances required redoubled attention to the critique of political economy finally feminism contributed a third idea to neoliberalism the critique of welfarestate paternalism undeniably progressive in the era of stateorganised capitalism that critique has since converged with neoliberalisms war on the nanny state and its more recent cynical embrace of ngos a telling example is microcredit the programme of small bank loans to poor women in the global south cast as an empowering bottomup alternative to the topdown bureaucratic red tape of state projects microcredit is touted as the feminist antidote for womens poverty and subjection what has been missed however is a disturbing coincidence microcredit has burgeoned just as states have abandoned macrostructural efforts to fight poverty efforts that smallscale lending cannot possibly replace in this case too then a feminist idea has been recuperated by neoliberalism a perspective aimed originally at democratising state power in order to empower citizens is now used to legitimise marketisation and state retrenchment in all these cases feminisms ambivalence has been resolved in favour of neoliberal individualism but the other solidaristic scenario may still be alive the current crisis affords the chance to pick up its thread once more reconnecting the dream of womens liberation with the vision of a solidary society to that end feminists need to break off our dangerous liaison with neoliberalism and reclaim our three contributions for our own ends first we might break the spurious link between our critique of the family wage and flexible capitalism by militating for a form of life that decentres waged work and valorises unwaged activities including but not only carework second we might disrupt the passage from our critique of economism to identity politics by integrating the struggle to transform a status order premised on masculinist cultural values with the struggle for economic justice finally we might sever the bogus bond between our critique of bureaucracy and freemarket fundamentalism by reclaiming the mantle of participatory democracy as a means of strengthening the public powers needed to constrain capital for the sake of

the governments key pledge that work will always pay has been shattered after it emerged that under the new benefits system many of the uks poorest working families will lose money if they work longer hours the work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith has declared that the universal credit scheme will ensure that going into work always pays more than remaining on benefits however experts warn that the scheme will see a significant reduction in the financial support given to help the poorest workers cover the cost of childcare making it uneconomic for them to work more every child in the uk is currently entitled to hours a week of free early years provision during school terms once they reach the age of three the government is extending this to cover poorer twoyearolds but with childcare costs averaging an hour for children under two for many parents on low wages it does not pay to work additional hours recognising the problem the government is setting aside bn to help working parents afford childcare about is intended for families on universal credit the remaining will go to couples earning up to each however a big divide has emerged on the issue of which poorer families will receive the extra financial support under the new arrangement poor parents who earn enough to pay income tax will receive of their childcare costs but the poorest working parents those who earn less than a year the threshold for paying income tax will receive only the towards their childcare costs that they currently receive this group will typically include lone parents who are likely to be on zerohours contracts such as carers and supermarket shift workers independent thinktank the resolution foundation has suggested that as many as working families eligible for universal credit will miss out on the extra support as a result barnardos calculates that many of the poorest working families would be worse off if they worked extra hours the uks poorest families are being told that it always pays to strive while at the same time being cut out of plans that would make work genuinely pay a mixed message that does little to help them escape the poverty trap said neera sharma of barnardos the family and childcare trust is also warning of a double hit on the poorest families caused by the changes to housing benefit that accompany the rollout of universal credit it estimates that a typical parent in london buying hours of childcare each week currently receives a contribution from the state of about of the they have to pay leaving them with a shortfall of when they transfer to universal credit however the trust calculates that they will have to find an extra a week to meet the costs it seems profoundly unjust that the poorest working families will not qualify for any extra help with their childcare costs said jill rutter head of policy and research at the trust these families are often single parents who are struggling to balance family life and childcare with the desire to work and be a positive role model barnardos has joined forces with the child poverty action group the resolution foundation and charities gingerbread and working families in calling on the government to ensure every family on universal credit has of their childcare paid for barnardos estimates that the measure would cost m which it said could be funded out of the bn the government is putting aside for childcare support a dwp spokesman insisted the government was committed to helping more families off benefits universal credit will help families pay their childcare costs with families working

the right idea at the right moment if it works now though it would be bitterly ironic i am constantly looking for symptoms constantly having cognitive tests my nineyearold daughter wants to know when she can be tested because its hereditary and she looks like me i tell her that thats not how it works empathy is a political act it neutralises anger and rage can you be a feminist and still like shoes it feels like these kinds of questions have diverted feminist attention for so long that theyve stopped them doing anything else shopping is miserable thats an open secret we need to lay bare the ennui of consumerism feminism is a process its not a set of fixed ideas but a navigation between the personal and the political by changing something in yourself you change the world i see myself

male conservative mps are guilty of unconscious slights to women according to a senior tory mp who has called on the party to work harder to improve the position of women bernard jenkin whose wife anne runs the womenwin tory group that promotes women parliamentary candidates said the party must have zero tolerance over outdated attitudes towards women in an article for the house magazine the commons public administration select committee chair said the tory party tends to assume that women will deal with womens issues leaving the men to run the country jenkin wrote many of us tory men tend to feel that women can deal with womens issues so men can get on with running the country the quad are all men the national security council is overwhelmingly men the tory high command david cameron george osborne lynton crosby are all men only three out of on the party board are women most of the advisers and policy wonks are men and of course most mps will continue to be men it is going to take a long time to change all this so what else must we change jenkin said the party should start by examining its attitudes towards women he wrote we should look at how we all behave generously hosting a dinner to discuss prospects and tactics in the marginal seats lord ashcroft was asked by a woman mp about declining conservative support among women shut up and sit down was his response he was trying to make a joke of course but the need to make a joke speaks volumes about the anxiety provoked by the question the prime minister greeted a leading highprofile businesswoman who happens to be the wife of a major donor to the party by asking and where is x the husband the veteran tory mp whose father patrick jenkin was a member of margaret thatchers cabinet said every male member of the conservative party needs to modernise his thinking or risk being left behind we men are all guilty of such unconscious slights to women but women voters see it and feel it a business change programme would involve zero tolerance of such behaviour we have perhaps yet to understand what change in the conservative party really means it is not something the leadership does or women can do for us every

this week im on a cruise with the nation magazine as a guest of their feminist columnist jessica valenti its a weeklong lefty political event and its a cruise so the attendees are who youd expect retired liberals at nightly dinners we chat about the shutdown war and activism and every evening the older folks on the cruise lament the lack of politically active young people jessica and i are both feminists in our s who started feminist blogs a decade ago and whose work brings us in contact with extraordinary numbers of young people active politics and feminism but all that activism seems invisible to the retirees were meeting and the volunteerism done by older folks in the service of liberal causes we dont see that in our daytoday either generational gaps in politics and activism are nothing new but the increasing use of technology in activism seems to have exacerbated the age divide the people ive been talking to who are largely in their s s and s ask why were not out on the streets marching against syria intervention or student loans or encroachments on abortion rights they ask why more young people arent on the nation cruise we explain that while lots of younger activists do protest in the streets just look at occupy wall street many of us focus our activism and political engagement online and in a nation where much of our personal communication and professional work happens over the internet cyberspace is no longer separable from real life twitter campaigns and online petitions when done well can be as politically effective as largescale marches the feminist blogosphere where jessica and i both got our start writing is teeming with bright young activists who vote volunteer for planned parenthood work for progressive politicians and staff liberal organizations the success of feminism on the internet is evident in looking at any online political publication there isnt a single reputable liberal one that doesnt regularly feature feminist content and staff feministminded writers feminist blogs are some of the most highlytrafficked on the political internet but by doing so much work online are we missing out on something online work is important and effective and i dont plan on taking myself offline anytime soon but in chatting with the older folks on this cruise im realizing how much hardearned knowledge and experience we lose when we dont talk to each other polling shows that older people in the united states tend to be more conservative particularly on social issues regressive on gender equality against samesex marriage racially prejudiced they tend to vote republican and largely supported mitt romney in the last presidential election its easy for liberals to write them off as rightwing curmudgeons especially when our political interactions with older people too often amount to them wagging their fingers at us for not doing enough the stereotype of the romneyvoting racist grandpa is hardly reflective of reality it may not be the job of young people to reach out to older folks in order to prove our dedication to our causes but it wouldnt be a bad idea to make small inroads by showing up at events like town hall meetings or political readings it would be great if progressive tech groups could create more partnerships with organizations like the aarp so that retirees could learn not just how to get online to keep up with the grandkids but could see where progressive action is happening on the internet and participate more fully in todays lefty communities progressive movements tend to appeal more to the young since they challenge entrenched assumptions about gender race sexual orientation and social mores republicans have honed the strategy of appealing to a fear of change its easier to exploit that fear in people who have been around for a long time and understand the world according to longheld views it is of course a losing strategy the world does change and the people whose views are the most traditional die off absent totalitarian governments brutally enforcing traditionalism societies evolve and progress but old people arent immovable they arent all holding conservative beliefs either the women now in their s and s were the leaders on the secondwave feminist and civil rights movements when they were in their s and s some are certainly living in the past convinced that todays women dont care about feminism arent doing activism the right way or should sit back and learn before we speak but many others are thrilled to see their banner carried on and are supportive of the younger activists who are setting our own priorities and agendas and as the babyboomers age during a time where people are living longer than ever certain issues will undoubtedly come to the political forefront hopefully with more liberal results healthcare endoflife options including the right to die and medical marijuana access young people are politically active engaged and passionate about social justice i see that in my work every day and there are of course many older folks who are just as adept at online activism as people in their s but the political internet skews young and we arent connecting with our elders as well as we could in part thats out of frustration with the dismissiveness with which were often treated by older folks who believe only they have earned the right to be in charge but its also a reflection of the different spheres in which liberal activism is happening the older people ive met this week are health clinic volunteers feminist authors state legislators and other activists with a wealth of wisdom to share and little interest in condescending lectures theyre people who care enough about liberal causes to want to come on a weeklong cruise to support one of the countrys oldest liberal publications they want to be more active online to see what the kids are doing we should embrace that urge and work on translating digital activism for people whose long activist histories are offline it is progressives after all who are working to build a society that supports the ageing and online spaces offer incredible platforms for connection across previously insurmountable boundaries and the sharing of information across cultures locations and experiences a bit more of a connection across generation gaps would broaden that universe even further the outcome i suspect wouldnt be hoary outdated activism it would be a wiser and more holistic progressive political base,2013-10,week im cruise nation magazine guest feminist columnist

as hot new feminist crusades go this one is admittedly terribly unsexy its got nothing to do with twerking waxing slutwalking or anything else that requires furtive googling if youre over sadly it cannot even be explained with giant photographs of a halfnaked miley cyrus its less about what we should tell our daughters than what our elderly mothers tell us or would be telling us if they werent so anxious not to be a nuisance and if they werent really quite resigned now to the idea that as the yearold sally lubanov told radio s today programme earlier this week their care workers havent given them a bath in three years the looming risk to the autonomy that grown women cheerfully take for granted not to mention the coming threat to our freedom to work for as long as we want or need is arguably the shambles that now passes for care of the elderly frailty is a feminist issue or at least it damned well should be and its amazing that we are not much much angrier about it it may sound odd to talk about care in these terms when its less about sisters doing it for themselves than sisters having it done for them by a home help preferably one allowed more than a miserable minutes to get a human being fed dressed washed and engaged in enough conversation to break up the monotony of another long lonely day and of course sickness injury and sheer rotten luck do not discriminate between the sexes it would be ridiculous to make this solely a womens issue when millions of men also care and are cared for that said the sandwich generation of unpaid relatives currently plugging the holes in a threadbare state system is disproportionately female so many harried daughters and daughtersinlaw changing sheets and chasing prescriptions and reading with a mounting sense of dread about nursing home scandals all while trying to hold down a job and a family life of their own women make up about of carers according to the charity carers uk but typically start younger than men theyre more likely to step in and help ageing parents and inlaws often while still working themselves whereas men tend to care more later in life and for their spouses its impossible to understand too why care workers are so badly paid and were even in good times long before austerity forced local authorities to get more for less without noting that theyre overwhelmingly women and that femaledominated professions tend to attract crummy salaries and while the most obvious gender inequality in old age is that men die younger that still leaves an awful lot of widows nursing their husbands to the end only to find theres nobody left to do the same for them theyre so often the ones waiting all day for the overdue care workers key in the lock hoping some stranger will come and fetch them breakfast before it actually gets dark we have somehow managed to create a system that works for absolutely nobody one that leaves the elderly lonely and neglected their farflung children guilty and wretched their care workers exploited and political solutions conspicuous by their absence cheap childcare is all the rage at westminster but an ominous silence surrounds the future of longterm care the working assumption seems to be that families will just have to look after their own a bit more with the state offering the bare minimum it dares and tough luck presumably on anyone without a family so while young women are quite right to pick the fights that matter to them anyone who can remember the days when madonna seemed every bit as shocking as miley cyrus might consider moving on there arent a lot of heady braburning moments here but whats needed is a populist movement to raise middleaged consciousness about care what has so far kept the dam from breaking is that the generation now immersed in caring is one to which stoical selfsacrifice comes fairly naturally when jilly cooper admitted recently that shes still writing bonkbusters in her s mainly to fund her husbands nursing bills she said she couldnt complain because leos my husband and ive got to get on with it the generation coming up behind however may be a lot less noble about it not to mention more likely to have divorced and less likely to have big families who can share the burden or to live near their children nobody likes to think about what that implies we all prefer not to dwell on the prospect of getting old helpless humiliated by a body that is no longer under our control its easier to paddle in the shallows of what ageing means for women to rage against sacked newsreaders and botox and why dating over is so impossible than to think about having to choose between getting a drink and going to the loo because the care worker hasnt time to help you do both or to ask why so many women end up running round after their inlaws while their husbands sail on regardless why is it that young fathers are increasingly expected to do their bit but grown sons arent but these questions go to the heart of what independence means for women as we grow older to know you could stay comfortably in your own home for as long as possible might be almost as liberating for older women now as getting their names on the mortgage deeds was years ago to know you can go out and earn a living without worrying that your parents will starve if youre not there checking that a nurse helped them to eat would be emancipation of a very modern kind after a year in which politics has been dominated by the reactionary fears of angry old men its high time we heard from some angry older women this article was amended on october the earlier version made several references to carers including one to professional carers and another to substitute carers where care workers was meant as the guardian style guide says a carer is an unpaid family member partner or friend who helps a disabled or frail person with the activities of daily living not someone who works in a caring job or

its good to welcome a new feminist magazine to the world whatever its name and however it is delivered online offline or by carrier pigeon in the years that have elapsed since spare rib hit the newsstands the world has changed dramatically for women some of it good some not so but in recent years there has been a worrying complacency where there should still be anger and great concern it seems to me that all the big advances of feminism and remember i am setting this against the s rules which stated that women couldnt get a mortgage unless countersigned by a father or a husband couldnt even rent a tv or a car unless a man was involved have been for women at the top of society marching up through the professions gaining autonomy and independence emerging from the shadows of domesticity and taking their place in the cultural landscape of our country we are continually breaking yet more glass ceilings with the likes of clara furse in the london stock exchange and with apologies margaret thatcher in downing street but what have these gains done for poorer women not a lot almost two women a week are still murdered in incidents of domestic violence the same as in when erin pizzey founded the first womens refuge in chiswick there are still far too many women fleeing violent homes and far too few places for them to go women are still trapped in appalling cycles of poverty as they cannot afford childcare and jobs that allow flexi working are few and far between women still end up as part timers exploited by bosses and badly paid because juggling childcare and work when youre on the bread line is just as hard as it always was women are still societys carers undertaking the valuable work of caring for the elderly or the disabled in this they are still as exploited by society and the government as they were years ago yes there is better education yes there are some jobs and divorce is easier but look around you there are far too many single mums bringing up their kids and struggling with poverty and the men sad to say have scarpered at the other end of the social scale i wouldnt say all was wonderful either forty years ago on the first issue of spare rib we ran an advert for rimmel cosmetics because we needed the money i was convinced that such ads were a dying breed never again would women feel in thrall to looks and the myths and lies of the cosmetic giants how wrong could i be today women are slaves to beauty with young girls appearing to rate their looks as more important to them than their brains or personalities how on earth did this happen so there is much to do and not just here in the uk feminists such as eve ensler highlight the violence meted out to women in the congo half the sky the recent book looking at the state of women around the globe painted a dismal portrait of a world where women are increasingly trafficked and sold into slavery and this happens here too the feminist times looks good and im glad it has

nobody likes a feminist at least not according to researchers at the university of toronto following a study where it emerged that people still defer to stereotypes about typical feminist activists stereotypes including manhating and unhygienic these stereotypes are apparently seriously limiting the appeal of womens liberation as a lifestyle choice feminism is a mess and needs to sort itself out in order to be relevant to young women today it needs to shave its legs and get a haircut elle seems to think so too the fashion and beauty magazine not a historically notable manual for gender revolution has weighed in this month with a spread on rebranding feminism asking three advertising agencies to give gender politics a nip tuck and polish the result is flowcharts and a lot of hot pink equivocation that airbrushes out the ugly uncomfortable bits of womens liberation like the word feminism which some people seem to have a problem with theyd prefer us to consider mens feelings first when we speak about work pay and sexual violence to be less threatening to dress it up theyd prefer us to talk about equalism if we must speak at all those with a vested interest in the status quo would prefer young women to act more like theyre supposed to to make everything including our politics as pretty and pleasing as possible the rebranding of feminism as an aspirational lifestyle choice a desirable accessory as easy to adjust to as a detox diet and just as unthreatening is not a new idea nor is elle magazine even the first glossy to attempt the task in recent years but unfortunately theres only so much you can rebrand feminism without losing its essential energy which is difficult challenging and full of righteous anger you can smooth it out and sex it up but ultimately the reason many people find the word feminism frightening is that it is a fearful thing for anyone invested in male privilege feminism asks men to embrace a world where they do not get extra special treats merely because they were born male any number of jazzy fonts wont make that easy to swallow it is not young women today who need to be convinced that feminism remains necessary and relevant changing technology has shaken up a tsunami of activism around gender and politics from initiatives like the unslut project and everyday sexism to sea changes in culture like the backlash against sexual violence in india in all of these movements young women are leading the charge along with a few fighters from older generations who have not been worn down by decades of mockery and marginalisation while the fashion press and the beauty industry remain invested in the idea of young women as pliant affable and terminally anxious about getting boys to like them real women and girls are fighting back against a culture that persists in trying to present our desires and rebrand our politics as fluffy and marketable the stereotype of the ugly unfuckable feminist exists for a reason because its still the last best line of defence against any woman who is a little too loud a little too political just tell her that if she goes on as she is nobody will love her correct me if im wrong but ive always believed that part of the point of feminist politics part of the point of any sort of radical politics is that some principles are more important than being universally adored particularly by the sort of men who would prefer women to smile quietly and grow our hair out in the words of the early suffragist and civil rights campaigner susan b anthony cautious careful people always casting about to preserve their reputation or social standards never can bring about reform those who are really in earnest are willing to avow their sympathies with despised ideas and their advocates and bear the consequences i am not so very old but im old enough to have noticed that the times in my life when i was most admired by men the times when i was considered most likeable were also the times when i was most vulnerable most powerless and unsure of myself the times when ive been strongest and most daring the times when ive been proudest of my own achievements thats when ive

im going to tiptoe into the minefield of the misogynymisandry debate not because i have any wish to join it but because a recent example provoked some of the most vivid and aggressive comments to appear below the line on our website and also illustrated the dangers of relying on other newspapers reporting when trying to frame an argument a recent opinion piece headlined man hating women just arent up to the task attracted comments some displaying predictably boorish prejudice others complaining that the paper was trying to stir up a row to increase hits on the site more significant were those that claimed the author had seriously misinterpreted some new academic research to bolster her thesis barbara ellen had written how the term misandry hatred for contempt for or ingrained prejudice against men had become the riposte of choice to accusations of misogyny accusations of misandry were made she wrote whenever concerns were raised about domestic violence parliamentary representation or pay gaps however she believed that misandry would never reach the level of misogyny because it hasnt got the rage painting a picture we can all recognise she continued ive never known a woman to carry that chilling aura of compressed permarage against the opposite sex that hangs around certain men the relentlessly churning core of hostility condescension entitlement and resentment some of the commenters below the line would certainly belong in that contemptible category and can be ignored but others who challenged the central pillar ellen chose to support her argument are not so easily dismissed she claimed a recent study from the university of florida had said men are far more likely to secretly want their wives or girfriends to fail to be less successful than they are because it boosts their own sense of selfworth but the report doesnt say that one commenter pointed out that the research simply states that the men in the study suffered from low selfesteem when their partners succeeded it had nothing to say about men actively desiring their wives or girlfriends to fail ellen went on to describe the research as a study about male rage swirling around women everywhere even in their personal lives how else would you describe these men needing women to fail to make themselves feel better however the report doesnt mention anything about rage it examines how men feel about themselves and their relationship not the attitudes they have to their female partner directly so how then had these erroneous conclusions been reached ellen told me she had not seen the study but had instead relied on several press reports including a daily telegraph piece headlined men secretly want their wives to fail ultimately the study wasnt the main deal for me i wanted to widen it out to misandry and how it is so often overused to counter all sorts of issues around misogyny to the point where any debate gets automatically and rather tediously squashed i also wanted to write about male rage and how id personally never encountered an equivalent phenomenon in women this is why i led with these subjects and only later brought up the study really it could have been any study of its ilk certainly i didnt need it to suit my prejudices as some had claimed id have quite happily written the column without the study my main point being that misogyny is very deeply embedded in myriad ways and the current vogue for claiming misandry everywhere is mistaken to put it politely and stifles debate and i made it clear that i was talking about misogynists not all men i asked professor kate ratliff coauthor of the report if the telegraphs headline and the observer piece were a fair reflection of her study i would definitely say thats not a fair reflection she replied some of the headlines have been outrageous what we found is this men who think of a time that their romantic partner succeeded at something compared to thinking about a failure experience gutlevel subconscious negative feelings about themselves women do not show such a reduction in their implicit selfesteem this study provides no evidence whatsoever that men want their partners to fail it concerns what happens to mens feelings about themselves not about what happens to mens feelings about their partners readerobservercouk comments will be turned on later this morning,2013-10,im

hundreds of thousands of families losing child benefit payments this year need to get off their backsides and fill in extra forms to avoid being fined by the taxman the head of her majestys revenue and customs has said lin homer chief executive of hmrc said more than families still needed to register for the selfassessment tax forms as part of the governments plans to take away child benefit for higher earners under the proposals households in which one parent earns more than will lose some or all of their child benefit which is worth more than a year for a family with two children many have already opted not to receive the benefit but the rest will continue to receive child benefit payments and have some or all of it taken away through the tax system depending on how much they earn families must fill in forms about their income under the selfassessment process but hundreds of thousands have still not identified themselves to hmrc before the deadline of october critics have argued the system is too complicated and that many families are still not aware that they will be affected by the coalitions changes however homer told bbc radio five on friday that many families due to lose their benefit were simply being inactive we think there are still people who still need to get off their backsides she said if anyones in doubt about whether they are in this category if they go to our website theyll find a calculator they can put in details and it will give them a very clear indication of whether they are caught or not there are a number of things such as pension contributions that can be taken off so its a really good way to be absolutely sure if you have done what you should have and weve made a mistake we will sort that out for those people who havent taken action yet please register for selfassessment if it proves not to be necessary we can always take you out but what we dont want people to do is face penalties just for being inactive under the changes made to the child benefit system in january more than million families are losing some or all of the value of their benefit which is paid at a rate of a week for the first child and a week for each additional child households where one parent has an income of more than face losing all their child benefit while those with one parent earning between and are subject to a charge against the benefit

seven months after plans for a new spare rib were unveiled charlotte ravens online magazine finally launched today and is already causing controversy named feminist times after the original founders of spare rib essentially refused to collaborate on the project the magazine has already been forced to delete an anonymous article in praise of forced sterilisations after activists took to twitter to express their outrage online campaign group everyday victim blaming led the protest against the piece that was on the sites taboo corner todays issue actually contains an article so full of victim blaming and womanhating nonsense i am surprised the editorial team thought it acceptable to publish shortly after this piece appeared feministtimes tweeted following a meeting with our editor weve removed the taboo corner piece and published an apology in place of the offending article is a statement clarifying that the magazine does not condone forced sterilisation and explaining that the articles purpose was to highlight controversial but personal inner battles between deeply held feminist principles and reactive emotions in this instance we got it wrong and we want to apologise the editorial team of six appeared to struggle with the demands of the internet age and apologised for technical glitches at the start of the project as editor raven has said that she wants to create a feminist private eye a satirical magazine of the old school rather than something closer to the more recent online successes of sites such as jezebel or even vagenda a print magazine is planned for later this year and the sites design and some content does seem to hark to an earlier age of printonly certainties dating from the launch of the original spare rib this is not just because of the unashamedly ideological nature of some of the material but also because of a technical hitch that saw few comments being posted on the site hours after the launch the articles themselves include no links to other pieces which also feels a bit retro beyond the handful of incendiary articles which also include how to be a man by music critic garry mulholland on his love of porn there are pieces on burning your shapewear nina power on d feminism and a new kind of feminist agony aunt offering both personal and political advice for a breast cancer sufferer with bodyimage concerns which feel fresh and interesting another piece by raven talks about the dilemmas of working with a glossy magazine elle on debranding not rebranding feminism my time as muse for elle has taught me that womens magazines are structurally incapable of originality she explains the launch of the bushproject by ad agency mother another recent collaboration with the feminist times given the projects mixed reception to date perhaps its a good thing the project did not go with its original title proper cunts in her first editorial or feminist times manifesto raven describes her site as a place where people can detox from mainstream media culture and meet interesting like and unlike minds the piece opens where have all the interesting women gone is it capitalism that has turned us into onedimensional consumerist ciphers or have thatcher blair and womens magazines rendered us all too self absorbed to be interesting the launch note does not let the spat with founders of the original spare rib rosie boycott and marsha rowe go unremarked as raven writes the lengthy written exegesis that they offered as a rationale for refusing to let me use the name without a legal battle reminded me of my school reports deeply wounding but also missing the point there are some retro references such as the use of the word glendas for female journalists who have yet to follow dame ann leslie on what was still called fleet street during ravens teenage years but it ends with a heartfelt plea for unfashionable consciousnessraising and whats not to like about that despite the initial controversy there is much to applaud about the notforprofit publications aim to draw on the uks wealth of grassroots feminist activism to launch a website magazine and campaigning arm a new online magazine for feminists is exciting at a time when feminism itself is enjoying a renewed wave of interest with the success of everydaysexism and no more page among others about members donated each for a site that aims to offer an interesting magazine for interesting women some of these supporters plus invited members of the press will go to a restitution ball tonight that will include men dressed as penitents serving celebratory women rod liddle invited to take part has sadly not yet rsvpd i have broken my grazia and mail online habit and hope others will do the same writes raven unlike blairs big conversation our desire to plug into the collective female consciousness is ideological not simply pragmatic the satire is not quite there yet perhaps it was up to sunday times journalist camilla long on twitter to snitter at the memberled organisation but it is early days feminism is a broad church badly served by its current priests on glossy magazines if not online so another entrant is to be

started out with a lot of you go girl news the us elections sent a record number of women to congress including in the senate a whole fifth a harbinger of change not experienced since the s then sheryl sandbergs lean in was published and despite some controversy it brought modern womens lives to the forefront of the national and international discussion women were encouraged to openly discuss their goals and ambitions and network with each other to achieve them but for all the lean in rallies and glass ceilings women are breaking we cant seem to get away from antiquated notions of how women must first and foremost be perfect wives women might be told to lean in at work but the message is still too often get retro at home last week it was the nonsensical retread of stephanie smiths sandwiches blog chronicling her attempt to make her boyfriend sandwiches in order to prove herself marriage material once shed raised collective eyebrows she then insisted it was all tongueincheek that may be true it was possibly calculated to follow the julie powell route to a book and film deal but the fact remains that she used language reminiscent of a s advertisement to tell her story less discussed but more disturbing was the publication of real housewives of new jersey star melissa gorgas book of marital advice although she disavows the assertion the book reads like an advocacy of marital rape as she advises submitting to ones husband whenever he wants despite your mood both she and her husband proudly extol a life wherein he never changes a diaper and she makes sure shes always got her makeup on and dinner ready it should be a joke but a top publisher thought it deserved space on the bookshelves and was something other women might find of value stories implying or insisting feminism doesnt work are media catnip and women writers continue to be happy to feed that beast enjoying the accompanying adulation as if all that wasnt enough last week in a suretobediscussed ongoing custody battle in new york a female lawyer was granted permission from a female judge to question the mother about an abortion shed undergone and whether that might have caused her stress rather than her exhusband even if the woman is awarded custody the fact that an abortion is being allowed as potential evidence to deny her is a chilling precedent make no mistake it always does come back to the governance of womens bodies if on a personal level some women feel compelled to present themselves as traditional nurturers in order to secure and keep a relationship on a political level the republicans dont waver in their attempt to keep women confined the week of us political gridlock and nonsense was followed by a weekend of horror with the house republicans gearing up to shut the government down and trotting out the canards of abortion and contraception rights as part of their grand bargain its a predictable move for the republicans one theyve made so many times its really just a reflex and its easy to call it misogyny just as its easy to call women like gorga a throwback but it isnt hate or selfhatred that prompts these continual pushes against womens social equality its fear the last vestiges of the white male power structure still cherish the dream of social dominance and a society where women as well as the poor racial minorities and the lgbt community are fully empowered is one where white men fear theyll have to struggle to find space and a voice which may reflect a functional inability to view power as anything other than absolute rule as though the idea of discussion negotiation and compromise is as womanly as a miniskirt a woman unable to govern her body is ultimately far more anxious even than the one who accepts conditions for an engagement or upholds those conditions in marriage she might stay away from the boardroom and political office so as to focus on the tiny domain allotted her if shes poor she will be even quieter a woman struggling just to make sure there is a meal may not have time and energy left to advocate for anything further by surrounding us with straw men and puffery the patriarchy continues to thrive by hiding the mechanism of its power it perhaps shouldnt be surprising that in this year the th anniversary of the equal rights amendments introduction in congress were still waiting on passage men are still seeking to control women and some women are still accommodating them maintaining a status quo is easier than answering a call to arms so the government might be shut down and womens health will be one of the bargaining chips to start it up again but there will be an election next year and since they havent yet tried to revoke the th amendment granting women the right to vote this might be

at a time when the proportion of rape cases that police are looking to charge has slumped to a third its unfortunate that we have a prime minister who cant decide whether or not he is a feminist i do hope he makes up his mind soon as the figures have been getting worse under each year of his government in there were cases of rape reported to the police of these or were referred to the crown prosecution service where specially trained prosecutors would make a decision on whether to charge the suspect only the cps can make that decision if a rape case doesnt fall on a prosecutors desk it doesnt get charged in there were just referrals while the number of policerecorded rapes actually rose to this would indicate that the proportion of rape cases referred to prosecutors for charging has fallen to just one third this may account for why the numbers of prosecutions are declining at a time when the underlying crime rate for rape is actually going up while real progress has been made by the cps on conviction rates with so many cases being disposed of by the police too few victims are benefiting from the advances made by prosecutors rape charities i have spoken to have expressed deep concern about the numbers of cases in which the police are taking no further action they have also voiced consternation at the practice of cautions being issued for rape and other serious sexual assaults there were simple cautions issued for rape last year and for sexual assault on males and females according to figures from the ministry of justice the justice secretary chris grayling told the conservative party conference that he would yield to labours call to address this this has to be welcomed provided it is all that it is cracked up to be however we should remember that a simple caution is just one form of outofcourt disposal police powers to issue conditional cautions without making reference to the cps are being expanded how are we to make sure that the same problems that beset the use of simple cautions dont apply to these as well on paper there were actually quite stringent rules governing when it was acceptable to caution sexual offences and other serious violent crimes only a police officer of a certain rank could do it and they had to consult with the cps first to make sure that this was the right thing to do but there is scant evidence that this was actually happening i sent a freedom of information request to police forces asking in how many instances they could confirm cps approval had been sought for cautions issued for penetrative sexual assault on an adult female it emerged from the forces that responded that of cautions issued for this particular indictableonly offence for just three was there any mention of a referral to the cps my concern is that under the pressure of the cuts and reforms that are being inflicted on the criminal justice system the same corners are going to be cut whatever tory ministers say in their setpiece speeches this is why as the shadow home secretary yvette cooper announced at conference a labour government would appoint a domestic and sexual violence commissioner who would implement national standards for tackling rape and domestic violence to make sure that police and prosecutors worked together and implemented national standards we would also as outlined by the shadow justice secretary sadiq khan allow victims to track their case as it winds its way through the criminal justice system and legislate to strengthen victims rights the coalition government likes to talk tough on law and order but the gulf between rhetoric and reality keeps widening the fact that no minister appears even to have acknowledged the slump in rape case referrals also reveals the full extent to which this government has a blind spot when it comes to women as a result we are going backwards on the investigation and prosecution of serious violent and sexual crime we will continue going backwards for as long as we have a prime minister who regards feminism as a dirty word,2013-10,time proportion rape case police looking charge ha slumped third unfortunate prime minister cant decide whether feminist

as yet another female tory mp announces she is to stand down the soulsearching has begun about why women still find life in the commons so unbearable laura sandys says she is leaving politics because of family demands but the impression given is she is part of a growing exodus of recently elected women rising stars forced out tragically early by the macho posturing in parliament sarah wollaston conservative mp for totnes complained that some women hardly ever spoke in the chamber for fear of being ridiculed for their highpitched voices one of my colleagues was mocked because for some women your voice starts to rise in pitch she explained everyone was deriding her because her voice got higher and higher it was so unkind and its very offputting i do not doubt that we have all witnessed those bearpit moments at prime ministers questions calm down dear david cameron told angela eagle because she was shouting as loud as the men this sort of sexist intimidation is wrong of course but i would argue that rather than wait for the utopian day when men stop being misogynistic female mps should toughen up if women are not to be driven out of politics altogether the new generation of female mps needs to stand firm the problem is not that male politicians can be childish and offensive but that todays female politicians dont seem to know how to handle them among the intake now complaining of sexism none i can think of is worthy of that most auspicious term battleaxe battleaxes used to be a feature of parliament and they did a better job of holding their own than the current shrinking violets would ann widdecombe gwyneth dunwoody shirley williams barbara castle or indeed margaret thatcher have been silenced by taunts about their voices mo mowlam was lampooned for looking like a geordie trucker before she revealed that she had put on weight because of treatment for a brain tumour she died in instead of whingeing about the ridicule she endured the northern ireland secretary whipped off her wig during meetings with pofaced ulstermen to lighten the mood many other veteran female mps deserve mention margaret beckett and dawn primarolo never capsized under the weight of some pretty awful taunts harriet harman and tessa jowell always put a brave face on things despite constantly fighting men who sought to put women back in their box on the conservative side theresa may is consistently tough and uncomplaining in the face of personal abuse if you believe in public service you see you believe that any inconvenience you suffer as an individual is par for the course but this is a concept the new generation do not understand louise mensch gave the impression that the tragedy of her resignation was how politics had failed her not how she might have failed politics perhaps the selection procedures that gave us women who resigned after a few years have a lot to answer for i sometimes doubt whether gwyneth mo shirley and barbara would be given a seat now would camerons alist have singled out ann widdecombe im not convinced i have a horrible suspicion that someone at conservative hq would have decided the young margaret hilda didnt have the wow factor or the ability to reach out to the ethnic vote but when you select people for their ability to tick boxes they dont always have what it takes to survive ultimately politics requires women with hides like rhinos women who are sufficiently on fire with conviction to stand up and fight of the younger crowd there are fledgling possibilities charlotte leslie for the tories and gloria de piero and mary creagh for labour show promising signs of being as tough as old boots and i hope they will take that as a compliment we need more like them for if female mps turn around and retreat it delivers to

make it to the top margaret thatcher is an example that springs to mind it is a great pity that there hasnt been more focus on the eus mandatory gender quota itself the penalties include closing down the company if they have too many men or women dissolving the company would hardly benefit either gender employed there all would be unemployed his comments come just two months after bloom another

i am not even sure where to start to respond to michelle cottles recent politico article in which she calls first lady michelle obama a feminists nightmare cottle suggests that obama is underplaying her position of power and letting feminists down do i begin with the implicit narrow definition of feminism touted by the writer and those she quotes or do i begin with the equally simplistic understanding of activism and political action inherent in the criticisms what these so called feminists fail to see is that michelle obama is a social and political activist working passionately in arenas commonly ignored by white politicians and white feminists the needs of the children and youth raised in lowincome communities including equal access and availability to health and nutritional education focusing on obesity and exercise for young people is not only a needed form of social activism to help predominately minority youth break cyclic issues of health education and low selfesteem but it also shows foresight and wisdom towards creating and sustaining healthier communities overall these same young people who feminists criticize the first lady for spending so much time and energy on will grow up to be the next generation of adults making an impact in the ongoing development of this country michelle obama is using her role as a woman of power in the highest office in the country to educate inform raise and expand the imagination of children and youth how is that not social activism and political strategy of the most essential order beyond disagreeing with cottle about the significance of the first ladys work i also do not adhere to linda hirshmans and the articles other quoted feminists needlepoint perspectives of what feminism is or what feminists can or cannot do why does michelle obamas choosing especially as an african american woman to invest in the future of children hers and others have to equate to a blow to feminist projects it is both shameful and contradictory to the very nature of feminism itself that cottles article reads like the scene from a schoolyard bullying attempt trying to get the alarmingly confident and focused new kid to conform to the arbitrary rules that determine who is in and who is out a true feminist like any individual who asserts justice and equality for all without discrimination not only recognizes her innate rights to equal access and treatment but also seeks to use those rights to ensure a more just future for all who are marginalized michelle obama is using her power and place to reach some of the nations most vulnerable in her democratic national convention speech to which cottle refers negatively michelle obama says of her husband and he reminds me that we are playing a long game here and that change is hard and change is slow and it never happens all at once the first ladys passion for childhood and youth health and education seems to be representative of that wise counsel do these feminist critics have any idea how important the first ladys work is for underprivileged communities most of whom are african american since becoming first lady michelle obama has pursued a diverse range of activities and initiatives to bring about the vital work of getting children and youth to believe in and work towards a better future for themselves and effectively for their communities everything from her antichildhood obesity initiative to her recent focus on ensuring more low income youth go to college is proof that michelle obama is leaning in and leveraging her power but apparently the first ladys just not leaning enough towards the agenda of upper middle class predominately white socalled feminists despite being a strong independent accomplished and ambitious woman in power michelle obama is leaning in for the benefit of those who her critics would likely just ignore,2013-11,even sure start respond michelle cottles recent politico article call first lady michelle obama feminist nightmare

we have known for some time that the number of convictions for rape and sexual assault are only the tip of the iceberg now thanks to a survey of more than women and men across britain we have a clearer idea of the true scale of the problem in britain one woman in and one man in have experienced sex against their will since they turned more than half of them have never told a soul for those who support victims of sexual violence these findings from the third national survey of sexual attitudes and lifestyles published on tuesday will be a bleak confirmation of what they already suspected for the rest of us they are sobering statistics that indicate for the first time just how prevalent sexual coercion is among ordinary people living ordinary lives the public debate about sexual violence invariably alights on police handling of cases and on prosecution and conviction rates much progress has been made in recent times although baroness sterns independent review of rape and the justice system concluded that implementation of best practice was patchy but tackling nonconsensual sex through the police and courts alone can never be enough we must think of sexual coercion as a public health issue too as something not only to be prosecuted but also to be prevented to do that we must first reach a shared interpretation of the meaning of sexual coercion so that victims can properly understand what has happened to them and we can all work harder to stop it from happening to others one of the most disquieting aspects of our research is that prevalence estimates for sexual coercion are markedly higher than those for rape in the crime survey for england and wales one reason could be that some dont think of themselves as victims of crime this chimes with us research which suggests that even when a sexual assault meets the legal definition of rape nearly twothirds of victims dont label it as such i worry that victims are explaining coercion away as misunderstanding or are blindly following a powerful sexual script of male initiative and female passivity which fails to identify when a line is crossed the underlying reasons for a culture normalising coercion to the extent that its victims sometimes fail to see it are multiple and complex they are rooted in unequal gender norms and power dynamics changing these will mean changing the way our society thinks about and portrays sexual interaction whether in popular culture or our own relationships the challenge is immense but we know where to start we have to start intervening at an early age while attitudes to gender and sex are developing among girls and boys school sex education mostly does a good job of teaching the biology of sex and reproduction but education about relationships is not always available this has to be provided to all children in every type of school to empower young people and to help them to develop healthy relationships free from coercion as the mother of two girls i want my daughters to understand consent and the importance of respect in relationships i want them to be able to recognise potentially dangerous or coercive situations and develop skills for handling them these things can be taught integrating them into sex education wouldnt by itself remove the coercive edge from our culture but it would equip young people to withstand it what makes me hopeful is that we know that social norms can change when the national survey began two decades ago fewer than one in four men thought that samesex partnerships were not wrong at all that proportion has now doubled if attitudes that were once thought to be as deeply ingrained as this can change and change so fast attitudes to consent and coercion can too,2013-11,known time number conviction rape sexual assault

with her violent exboyfriend knocking down the front door and threatening to kill her clare wood made a desperate call to the police she had previously accused george appleton of harassment sexual assault and criminal damage yet it took greater manchester police hours to respond to her emergency call this delay due to the lack of police patrols was one of many individual and systemic failures found by the independent inquiry once wood had been strangled and set on fire by her former partner in appleton had a history of violence against women including time in prison a fact that led woods family to campaign for the right for those worried about a partners abusive behaviour to be told about their criminal record the announcement on monday that clares law as the subsequent right to know has been called is to be rolled out nationally came on a day officially designated as international day for the elimination of violence against women however without a better response from police nationally to allegations of domestic violence clares law is unlikely to eliminate anything if a woman is worried enough to go to the police and ask whether their partner has a previous record odds are that she already has serious doubts about him wood certainly did according to the crime survey for england and wales million women and men reported being victims of domestic abuse last year up in the past three years conviction rates are at their highest recorded levels yet incredibly the number of cases the police refer for prosecution has fallen by there are huge discrepancies across the country with some police authorities acting early enough to gather vital evidence while others do notthe labour party believes a fall in police budgets since could be to blame shadow attorney general emily thornberry says its much easier to prosecute a shoplifter perhaps more worryingly funding for womens services running refuges and domestic violence support centres has been cut by in the past two years so what good will clares law actually do once they find out their partners violent history what help does the law give women if refuges are closing in woods case even a panic alarm at home failed to help the independent police complaints commission report into the handling of woods case stated women suffering domestic violence should not feel scared to approach the force for help which seems to be a starter for once they go to the police women should also be confident that the police will do all they can to help and there are already laws for that,2013-11,violent exboyfriend

i am a halfarsed accidental feminist i said it its a relief to get it off my chest by halfarsed i dont mean that i dont care deeply about the feminist cause i do i just only engage with it about half the time the rest of the time im doing other stuff problematic stuff stuff that might not even be that feminist reading mail online doing drunken twerking in the kitchen having friends oh and the diet ive been on a diet for the last year which you might say considering how vocal ive been about faddy regimes is the height of hypocrisy or you might find it rather sad that someone who spends a lot of their time lamenting how societys unrealistic beauty standards are used to control and oppress women is a victim of those same standards either way ive lost two stone and my clothes fit me again its difficult being a halfarsed feminist in a movement that seems to demand both your innards and your soul but i think ive been pulling it off with panache i always maintained that i would never write one of those inwardlooking columns that aims to unpick the intricacies of the feminist movement mainly because they bore the tits off me but then it struck me that some of the barriers facing young women in terms of engaging with gender equality are so great that this needs to be discussed if youre anything like me prepare to be bored by this i apologise in advance when my friend holly baxter and i set up a satirical blog called the vagenda two years ago along with a group of our university friends we never saw ourselves as part of the feminist movement the blog took a tongueincheek look at womens magazines was written in a slangy easily comprehensible style and didnt take itself all that seriously in ridiculing the way women were portrayed in the media the entire ethos of the blog could be said to be feminist but i didnt really know anything about the modern feminist movement what it entailed and where my place in it might be we just got on with it indeed one of the great things about this new wave of female activism is that young women no longer feel they have to subscribe to a whole checklist of rigid ideas before becoming involved they focus on whats closest to their hearts whether thats page or everyday sexism or violence against women and try and do the best they can just as many women out there in their communities have been doing for generations some without ever feeling a need to use the term feminist part of our work with the vagenda has involved visiting schools and universities to chat to young women about just what it is about feminism they find so distasteful they told us that they think feminism is angry and scary and difficult and not for them and that feminists arent feminine or sexy and that they hate men frankly anyone who doesnt think feminism has an image problem or doesnt need rebranding a horrible term yes but one which essentially means communicating the same idea the equality of men and women differently for a new audience cant see the nose in front of their face the image these girls have of feminism comes partly from negative coverage in the media but i also get the sense that some of the more radical elements of the movement from the s and s lesbian separatism for instance alienated many women and made them nervous now their daughters are too after talking to these young women we wrote a column criticising academic feminists use of alienating terms such as intersectionality on the basis that most people dont understand them intersectionality basically means taking into account the way different systems of oppression race class disability sexual orientation relate to one another the article raised issue with the language not the concept but because we deigned to criticise the method of communication we were deemed racist it was very difficult because i fundamentally believe that we have a problem with representation that needs to be tackled and feminism needs to be for everyone but having a platform means that people without one direct their anger at you at your face and at your writing and as a halfarsed feminist im still learning how to cope with the pressure to represent everyone all the time some months later we were speaking at a debate about the most important issues facing british feminism today and the topic came up again one of the panellists said if you dont understand what intersectionality means then you can just google it i thought about the estate my dad lived on at the time working in it helping people learn to use computers luxuries many of the residents didnt have how the hell would they just google it for someone who wanted feminism to transcend class and racial barriers it seemed like the least intersectional thing you could ever say much like all those columns saying feminism is simple people just need to educate themselves the reaction to our getting involved with elles rebranding feminism campaign was in this vein just what it is that could be done to motivate people to want to find out more about feminism got lost in the criticism i just thought were doing our own thing why cant you do yours the constant litany of youre doing it wrong is dispiriting its been a huge struggle coming into this movement as a young woman all the ideological quibbling at that debate for example meant that such topics as sexual and domestic violence and the pay gap went undiscussed as they are going undiscussed here now again i fear sometimes that feminism will never have any mass appeal there are some people who i truly believe dont want to share it because it is a movement centred around oppression there are a lot of angry people involved in it i am not saying that that anger is not righteous i became more interested in feminism myself after i was attacked by a man but such anger can be alienating the infighting and the vitriol are turnoffs to a new generation a friend of mine who has been researching cannabis farming says that the legalise pot movement is the same factions all warring but at least they get to be stoned while doing it activist burnout is a wellknown condition a barnard university report warned that the dropout rate among feminist bloggers is incredibly high camilla long once wrote that feminism was almost like an emotion i agree and its draining eventually feeling this way all the time might mean you end up being that angry keyboard warrior or a lump of flubber on the floor and most women cant afford to do that because more than half the time theyre doing something else and often that something else involves looking after vulnerable people so being expected to look after their entire gender as well is a bit of a big ask the feminist movement needs these women and its losing them as the hilarious blog is this feminist points out being a marginally accepted feminist is a fulltime job and who on this earth has the time for that,2013-11,halfarsed accidental feminist said relief get

this week a twitter account called talksportdrive not to be confused with the account of the popular radio show talksportdrive tweeted the following charming request its titsouttuesday girls give me some entertainment before the game starts almost immediately two obliging women responded the first wrote heres a lovely pair but the picture attached might not have been exactly what the folk behind the request had in mind the second was equally forthcoming offering up a nice pair of jugs after i retweeted the request to the everyday sexism projects twitter followers more responses flooded in thick and fast over the course of the next minutes those lucky chaps at the talksportdrive twitter account received a veritable visual feast of all things titrelated they saw some lovely baps a pair of boobies a massive rack a couple of shapely pairs of legs a lovely muff some big bazookas a couple of huge hooters and even a cute little ass i could go on but you get the picture and would you believe it within the hour the account that had issued the original request was mysteriously closed down it was almost as if they didnt want to see any tits or boobies or knockers or bazookas after all no of course it wasnt the most important feminist victory of all time but it left me smiling quickly however i started receiving messages from people mainly men suggesting that to use humour as a means of communicating feminist ideas was to belittle the severity and importance of the cause the tone of my response it seemed was not angry or serious enough for them and this is a common charge levelled at feminists that they are being too fun and should put on a frown and get on with the proper business of being the shrieking harpies theyve so often been painted as there are two problems with this the first is that it plays into the tired stereotypical notion that to be a feminist is to be angry when in fact being a feminist just means believing that men and women should be treated equally realising just how unequal they are however is enough to piss anyone off but the fact that some feminists do sometimes get angry doesnt set them apart from anyone else in the general population statistically speaking and given the level of abuse they face theyve probably got more reason for it than most the second point is perhaps even more important every feminist should have the right to convey their message through whatever medium they choose whether it be academic articles performance art short films or gutwrenchingly funny jokes ive never understood the stern dworkin quote that has been adopted in so many social media bios feminist not the fun kind emphasis mine surely each method from feminist literature to feminist standup is likely to resonate with and engage a different audience with some overlap of course and dont we need all the support we can get the strongest argument in favour of feminist humour though is the enormous effect to which it can be used laughing at a problem doesnt just mean avoiding or belittling it it can be one of the most powerful and effective ways to expose and tackle it since i started the everyday sexism project ive seen hundreds of women and men perfectly demonstrate humours ability to debunk sexism here are a few of my favourites once had a guy ask would you mind telling me your brasize i replied no but tell me first how big your cock is amazingly he was shocked and found my comment highly inappropriate apparently the answer to are you a legs or tits man is not sorry im not a sexist i was walking to college when a group of thirtysomething men approached me one of them asked me is it true you can get an orgasm from riding a bike i wasnt even riding one i replied im more likely to get an orgasm from a bike than you his friends all laughed at him as i walked away guy at work used to think it was ok to only ever address me as big boobs morning big boobs etc i started addressing him as small penis he soon realised that maybe saying morning kate would be a better way to address me tired of cold callers asking to speak to the man of the house i now i put them on to my sixyear old son he sings them sexy and i know it guy on bus do you know where the playboy club is me sure its the next stop that minute walkll learn him haha dear guy i caught jacking off in your car while staring at me on the sidewalk

australian men are under attack according to the modern aussie man white paper launched on tuesday written by advertising agency mampc saatchi the white paper aspires to free men from the feminist minefield and reveal what every man is thinking based on interviews with men the report found that nagging feminists and humourless women have caused men to develop gender issue laryngitis with all the insight of a facebook what mcdonalds hamburger are you quiz the white paper groups all australian men into seven categories ranging from sensitive cockatoo to action man the report extols aussie men to just be you which according to one of their interviewees means to swear fart and tell her how i feel thats where you learn will learning through farting be the education breakthrough that closes the school achievement gap between boys and girls only time will tell the report quickly degenerates into a discussion of men as undiscovered consumers before inviting readers to book a presentation by an mampc saatchi representative who can show your company how to reach the elusive male consumer just in time for christmas while little more than a marketing gimmick for mampc saatchis advertising services the report was the centrepiece of the men and fathers strategic roundtable organised by warwick marsh at parliament house marsh is the founder of the mens rights group known as the fatherhood foundation since the fatherhood foundation was formed in marshs rhetoric about the social importance of masculinity and fatherhood has garnered him political support from both parties the fatherhood foundation is just one of a number of mens rights groups in australia whose vocal concern about male wellbeing is used as a cover for their campaigns against feminism and gay rights the various challenges facing men and masculinity such as mental and physical illness suicide violence and relationship breakdown are blamed on overempowered women and minority groups who are seen to have undermined real masculinity for these groups verballing feminism and gay rights as emasculating and trying to place men back atop the natural order is the solution to all male problems and anxieties after lobbying from mens rights groups the former liberal government under john howard instituted changes to australian family law intended to ensure that men were more likely to be given contact or shared custody of children during custody disputes these changes meant that courts favoured shared parenting even in cases of physical and sexual violence against the mother marshs political fortunes changed under the labor government family law reform has since placed greater emphasis on protecting women and children from violence and abuse marsh was dumped as a mens health ambassador in after writing a document that described homosexuality as a gender disorientation pathology caused by abuse neglect and mental illness he has since gone on to shed tears for the child of senator penny wong and her lesbian partner describing such children as future criminals substance abusers and suicide risks there are real problems facing men and masculinity globalisation and changes to the workforce have led to a longterm decline in the proportion of fulltime and bluecollar jobs transitions from childhood to adulthood and from school to work are less clear these changes have been difficult for both men and women boys and men struggling with these transitions can find their understandings of masculinity at risk and some turn to alternative methods to prove themselves including risktaking alcohol and violence these are leading causes of injury and death for males as well as females blaming feminism and sexual minorities will not solve these problems to the contrary the mens rights movement makes these issues worse by lobbying for policies and legislative changes that complicate the lives of men and women however their simplistic logic appeals to politicians whose neoliberal policies are responsible for many of the issues that the mens rights groups movement blames on women and gay poeple the socalled white paper might be a tonedeaf and opportunistic attention grab by a marketing agency but for warwick marsh it is as a positive celebration of true masculinity marsh now plans to use the mampc saatchi report to relaunch his lobbying efforts about mens wellbeing which he links to traditional christian family values the report might read like a bad joke but what happened the last time marsh had the ear of the federal government wasnt funny an earlier

police are failing to investigate some of the most serious crimes including rapes and sexual abuse of children in an attempt to massage official statistics a parliamentary committee was told mps on the commons public administration committee heard evidence from past and present officers who claimed the fiddling of crime figures was done to boost apparent performance former west midlands chief inspector dr rodger patrick said the failure to investigate serious allegations properly had catastrophic consequences i highlighted this issue in relation to incidents involving domestic violence and child protection child abuse but the incidents werent recorded and investigated and subsequently this led to homicide that is the extreme end of the risk that people are taking it isnt just about fudging the figures to keep everybody happy there are really serious consequences of this behaviour peter barron a former detective chief superintendent in the metropolitan police told mps that some crime victims are harassed by police into dropping allegations many people are persuaded that their pocket hasnt been picked is it possible that youve lost it they have been rung back on so many occasions to try and persuade them that in fact they were mistaken and no violence was used it merely just slipped from their bag the former officer said that those who try to blow the whistle on the fiddling of crime figures are victimised by and large they are marginalised if they apply for promotion they are not selected they are judged to be not a team player the committee also heard from a serving met constable who alleged parliament had been spoonfed misleading crime figures for over a decade pc james patrick said figures from his own force on rape were being kept artificially down patrick told mps that his research showed of rape allegations that were classed as not meriting investigation were wrongly dismissed he said he had spoken to his forces crime management unit which ran statistical and recording policies patrick told the committee a preference had developed to try to justify no crime on the basis of mental health or similar issues of vulnerability or by saying that the victim has refused to disclose to them committee chair bernard jenkin asked this would finish up with trying to persuade a victim that they werent raped for example patrick responded effectively yes pc patrick had been placed on restricted duties by the metropolitan police and ordered not to have contact with the public external agencies or stakeholders after an internal investigation was launched after he used twitter to claim government reforms and cuts to the police service could jeopardise public safety police massaging of figures on rape involved a practice whereby officers classed allegations as crimerelated incidents rather than crimes meaning the cases were not investigated properly in the guardian revealed up to six boroughs in the met had used the technique in breach of the forces policy that all rape complaints should be treated as crimes and investigated unless evidence emerged to the contrary rape crisis england amp wales said it was very concerned by the allegations such practices were continuing a spokesperson said we have made it clear that levels of no criming recording that no crime has been committed following a report to police urgently needed to be addressed and are extremely disappointed if little or no improvement has been made we are aware how incredibly difficult it can be to make a report to the police and how disheartening it can be if those reports are met with disbelief or discouragement the spokesperson added that only of the women who are raped and over who are sexually assaulted in england and wales every year currently even report to the police in a statement the met said it was committed to ensuring crimes are accurately recorded and has put in place robust processes to ensure crimes are neither over nor underrecorded the force added that it had appointed a force crime registrar to act as the final arbiter regarding crime recording joanne mccartney a member of the london assembley and labours group spokesperson on crime and policing said it is essential that boris johnson investigates these allegations urgently and i have written to him asking to do so if crime statistics are being falsified in any way this practise must end immediately,2013-11,police failing investigate serious crime including rape sexual abuse child attempt massage official statistic parliamentary committee wa told mp

solve childcare and you win the election this is the calculation politicians make whether they set about it like nick clegg rolling out childcare for the poorest undertwos or like ed miliband promising am to pm care for schoolkids or you take david camerons rather perverse course of making childcare slightly cheaper for rich people nobody can afford to walk away from the territory there are votes in them there kindergartens a practical family mind planning what to do with its young rather than how to cast its vote might ask some questions that arent about the bottom line would you necessarily want to leave your twoyearold in the care of a state whose department of education undersecretary liz truss famously worries about them running around with no sense of purpose how does one measure purpose exactly is it with a test do you want your toddler tested or even your fouryearold and thats a pretty long day that milibands offering isnt it am to pm its longer than my day and ive had all social anxiety bleached out of me by the slightlytoohot wash of life sorry of course this is all off topic this discussion is about childcare those questions were about education and by the terms of todays politics those are two totally different things albeit performed by the same people upon the same people in the same place more to the point i was being offmessage youre not allowed to ask whether a solution for the mother also works for the child since thats de facto unfeminist women by modern logic win by having economic agency and lose by being economically excluded children having no productive contribution to make are either a neutral value in the equation an appendage of the mother or a negative value a drain on the mother what if the mother wants to hang out with the child not because she has been subjugated by the patriarchy but because she thinks the child is awesome what if the father does too well that point of view makes no financial sense so unfortunately cannot be included in our discussion all we hear is a series of conversations about the economic case for childcare its often billed as the softer yet stronger economic policy just as women are egregiously in my view presented as the softer yet stronger sex the shadow minister for children lucy powell contrasted on comment is free business case after business case for boys toys like planes and trains against the case for childcare as a key economic driver to get women and it is still mainly women back into work leaving aside the wisdom of trying to turn rail infrastructure into a gendered issue in this day and age this remark distils the approach of the mainstream which holds economic productivity as the highest goal of the human being yet if you raise those stayathomes the vexatious mothers who are in no rush to get back to work who want to savour what is set against or in the future more like years of a career the unbearably short and precious timespan of a childhood well then you have allied yourself to a different sort of tory the breadwinner tory the marriage taxbreak tory the tory for whom getting women back into the kitchen is the first stage of getting the world back to rights this entire conversation is caught between the ukip frying pan and the treasury fire redomestication on one side a monetising pricetagoneverything agenda on the other received wisdom has moved so far from lived experience that its almost comical nobody apart from godfrey bloom still thinks women should be fulltime mothers as a function of their sex nobody apart from the career bitch of the daily mails imagination wants fulltime free nurseries running from birth straight into wraparound free schooling its not like parking a car wherever you leave your children and thats great if its convenient and free youre still left with the problem of not being around them what almost everybody wants is this the option of working fulltime if they want or need to without spending every penny they make on childcare but the ability to work parttime if theyd rather divide their lives more equitably between home and work an abundance of interesting and flexible jobs so they can get away from their children for the sake of their sanity but not so much work that they cease to be the main influence in their childrens lives people want the freedom to react to things an illness an irrational hatred of nursery without that signifying a lack of professional commitment never mind women this is what all parents want some recognition from the workplace and beyond that there is more to life than making money and yet that making money is a blessed diversion from fulltime making a mess these are very simple ideas but to execute or even show oneself able to understand them would take a significant shift in political stance not only would politicians need to stop talking about workforce participation as the only meaningful yardstick of successful social policy theyd also have to stop talking about employers as these godlike creators of wealth and talk of them instead as people with as much responsibility to act like human beings as the rest of us we will all have periods in our lives when we are producing sod all that anybody could buy when we are economically stagnant some of those will be our happiest moments we cant allow this debate to reduce us all to a

sometimes seeing the whole picture is difficult when the detail is dripfed but after a year of detailed announcements and changes the education secretary michael goves agenda to privatise child protection is becoming visible here are the governments six steps to child protection privatisation rubbish social workers by requiring that a serious case review into a childs death is published in full and then describe it as risible if it does not deliver on a plate the heads of social workers as happened last week when childrens minister edward timpson criticised the scr into the death of hamzah khan pictured ensure there is plenty of critical comment to feed the press and if there is any local reluctance to publish in full a review to protect the identities and welfare of remaining children have a national panel with no sharpend experience in child protection to bully the local safeguarding children board into publication take care that attention is not on the role and involvement of the police doctors health workers or schools give the blame culture credibility by making sweeping statements about politically correct and naive social workers who are concerned about the increasing deprivation created by welfare cuts for a growing number of children and families they meet every day introduce fasttrack training for a small number of bright graduates they will form the future cadre of leaders with no strong roots in social work but who will be the ambitious future managers in privatised child protection discredit existing social work education create a child protection system nationally that is at the point of breakdown then fragment organisations such as schools and health services that need to work together locally to protect children and set them up instead in competition ensure assistance through childrens centres and sure start is reduced for struggling families dramatically cut council funding so that as more work piles in councils cannot increase their capacity to deal with it social workers then have to cut corners and when something terrible happens to a child are targeted for blame and abuse use other organisations to fuel the privatisation agenda ofsted as the national hitandrun inspectorate makes its standards harder to achieve at the same time as councils child protection teams struggle to cope with increasing workloads each separate ofsted report focuses on the failings of individual councils with no comment on the national context in addition ask people with no expertise in child protection to prepare public reports that will undermine social work practice so the way has been paved for serco gs and venture capitalists to make money from child protection it will not only lead to increasing costs but will undermine one of the safest and strongest child protection systems in the world its frightening that goves government dogma is likely to lead to so much damage and disintegration leaving children less

do men face discrimination i dont mean gay men or black men or poor uneducated men or even short men or come to think of it the many judged typical boys every day but just men all men in a world where the male sex makes up just under half of the global population but of all those in power i would say probably not indeed in a world where not all countries guarantee womens equal property rights and of the population living in absolute poverty are female id go so far as to say the suggestion that men face discrimination as a sex is a bit ludicrous which should mean that todays international mens day partly designed to end discrimination is a bit of a joke a campaign from people whose response to any statistic about women being physically abused or dominated or belitted is to say but what about the menz yet im all for international mens day as a supporter of the idea that men and women should be treated equally why shouldnt men have their own day to match the one set aside to promote women and their causes in march and there are really important issues when it comes to mens rights id just like to know what causes this day is actually for there doesnt seem to be much of a global consensus in australia they give red roses because they are symbol of strength of character and courage elsewhere they focus on battlefield prowess or mens health although in china apparently they add fashion to the mix international womens day took off in the early part of the last century as women in europe and the us campaigned for the right to vote according to wikipedia it seems that imd was inaugurated in in trinidad and tobago by a dr jerome teelucksingh from the families in action headquarters who chose november mainly because it was his fathers birthday saying some have said that there is fathers day but what about young boys teenagers and men who are not fathers the day is now celebrated in countries the idea for a day to celebrate mens achievement first emerged in the late s when the socalled second wave of feminists dared to ask for more than the right to vote and a group that became the mens rights movement was telling them theyd never had it so good it is perhaps unsurprising that a renewed interest in a day of action for men comes as feminism itself enjoys a resurgence in the past year a website has been set up explaining what an international mens day should do in the uk the campaigns objectives include promoting male role models celebrating the contribution that men make highlighting discrimination against men and the inequalities that men and boys face and thus improving gender relations and gender equality when these objectives are set against political power they make no sense men at the top of politics business and the media are male role models whatever you think of them individually so the argument must be when it comes to the sphere typically known as domestic and indeed organisations that fight for mens rights as fathers are among the sites supporters the last of this years five challenges to keep men and boys safe is to promote fathers and male role models there is inequality when it comes to parenting in the uk and much of the developed world reams of research suggest that women still do the lions share of household duties even as more and more of them carry out paid work so entrenched is the idea that women look after children that only recently has shared parental leave become law in the uk women still take the vast majority of this leave as maternity leave this dominance can mean a belittling of men at home and an uneasiness often unverbalised about their presence in the playground for example this same attitude starts with boys who quickly learn that its never ok to cry and nurturing is a bit girly im all for changing attitudes like this but theres already a movement that supports dads in the playground and in the kitchen that movement is called feminism over the past few years ive been asked why do we need an international womens day so many times that i fear my answer has become a bit pat because its mens day every other day of the year is my standard reply yet renewed interest in international mens day has made me think of the many things that could change to make men and women more equal in all spheres of our daily lives this doesnt belittle the deep injustice many women suffer around the world or the casual everyday sexism that defeats them at every hurdle if anything pointing out the discrimination against men simply underlines how much worse it is for women happy international mens day,2013-11,men face discrimination dont mean gay men black men poor uneducated men even short men come think many judged typical boy every day men men world male sex make half global population power

being a mother is not the most important job in the world there i said it nor is it the toughest job despite what the of people polled in parents magazine reckon for any woman who uses that line consider this if this is meant to exalt motherhood then why is the line always used to sell toilet cleaner and if being a mother is that important why arent all the highly paid men with stellar careers not devoting their lives to raising children after all i never hear being a father is the most important job in the world the deification of mothers not only delegitimises the relationship fathers neighbours friends grandparents teachers and carers have with children it also diminishes the immense worth and value of these relationships how do gay dads feel about this line i wonder or the single dads stepdads or granddads no matter how devoted and hard working you are fellas youll always be second best im also confused as to what makes you a mother is it the actual birth or is a mother simply a term to describe an expectation to care for children without payment is this empty slogan used to compensate women for gouging holes from potential careers by spending years out of the workplace without recognition enabling this dogma devalues the unpaid labor of rearing children as much as it strategically devalues womens worth at work if being a mother were a job thered be a selection process pay holidays a superior to report to performance assessments friday drinks and you could resign from your job and get another one because you didnt like the people you were working with its not a vocation either being a mother is a relationship even if it were a job there is no way being a professional mother could be the hardest when compared to working hours a day in a clothing factory in bangladesh making bricks in an indian kiln or being a chinese miner nor could it ever be considered the most important job in comparison with a surgeon who saves lives anyone running a nation or a judge deciding on peoples destiny there is also a curious sliding scale to the argument working career mums are at the lower end of the spectrum and stay at home mothers are at the highest echelons with ascending increments for each child you have the more hours of drudgery you endure the more of a mother you are and therefore the more important your job is the more you outsource domestic labour and childcare to participate in the workforce the less of a mother you are it really is time to drop the slogan it only encourages mothers to stay socially and financially hobbled it alienates fathers discourages other significant relationships between children and adults and allows men to continue to enjoy the privileges associated with heteronormative roles in nuclear families despite men sucked into this having their choices limited as well its fine to use motherhood as a credential if youre talking about something related to actual motherhood like vaginal tearing during birth or breastfeeding despite not all mothers experiencing either but if youre using motherhood to assert that you care more about humanity than the next person if youre using it as a shorthand to imply that you are a more compassionate and hardworking person than the women and men standing around you then feel free to get over yourself,2013-11,mother important job world said

two women killed a week one in five calls families driven from their homes lives destroyed by fear if there was this much violence at football matches there would be government taskforces new laws

has been cut and the clock is being turned back the impact of domestic abuse is immense ive talked to a woman who was so afraid of her husband that she locked herself in her childrens bedroom each night for months before she found the strength to leave prosecutions and convictions have fallen heavily since the last general election in more domestic abuse is being reported to the police but fewer cases are being sent for prosecution with a big drop in convictions as a result bluntly that means fewer criminals stopped and more potential victims at risk legalaid changes have made it harder for victims to take out injunctions against abusers and there has been no leadership from the home secretary theresa may isnt demanding the action we need we dont have to accept this cycle of violence and abuse we need strong leadership and new national standards practice by police and councils varies too much we need a new commissioner modelled on the childrens commissioner covering violence against women and domestic violence with the power to ensure standards are raised its not only about criminal justice vera baird northumbrias police and crime commissioner is doing great work in the northeast to get employers to sign up to training and awareness but why isnt the government promoting this nationally too and why is the government still refusing to do more to prevent abuse among teenagers its time we had updated compulsory sex and relationship education in schools to teach zerotolerance of violence to boys and girls yet michael gove the education secretary opposed labours amendments to the children and families bill proposing that reform violence within the home has been ignored for too long hardwon progress has been too quickly discarded there should be a national

more than people have signed a petition calling on the government to sever its contract with bounty amid claims the controversial parenting club is exploiting new mothers and fathers bounty sales reps distribute child benefit claim forms to new parents on hospital wards as part of a contract with hm revenue and customs the reps typically ask for new mothers personal details which they can then sell on to third parties some new mothers have complained that they thought they were required to hand over their details in return for being given the forms which are free online or in post offices more than mps from across the political spectrum have signed a commons motion expressing concern that sales reps are allowed on to maternity wards and allowed to pass on advertising material and extract data from new mothers in order to sell it on to third parties the motion states that many new mothers believe they are giving their details to an official from the nhs according to the motion the nhs receives m a year in fees and equipment from bounty for access to maternity wards an hmrc spokesman said last year it paid bounty to distribute child benefit forms a spokeswoman from bounty said the clubs goal with hmrc was to make the child benefit form convenient for new parents to access and to provide value for money for hmrc and taxpayers distributing the form through bounty packs costs p per form if hmrc posted the forms individually the cost would rise to above p per form she said the provision of the child benefit form in our free packs ensures that the forms are put directly into the hands of parents and enables them to claim their child benefit as soon as their child is born our distribution of the forms means new parents do not have the burden of travelling to the post office as was previously the case or having to print off a form from the internet themselves she said bounty reps followed a strict code of conduct under which they were required to make it clear to parents that there was no requirement to give their personal details in return for a child benefit form an hmrc spokesman said bounty provided the government with an opportunity to get the latest child benefit claim forms directly to new mothers both quickly and costeffectively although the spokesman added that it was not the only way to obtain the form he said the government was monitoring the effectiveness of using bounty to ensure it delivers value for money and provides the best service to our customers critics are calling for child benefit claim forms to be given out when a birth is registered rather than through bounty reps vicky garner who started the petition calling for the hmrc to end its contract with bounty said an alarming number of new parents felt harassed and pestered by them even worse some are reporting being misled and disrespected at a time when they are at their most vulnerable one of the campaigns supporters amanda stevens described how hours after giving birth to her baby son in manchester three years ago she was asked for her details by a bounty rep i thought she must be a member of hospital staff and assumed i was being asked for information for official purposes it was only when she handed me a pack and left that i realised she said the thing that really riled me was that this woman took my data without telling me where she was from in may nhs officials were criticised for allowing salespeople access to mothers shortly after they have given birth dr margaret mccartney a glasgow gp questioned whether it was desirable for representatives from a promotions company to be allowed on nhs wards in an editorial published by bmjcom mccartney wrote that bounty profited by selling parents details she said the hours after birth were hardly an

im not proud of this but when i was a teenager my favourite moment in a film was when the heroine had a makeover you know the scene in which the leading lady is taught that the only way shell get ahead in life is if she gets rid of everything interesting about her and straightens her hair who could possibly object to that message so it should thrill my inner teenager that there has been a growing clamour for feminism to have a makeover take feminism out to rodeo drive these people cry take it to a fancy designer shop and get some rich guy with a credit card to buy it loads of ugly shoulderpadded jackets so it stops looking like a prostitute and now looks like ivana trump then it can live happily ever after with the man who paid to have sex with it thats the kind of thing feminism needs first up joss whedon now i have time for whedon sure his female characters spend an enormous amount of time being beaten up hello dollhouse or being devastated by male characters hi buffy but heck at least he isnt michael bay right and for the feminist fan of modern pop culture you have to be a glass halffull kinda person last week whedon announced that he hates the word feminist because he doesnt like how it sounds tonally its like watching a timelapse video of fresh bread in an oven being burned and because it infers that to believe in equality is not a natural state you cant be born an ist insists whedon who apparently hates the word feminist so much he has never read any feminist theory debating exactly this point instead he says its not feminism that needs a term but the state of not being a feminist that should be seen as the anomaly as with the term racist sexist just wont do for whedon for reasons too vague to elucidate here so he suggests genderist because it will contextualise the problem just as racism contextualised the problem not solved it mind racism isnt over despite its sonically pleasing term but contextualised it i personally dislike the term mansplaining because i find it with apologies to whedons ear sexist but rarely has there ever been a better example of the term to the tune of goldfinger mansplainer contrary to whedons sweetly naive view of humanity it is not mankinds natural tendency to see everyone as equal as the most skirting glance over history will prove rather humans have a remarkable tendency to try to subjugate one another for their personal advancement and selfvalidation whether this is natural is a tricky issue but then arguments about whats natural for humans have tended not to work out too well for women in the past as they generally devolve into discussions about women being put on earth to spread their legs and bear children on monday this week i received an email from lorraine candy editor of elle announcing that after her groundbreaking project involving three advertising agencies to rebrand feminism the fashion magazine is going to hold a conference on the subject this will certainly make noted modern thinker geri halliwell happy as she once posited feminism is braburning lesbianism its very unglamorous id like to see it rebranded we need to see a celebration of our femininity and softness braburning lesbianism the horror the horror no wonder elle needs to rebrand it so i called candy to discuss what precisely about feminism she felt needed rebranding was it getting a cosmetics range a diffusion line femme by feminist candy assures me that she is definitely a feminist and that this conference will not gussy up the name but rather discuss what feminism means to the modern woman what its rapidly beginning to mean to this modern woman is that its a word a lot of people in high places dont understand celebrities prove this on a weekly basis im not a feminist i love men lady gaga people think of feminism as being a load of strident bitches susan sarandon in any event feminism is already getting a makeover without whedon and elles help comedian and occasional guardian colleague bridget christie currently has a show in london in which she describes how magazines love it when she writes about feminism but theyd prefer shed talk about lena dunham instead of malala yousafzai because we want to use a photo of lena dunham you can even buy necklaces proclaiming your feminism which is surely the kind of celebration of our femininity and softness halliwell craved feminism is having a trendy moment you see so now it is being commercialised this is the equivalent of plucking the eyebrows of a very pretty girl in a movie so shes more acceptable to her stupid frat boy date leave her hairy leave her be i wish feminism were more complicated because it would explain why so many people misunderstand it but it is actually amazingly simple it is a belief in gender equality there are complications within it but thats all it is the reason it has a special name is because equality is not the human races default position and only a very wealthy white heterosexual man could possibly think otherwise as i grew older i came to like makeover scenes a lot less because it became obvious to me that it wasnt the woman who needed making over it was everyone else who needed an open mind feminism doesnt need a makeover a rebranding a softer sound or even a gold necklace some people just need an education,2013-11,im proud wa teenager favourite moment film wa heroine

tougher penalties for extremely violent rapes are to be introduced later this year the new chairman of the sentencing council lord justice treacy has revealed the appeal court judge this week starts work as head of the body that researches revises and sets out the underlying tariffs for punishments handed down by magistrates and judges across england and wales treacy a member of the sentencing council since its establishment in succeeds lord leveson who chaired the inquiry into phonehacking and media practices the next set of guidelines affecting individual offences relating to sexual crimes is due to be published in middecember the council has been working on the review for two years levels of sentencing in sexual offences have gone up in the last years we will be reflecting that increase in existing judicial practice treacy told the guardian we are not positively encouraging any additional increase because the practice of the courts has already been to recognise the need in certain classes of sexual offences to increase sentences but there is a specific example where we have taken a positive decision to increase sentences it relates to the extreme end of rape where it is associated with very severe violence we shall be recommending a starting point of years there whereas previously that sort of level of sentence would have been appropriate to a multiple rape scenario the guideline sentence for an extremely violent rape currently is a prison term of around years the move towards longer prison terms for sex offenders treacy believes is due to the criminal justice systems greater focus on the experience of victims in the last to years the justice system has recognised the position of the victim it didnt do so much in the past our guidelines focus much more on what has happened to the victim the work we do involves substantial consultations with victims groups so that we understand their view reforms introduced by the ministry of justice will soon enable victims to read out their personal impact statements in the courtroom once an offender has been convicted treacy wonders how many people will avail themselves of the opportunity given that a recent survey highlighted popular fears of speaking in public its not going to change the landscape of sentencing he said treacy started as a barrister in working from chambers in birmingham he became a high court judge in and an appeal court justice last year among notable cases over which he has presided was the trial and conviction last year of gary dobson and david norris for the murder of stephen lawrence in he heard the unusual case of the m robbery of the menzies world cargo warehouse at heathrow the first significant criminal trial to be heard in england without a jury for more than years chairmanship of the sentencing council is a parttime post and treacy will continue hearing appeal cases sentencing guidelines are not always revised upwards he pointed out we brought out guidelines a couple of years ago in relation to drugs mules people from third world countries are often under economic or greater pressure to smuggle drugs we made a positive recommendation that sentences for them should be reduced it was felt that people in that category were perhaps being oversentenced guidelines exist not just to improve the consistency of justice across the country but also so that they can be more readily understood by the public i dont think judges feel particularly constrained by the guidelines treacy said they are guidelines not tramlines the law is that a judge must follow the guidelines unless he or she considers it would not be in the interest of justice to do so judges are free to depart from the guidelines but if their reasons are not good enough their sentences may be varied by the appeal court my experience is that judges are comfortable with the guidelines the facts of every case are different before being introduced new guidelines are roadtested in mock trials to see if any snags or contradictions emerge the sentencing councils future programme of reports covers a range of criminal topics early next year we will be bringing out a guideline on environmental offences that started because we were approached about the problem of people dropping things such as mattresses in laybys it will also deal with other pollution offences and the dumping of toxic waste after that we are bringing out guidelines on corporate fraud offences that may be deal with by means of deferred prosecution agreements a new type of plea bargaining system to speed up complex commercial cases subsequent reports will look at theft offences ranging from pickpocketing to fraud by employees from their firms and the effect of guilty pleas on prison terms,2013-11,tougher penalty

mel clarke is a community development worker in a converted doubledecker bus providing mobile play facilities for children in rural areas around bath and northeast somerset established over years ago most of the community buss running costs were covered by local government grants from sure start and childrens centres now the charity only receives lottery funding and from the local authority clarke spends a lot of her time fundraising to make up the shortfall she says families are more reliant than ever on the bus as cuts elsewhere mean there are very few activities for children that are free especially in rural areas last year families visited the bus on a regular basis in different locations with high transport costs the bus is the only place where the underthrees in particular get to play and interact with other children parents and children have a lot fewer options available to them unless they can afford to pay for them says clarke and if families need more specialised services such as speech therapy there are often huge waiting lists some are over a year long for isolated rural families thats a long time to wait for help without any other support isolated clarke says her organisation feels more isolated too whereas previously the charity had regular contact with childrens centres that would help with sessions to promote healthy eating or how to encourage toddlers to talk now the bus has no such support from statutory services clarke is far from the only voluntary sector employee to feel services have deteriorated as a result of the coalition governments austerity agenda research published today by public services union unison shows that many people working on the frontline for community and voluntary organisations feel that their vulnerable clients are more at risk because of the cuts while employees themselves are increasingly having to take on additional jobs to make ends meet an online survey of just under unison members on the impact of cuts on the services they deliver and on themselves found that in childrens voluntary organisations of respondents were worried that children may be slipping through the net while said they do not have time to monitor children and follow up concerns of neglect or abuse in addition said they have no time to prepare risk assessments and support plans the survey was conducted in july and august among members delivering a range of voluntary services for children and disabled people and in housing and advocacy fields twothirds of respondents working for disability charities said clients were being left at risk because their care package has been reduced just under half said they had less time to spend with each client nearly threequarters of housing charity workers said more tenants were falling behind with rent with half reporting more people being evicted or forced to move by financial pressures and threequarters of workers in rights and advocacy community organisations said disabled elderly and minority ethnic people were disproportionately losing out from cuts to advice services this report lays bare the impact of austerity on services provided by the community and voluntary sector and on the workers for whom providing a service is not just a job but part of a deep personal commitment to the people they support says unisons general secretary dave prentis it is a wakeup call for politicians and society at large that workers in the community sector are approaching crisis point according to the local government association council budgets are being cut by in real terms between and and of total spending will have been taken out of adult social care in the three years since cuts were announced in councils are trying to protect social care budgets from the full force of the largest most sustained cuts in more than a generation says sir merrick cockell chair of the lga but with the equivalent of bn already taken from council funding and similar cuts to come some level of impact is unavoidable voluntary organisations play a vital role in identifying and supporting vulnerable people and councils value the strong relationships which exist between local government and the third sector workers in childrens charities feel that cuts are already jeopardising young peoples safety rachel jones is a specialist family support worker in birmingham waiting lists from referral to seeing one of her team have more than doubled from four months to nine months she says because other services have been cut there are fewer places we can refer people to for less specialist support while they wait so families are hitting crisis point unnecessarily in merseyside sally montgomery a retired worker for a supportedliving charity says levels of personal care for people with disabilities are compromised by very short flying visits and some things can be missed a simple thing such as not having time to wash your hands check meds check dates on the contents of a fridge spot a warning sign call something in can cause major problems or even fatalities she says then there are the risks taken when a task that requires two members of staff is being done by one this may result in injury to the care provider or recipient its wrong on all levels and its getting worse every day the survey also highlighted the stark economic situation many workers in the voluntary and community sector find themselves in a quarter of respondents do not earn the living wage an hour outside london in london are on zerohours contracts and onefifth have seen a reduction in their takehome pay as a result have debts of more than many are having to take on extra work with holding down more than one job and juggling four or more jobs unison is calling for urgent action to tackle low pay and zerohours contracts and for management to listen to the fears and concerns of its workforce it wants legal protection for charity workers who whistleblow about the poor quality of services they are asked to deliver it also wants a commission of inquiry to be set up to examine the impact of the coalitions austerity measures on the community and voluntary sector which seeks evidence from frontline workers for many care workers the strain is already proving too much of respondents say they plan to quit their job in the next year it is a sent iment montgomery understands all too well i went into care work because i loved it it was the lowest paid work ive ever done under the worst conditions but it was also the most rewarding and satisfying i was passionate about it and i know that i made a great difference to the lives of those i worked with but eventually i was burnt out and took retirement,2013-11,mel clarke community development worker converted doubledecker bus providing mobile play

single parents with already stretched finances are bearing the brunt of government changes to benefits charities have warned when many are already struggling with huge increases to household bills among our clients single parents have the highest levels of rent council tax and water arrears says ed ware for debt charity stepchange the pressure on household finances can be acute with energy bills now a big worry despite these parents already facing substantial difficulties balancing the rising cost of living with childcare all on just one income latest figures from the office for national statistics show that singleparent households make up a quarter of the total number of householdsin england and wales the labour government attempted to improve the finances of the million single parent families through a raft of measures in its familyfirst budget which included the new deal for lone parents scheme to help people back into work however the coalition government has declared that once a single parents youngest child turns five they are no longer entitled to income support and must seek work or take up a job or face having their benefits dramatically cut but single parents say the obstacles they face to finding work with childcare and flexible working demands have not changed dee hathaway is mum to jude five and earns around a month working parttime for a nursery she says her greatest financial strain comes from funding childcare during school holidays when the nursery she works at remains open it costs me around upfront my monthly salary to put jude into a holiday club for a month meaning summer holidays can be a financial nightmare she says i might resort to candles if gas and electricity goes up any more she claims tax credits housing and council tax benefit and working tax credits which will be replaced by a single payment through the universal credit while she would like to take a training course offered by her employer and increase her hours this would see her financially worse off due to the current benefits system id be worse off by between to a month because of benefit cuts which is crazy universal credit charities say changes to benefits fail to honour the governments pledge to make work pay for single parentsuniversal credit which is being rolled out across the country is set to gradually replace six meanstested benefits by but calculations from the charity gingerbread show that on average single parents working on the minimum wage will lose just over a year under the scheme compared with the current system as part of the changes parents who receive help towards childcare through tax credits will receive up to of these costs under universal credit but those earning less than a year the threshold for paying income tax will receive only towards their childcare costs a gingerbread spokesman says work has to be a route out of poverty for single parents but weve found that under universal credit not only will they lose out on average they will also struggle to increase their income by taking on extra hours the government must ensure singleparent families get the financial support they need to enter and progress in work and with a delay in the rollout of universal credit theres now time to make that happen childcare voucher scheme for families not claiming universal credit or working tax credit the government has said that it will phase out the employersupported childcare voucher scheme and replace it with a taxfree voucher of up to a year per child that can be claimed online unlike the current system this will be available to all working parents rather than dependent on whether their employer offers a scheme anand shukla chief executive of charity family and childcare trust says the proposed taxfree childcare scheme provides additional welcome financial support for childcare costs but there are major question marks over the proposed distribution of this funding support is increased for those on higher incomes but is not extended to the poorest working parents who are more likely to be single parents the new scheme will enable working parents including the selfemployed earning up to each to claim back of the first of childcare costs per child which according to the government is the average annual price of a childcare place shukla says as tax free childcare will be limited to of costs a parent would need to spend to be eligible for the full amount so few families will actually receive per child the system which is expected to be implemented in autumn will initially apply to children up to five years old but will be extended over time to include those up to the age of years the vouchers can also only be used to pay for childcare registered with ofsted in england and the equivalent bodies in scotland wales and northern ireland some parents may have to decide between extra cash in their pockets and retaining their nonregistered child carer who may be a friend or family member parents will have to register online with a voucher company and pay into an account for every paid in the government will add up to a maximum a year,2013-11,single parent

i grew up in one of those secretly unhappy postwar australian families there were many my mothers bitter resentment of womens lot and the humiliations women put up with in those deceptively stable s families were expressed in the background noise or the menacing silence of depression and discontent there were few hugs in my first home in the end she was almost constantly absent leaving us in favour of her busy gynaecological practice our large suburban house doubled as my fathers surgery and his assumption that he was entitled to have sex with some of his patients was probably not uncommon at the time it was my mother who told me that on one occasion a patient spraypainted pay by intercourse high on the wall of our home when she asked what happened to the woman he told her hed had her certified of course when i left school at i fled the lies and hypocrisies of my childhood as fast as i could in search of something quite different yet without any sense of what this might be entering sydney university that same year i quickly bonded with the small group of anarchists i met there known as the sydney libertarians and linked with an older flagrantly dissident group the push it was the early s a time when the wider world still disapproved of women having sex before marriage and australia was one of the most sexually censorious countries in the developed world but the antiutopian pessimistic anarchists i stumbled across were firm believers in free love for several years around my early s i was never alone if i didnt want to be i had a series of relationships which usually ended when the men moved on to study abroad or one of us changed direction i had experienced sexual pressure in more respectable settings when i was younger at parties while still at school but i never felt sexually coerced or exploited even now i sympathise with my younger needier self always able to find intimacy if a solitary evening loomed later approaching my mids i distanced myself from the unadorned living hard drinking and anarchist politics of the push with its firm belief in personal autonomy dissent and contempt for authoritarian institutions of every stripe i was charmed by the artistic counterculture then growing up in sydney inspired by the utopian writing of marshall mcluhan and buckminster fullers ideas about using technology as a tool for radical social change in this space of subversive happenings and ephemeral publications i met a few of the most dynamic young artists of the time including the one i would end up having to marry i met james clifford when he came up to me at a sydney gallery and said thats a kinky dress he was different from all the other tough young men id been surrounded by he was elegant careful about his appearance the relationship lasted for more than three years with much mutual love and admiration yet it was more unstable than any i had known this was not just because he was fragile temperamentally incapable of earning a living or keeping himself out of trouble but because his deepest inclinations were homosexual in i became pregnant accidentally and after our son was born he became more and more distressed displaying an intense possessiveness and throwing tantrums although he no longer felt able to sleep with me he would get hysterical if a male friend came to visit and tried to keep me all to himself yet he cherished our relationship because he had internalised the homophobic culture of the times and also because he did in his way love us both what had i done at the close of the s i once more found myself in a tiny family suffused with deception and suffering just like the home i grew up in i had finished university but had as yet no means of supporting myself my partner or our child for all our sexual freedom we women had few female guides or gurus as we listened to odetta or janis joplin belting out their blues the anguished suffering of heroines created by the few contemporary female novelists from simone de beauvoir and doris lessing to margaret drabble or shelagh delaney was just as discouraging for any woman seeking inspiration on how to lead a freer more authentic life by i still knew no woman who could face the world and speak boldly in her own right with the ambiguous exception of de beauvoir who had explicitly rejected the possibility of having children no wonder we were growing confused i had yet to meet a woman who did not feel in some buried and resentful way or quite explicitly as my mother had that it was pitiable to exist as a woman without a man in i fled from my marriage to london with my infant son zimri james followed us to england and i ended up paying for him to go back i found that the sense of being lost lonely and bewildered which i thought i had brought upon myself in fleeing respectability turned out to be far from unusual with better education more of us were noticing the domestic isolation and contempt that shadowed womens lives encountering the antiwar or student politics of the late s also opened our eyes to its blatant machismo with womens voices frequently ignored if not greeted with aggressive derision something had to give and very quickly women began to organise for themselves meeting and campaigning seeking new lives and relationships to encompass our diverse but distinctive concerns it was the state of family life and womens frequently isolated undervalued and subordinate place within it that first captured the attention of radical women this meant that in many ways the s would prove the friendliest decade ever for young mothers eager for change with a little help from our friends it was single mothers who could now escape the traditional labels of fallen or abandoned women to become the immediate beneficiaries of womens liberation women with children as my friend sheila rowbotham later observed were our equivalent to the marxist proletariat the vanguard of the womens movement this did not mean that it would be easy to solve the perennial problem of forming loving relationships and finding ways of supporting ourselves of combining intimacy motherhood and paid work while also adding on our community and political involvements on arriving in london i got a teaching job and by i was living in a large rambling dilapidated house in islington which i had bought with my sister and in which i still live today for a few years it was home to three single mothers alison noreen and me with our children no rent was paid and the three or four other women or men who at different times moved in and out of the house shared all household tasks contrary to later mythology men were entangled with feminism from the start as straight women struggled with them often successfully over housework childcare and much else we had few problems with domestic rotas but there were no political solutions to individual heartaches and frustration even among women who tried and all too often failed to avoid causing them this left a shared household of mainly female friends not unlike siblings vulnerable to jealousies and sexual tension especially if sexually entangled with the same men or occasionally women i was never without a sexual partner during these years and for brief periods fearful either of rejection or causing pain myself i rather surreptitiously had two however i was so busy anchoring myself in this left feminist milieu long nights at the kitchen table drinking red wine and smoking rollups planning our next campaign trying to feel secure in my somewhat fraught and never completely stable household that the comings and goings of lovers merged into the domestic and political routines although i despaired when they failed i was never exclusively dependent on a man as couples we were never isolated always surrounded by other people engaged in various forms of activism i was happy because my son seemed happy thrived and was popular at school despite its shifting nature and somewhat spartan comforts communal living suited me well especially the relaxed atmosphere that prevailed in my sons teenage years after the two single mothers had fallen out and departed i lived with three male friends one of whom had been briefly my boyfriend and another who remained my lover for nine years all of us members of the small left feminist group big flame my lover was a wonderful homemaker and did most of the cooking and household renovations he was also completely committed to sharing the care of my son with zim now the only child in the house he had three big brothers i seemed to have accidentally abolished fathers though this was not for me an ideological stance by the time i was in my early s i had started a relationship with peter who was years younger than me and rejected the communal setup for a more traditional model one of my lodgers moved into the attic another into the basement and the third into his own flat as i began living in tightly bonded coupledom as ever id managed to get conventions the wrong way around again loving and looking up to a man so much my junior in the years we lived as a couple i felt that we gave each other incalculable intellectual and emotional support the relationship lasted for years until he around fell in love with someone else when we first moved in together he was only and not ready for fatherhood although i would have had a child with him if i had got pregnant after we settled down together now in his s he was becoming broody in my late s i was left aching and grieving for him and the life we had shared it was the year the new millennium had arrived with everything once more seeming askew for some years i joined that evergrowing number of middleaged women facing life on their own as another highly successful acquaintance of mine commented soon after the departure of her own longtime partner for a younger woman i went to the theatre the other night and saw in the queue ahead so many women i knew all now single and i said to myself this is a group i never wanted to join definitely a group most of us never wanted to join though one that older women will find it very hard to leave given that the odds against them coupling up again could hardly be longer i sense this is despite and perhaps partly because of their status charms and by all standards other than youth their physical attractiveness the negative stereotypes of old age remain distinct and far more damaging in relation to women the very autonomy and independence we fought for has been one reason it became easier for a man to leave a partner who could now survive alone today by the age of more than twice as many women as men are single older men are often living with younger women which is why twice as many young men as young women live alone the question is whatever the reason for joining that group can older single women embrace life without feeling diminished is the sense of lack we might experience made all the harder by being identified as pitiable i certainly found perhaps because my mothers voice still resonates in my head that it can be hard to stifle a certain sense of shame stay young and beautiful if you want to be loved we sang this as young women on the first international womens day procession in london in march i was there but few of us singing along on that bright day could appreciate what many of us would later experience as the bitter gravity of the message in our s and s feminists like me felt we understood the maledefined ephemeral nature of beauty and we disdained cosmetic embellishments yet this did little to prepare us for most of the challenges of ageing as we are rendered increasingly invisible by middle age for certain all those friends we cultivated make a difference i could not have recovered from the heartache of losing peter without their support yet valuable as friends are there are limits to what we can expect from them inside the sanctified region of the couple whatever its joys sorrows or fragilities one knows one is allowed to love even if onesidedly but there are few agreed codes for friendship one of the most distressing letters i ever received was from a new friend expressing anger that i had assumed an unwarranted sense of entitlement i have noticed older single people avoiding new close friendships to protect themselves from the possibility of hurt whether from hoping for too much or giving too little nevertheless old friendships do endure allaying the loneliness that often threatens to engulf us i have the strong impression that many if not most older single women barely dare express what may be their frustrated sexual longings complex as these are how can they not fear arousing the distinct cultural abhorrence reserved for ageing female flesh in all its mythic monstrosity the humiliations an old woman can expect when she seeks a partner in a straight world mean that it is often better far better to act as though she no longer desires at all i suspect this lies behind many older women quite unlike men declaring theyre no longer interested in sex it provides protection from the crippling fear of rejection or worse if an older woman acknowledges her erotic desire still after all these years i refuse to give up on desire trying to grasp its intricate continuities and discontinuities over a long life agnes was head of a gender programme at trondheim university and asked me to open a conference she was organising on sexuality i had agreed though as the date approached i was working on a new book and told her i wanted to pull out she was furious and i ended up going along and talking about ageing at a dinner at her place that evening it was clear she fancied me which made me very happy although on that first cheerful somewhat drunken evening together i was probably slightly flirting with everyone when agnes came to london two weeks later she stayed with me and very casually at first we slept together that was eight years ago and we remain a couple living together apart i am far from the only older woman to have found love and renewed physical pleasure in physical intimacy with another woman sadly in my case my partner lives and works much of the time in norway yet even though we see each other only every six weeks she has enabled me to experience more sexual pleasure than i have known before and to see myself as desirable in different ways the desire to be desired is always a key aspect of sexuality and certainly of mine and when you feel desired at any age you are back in touch with all those younger selves you have been across a lifetime despite all the pitfalls of life and love i find that most of the political commitments i made as a young woman still sustain me in old age feminism has given me a language for recognising rather than disavowing the vulnerabilities we all experience whatever our age hope can live with apprehension in love and in politics as together we shrink those generational divisions erected all around us out of time the pleasures and the perils of ageing by lynne segal is published

its always been a feminist organisation but i think maybe when it started it was stealth feminism caroline brooks is a member of the sewing bee which is a subgroup of the shoreditch sisters which is at the vanguard of the womens institute new wave they meet near haggerston and they were established in by jazz domino holly who founded sew out of control a website where crafts meet rocknroll and the following information is not relevant to the wi is the daughter of joe strummer it all sounds a bit cool im sick of us being labelled as being cool because were really not caroline says and i dont like the look on peoples faces when they meet us and realise that madeline colborn adds they sew but they also knit at knit and natter and cycle with radiant riders and taste beer swig for victory they have a radio show on hoxton radio there is much more stitching them together though than their shared activities and love of alliteration theyre all friends but its more than organised friendship there is a palpable likemindedness a set of shared assumptions that go beyond i assume youre going to put some tunisian crochet in that patchwork quilt i dont really get it i dont understand how you campaign about issues and agree on those issues without having an articulated political standpoint but they understand it and theyre the ones campaigning as wi has been for years martha wass the yearold president of the group was in the middle of making a fascinator elsewhere i saw someone crocheting a bra which should really be new grist to the mill of brabased feminist disparagement i met the shoreditch sisters at an event says martha ive never met a nicer group of people in my life they had so much to say they were so intelligent and i cant think youd find that in a dance class or a gym for some there is a straight altruistic curve between crafting and cooperating thirtyfiveyearold jamila i thought i was going to be the youngest member by two decades it turns out im actually midrange describes it if ive got a skill i want to pass it on for others its a symbiotic process a campaigning idea might be expressed through craft lets say youre making a patchwork quilt out of embroidered vulvas to protest against female genital mutilation and then in the act of crafting the idea finds new expression martha explains about the vulva quilt workshop they ran for the secret cinema people are attracted to it they want to make they sit down they get their things and then we start to talk and then they get to know all about fgm and whats happening and this she underlines has always been part of the wi it is truly astonishing what youll find in their booklet of resolutions in view of the recent nuclear disaster in chernobyl this meeting urges the government world to declare a moratorium on the development of nuclear power as early as they were calling for equal pay but lest you mistake this for lefties in craftclothing it was not all progressive in the motion was passed this meeting remembers that our young queen had duties as a wife and mother and urges the nation as a whole not to overwork her majesty we probably still havent achieved that said madeline she works like a dog and beyond the clear trajectory whereby nice people just inexorably do nice things for the less fortunate there is a profound philosophical point caroline says that was the big generational divide between our mothers and their mothers sod this im going to buy everything versus make do and mend we have more in common with earlier generations than we do with baby boomers we just dont have their plenty im anticonsumerist not prothrift i love clothes but i dont want disposable clothes its about the pride of making stuff rather than having stuff,2013-11,always feminist

absolutely not i definitely wouldnt call myself a feminist began angela epstein on newsnight on tuesday answering a question from presenter emily maitlis about whether shed describe herself as a feminist the journalist and broadcaster offered up a wistful eulogy to the ghosts of feminism past and bemoaned the deterioration of the movement apparently one woman under the kings horse was more than enough to secure feminist victory for all time women she reminded us now have the vote some women have even got the vote a career and shiny hair this is great news but someone really ought to pass it on to the grumpy women in bad clothes who according to epstein have bastardised feminism and committed the even graver offence of being poorly coiffed in the process theres no need to defend feminism from tired arguments such as this epstein was invited on newsnight alongside mary beard and natasha mcelhone to provide the obligatory counterpoint to the feminist strand of the debate and she is patently wrong the imbalanced distribution of wealth and power between men and women is proof enough of feminisms legitimacy and for those who still need convincing personal testimony via movements such as everyday sexism paints an even more vivid picture of the prejudices that todays feminists have to combat from within a feminist bubble its tempting to imagine that epstein is just hollering into the void from her little soapbox and that her pointless polemics about being disqualified from the sisterhood for having a career are falling on deaf ears but if we think this way well be sabotaging our own cause epsteins views reflect a wider neurosis about the meaning of feminism rather than just shouting her down we need to ask why such distrust still persists and what we can do to dispel it in an article she wrote for the daily mail after her newsnight appearance epstein paints a picture of a feminism set on taking from her the things she holds dearest her husband her pride in being a mother and her daughters right to play with dolls as early as the first sentence she notes that her blowdried hair should be evidence enough that shes no feminist its the kind of remark that make women up and down the country collectively facepalm we mustnt laugh though these sorts of imagined dichotomies are more common than we might like to believe i have heard young women say that they wouldnt be a feminist because they love their boyfriends or because they like to look sexy or because they want to be a mother feminism apparently has been kept at arms length by those for whom its a pejorative term and shoehorned into the twin cones of madonnas pointy bra it is seen as limiting by as many women as find it empowering rather than ruing the fact that so many seem to have missed the memo which explained how feminism is necessary and liberating we need to take responsibility for handdelivering its message we need to understand womens reasons for recoiling from the word feminism listen to their concerns and see what we can do to be make the movement more inclusive im not suggesting that we dumb down the message abandon our demands or compromise on our principles but we do need to take time to listen and to explain in the meantime angela epstein has unwittingly exposed herself as just kind of person she abhors the woman who thinks that career and family shouldnt be mutually exclusive the woman who wants to achieve on her own terms and who expects the freedom to dress as she wants without being reduced to a stereotype sorry to break it to you angela but i think you might be a feminist too,2013-11,absolutely definitely wouldnt call feminist began angela epstein newsnight tuesday answering question presenter emily maitlis whether shed describe feminist

i thought i had heard enough febrile hyperbolic pronouncements on modern masculinity to get me through any year but i had not counted on camille paglia in an interview with the wall street journal the maverick libertarian feminist pondered the implications of the feminisation of society and the devaluing of traditional masculine values what youre seeing is how a civilisation commits suicide she declared paglia is not a lone cassandra hanna rosin and christina hoffsommers have written on the end of men and the war on men and boys respectively this year diane abbott warned of a crisis of masculinity that is seeing her young male constituents in hackney corrupted by hardcore pornography and a viagra and jack daniels culture from north america to europe to oceania masculinity is being prodded pathologised diagnosed and bemoaned by voices from across the political cultural and social spectrum the great irony is that the overwhelming majority of these voices are female most men instinctively know why this would be it is the first rule of fight club after all mens concerns interests anxieties or even pride in our own gender roles are typically sheltered by the conceits of fiction as seen in the exquisite hour thesis on modern masculinity that was breaking bad or filtered through protective layers of irony and humoursocial media users recently parodied the internal travails of feminism with the hashtag meninisttwitter but behind the walls of laddish banter and sexism there were some very real anxieties and resentments on display the sledgehammers and stilettos of a gendered society impact upon and are wielded by every man woman and child women and feminists in particular have spent centuries developing the vocabulary to discuss the myriad ways in which their lives are affected by gender constraints and crucially they have carved the space in which to host those discussions men too often mutter into our pints and change the subject this goes a long way to explaining why men vastly outnumber women in the figures for hazardous alcohol and drug abuse it is why so many men in psychological crisis end up in a police cell rather than a gps surgery at the sharpest end it may be why men are around three times more likely to take their own lives than women one organisation dealing with the fallout of this is the mental health charity calm the campaign against living miserably in an attempt to turn around selfdestructive male habits they have announced that will be the year of the male months of campaigning debate and discussion aimed at changing both public opinion and public policy towards male genderspecific issues there will be a stateofnation audit of modern masculinity and a public campaign inviting men to share their stories and experiences calms director jane powell says we think its time to ask some big questions about men and work health the media education relationships and family and ask what it really means to be man enough separately the southbank centre recently announced a major festival at the end of january entitled being a man in which voices as diverse as jon snow baaba maal and grayson perry will contribute to a weekend of performance and conversations on how mens roles are evolving all this leaves hanging a central question of whether examining debating and discussing masculinity will actually do anything to change the habits and behaviours of men themselves or societys expectations and obligations the supposed crisis of masculinity is largely a crisis in economics and employment education and social policy health and social service delivery those are not issues that can be solved with an introspective healing circle identifying and addressing those problems means changing how we behave as men and towards men if that means the end of civilisation as we know it then perhaps it is a model of civilisation that needs to go,2013-12,thought heard enough febrile hyperbolic

jeanette winterson author my new years resolution is simple you dont have to play by other peoples rules but you have to play by your own i want to be clear about what i believe and uphold those values in private and in public this government is so shoddy and the ethos of the time so selfserving it is important to work out what is important living consciously has never mattered more bridget christie comedian i have only one resolution this year to reserve judgment on a thing or a person until i have tasted it read it heard it seen it used it done it or met them personally thingspeople exempt from this are jellied eels george osborne katie hopkins kim jongun boris johnson boiled rat and colonic irrigation camila batmanghelidjh founder of kids company tens of billions of pounds is set aside to defend the country but are we preparing for the right kind of war when children at kids company were interviewed by ucl researchers half said they had witnessed shootings and stabbings in the past year they describe themselves as soldiers surviving their childhood in violent neighbourhoods where firearms are as accessible as a cup of tea some m children fight a war on want they lack the basics a winter coat or a bed to sleep on guess my wish caroline criadoperez campaigner my first new years resolution is to know that its ok to say no to realise that i can no longer control my image but have to let it all go sometimes and not panic so much about the fact that people who dont know me hate me my second resolution is more ideological over the past year there has been an increasing split in the feminist movement accompanied by frenzied attacks on women who dont toe the arbitrary invisible line this has led to feminists standing by as men verbally abuse the wrong feminists under the guise of progressiveness my feminism is about recognising that all women are oppressed by virtue of being women and that abuse from men is unacceptable under any circumstances my feminism is not about denouncing other feminists so i resolve to stop engaging with those who do suzanne moore columnist my new years resolution is to get up yas necati campaigner and student this year i want to meet as many new feminists as possible we all have different ideas about what feminism means to us i hope to listen to and understand as many different perspectives as possible because were only going to win this battle if we all learn to accept one anothers differences that way we can all move forward together nicola horlick financier the only way that i can totally forget about work is when i am skiing the beautiful vistas and fresh air leave me totally reinvigorated and mentally fitter to face all the business challenges that i have to deal with over the rest of the year one year i was too busy to get really fit for skiing and i managed to snap a ligament in my knee on the first day of a twoweek holiday reconstructive surgery followed and my knee still aches at the end of a busy day i have learned my lesson and the exercise regime that is necessary to get fit for skiing will be top of my agenda on january natasha walter writerdirector of women for refugee women i always make new years resolutions i love feeling that i can make a new start in i am going to be focused on challenging the detention of women who come to this country to seek safety from persecution thousands of women are being traumatised and tormented by being locked up in the uk for no reason my resolution is to end the detention of women seeking asylum failing that ill settle for opening more peoples eyes to this scandal i am also resolving to spend more time with my children and my partner in the open air in the park by the sea in the hills no screens no tweets no headphones just sun and rain and fun thandie newton actor my resolution is to help create a platform for one billion rising for justice on february v days global day of action in an effort to end violence against women and girls katharine whitehorn writer having got a bigger and bigger handbag as time goes on the time has come for reform in the brave new year it will always have my glasses in the pocket where they are supposed to be the keys ditto and that small disapprovedof tiny bottle of oh well you know but also something anything to read i want never again to have to borrow something on a train from a stranger in the next seat who has nothing but impenetrable stuff about things in the city going up or down when you find yourself reading the stuff on the back of a sweet packet you know that in the next year something must be done bim adewunmi writer mine is to do more away from my keyboard in the community i want to get involved in literacy programmes in my east london neighbourhood rather than just write about library closures and cuts harriet harman deputy labour leader the same as everyone elses take more exercise drink less alcohol and eat more healthily whats really good

lucy powell is fighting back tears as she hears the story of a young single mother whose children would have been taken into care but for the tough love of an outreach worker on a pioneering early intervention scheme in manchester as her youngest child made a lunge for the chocolate biscuits at the rusholme childrens centre in moss side nura omar tells labours shadow childcare minister that her family would have been broken up without her outreach worker grace if it were not for grace i would have lost my kids by now omar says but grace kept coming round to my house and told me to be strong she even told me i could go back to college omar and two of her children aged nine months and two years are the stars of a briefing for powell at the childrens centre on a new scheme in manchester that brings together midwives health visitors and outreach workers to identify parents and babies in need in conventional early intervention projects the three sets of professionals rarely share information which means health visitors have been known to set up stalls at the nappy stand in asda to identify expectant mothers in need of help but the intelligence sharing in manchesters new common assessment framework means help can be targeted at mothers long before their child is born at their regular joint meetings midwives can tip off health visitors or outreach workers if for example they believe a mother is living in unsatisfactory conditions it was a bit more hit and miss powell says of the old system under the scheme every new mother is visited eight times from about weeks before the birth of their child until just before the childs fifth birthday the professionals the midwives health visitors and outreach workers then hold fortnightly common assessment framework meetings where they assess whether more help is needed for a particular child or mother its always been the panacea of public services this kind of joinedup working at a grassroots level powell told the guardian in the past there wasnt that joinedup working so people were working in parallel the same family might be seen by various services at different times but no one was looking at that holistically what that family what that child and their parents might need collectively and then being able to help them it been a real shift of focus about what the outcomes are that are being desired and also a way of really tracking and monitoring that that is driving together joinedup working powell who is mp for manchester central stresses that this is targeted on the basis of need not deprivation mental health is critical and thats not an issue of deprivation many mums get postnatal depression middle class mums as well just as much middle class mums might be struggling with parenting this is is not about targeting on deprivation its targeting on need manchester city council which introduced the streamlined system as the city copes with budget cuts believes it is producing results jenny andrews the councils assistant director of education and skills said faced with a reduction in resources one of the things you have to do is think big and think differently that is what we are doing it is a universal model but it is targeted where more help is needed powell who was promoted to her frontbench role in labours autumn reshuffle less than a year after her election as mp for manchester central in a byelection believes the citys innovative scheme has broader lessons for the provision of public services on a national level the council whose leader sir richard leese is regarded as one of labours most effective leaders beyond westminster was not frittering away cash before the new scheme powell believes the changes show how services can be improved on a tighter budget without cutting sure start centres it is a big leap we do need to have some big ideas rather than just incrementally trying to shave off around the edges by closing sure start centres or having reduced services powell said what manchester has tried to do which i think is really important to me as a national politician is to just flip the whole thing on its head and develop a much bigger vision that has been much harder work to pull together and has had tough decisions involved in it in order that the services can be brought together and the resources can be put where needed to make that system work really powell who recently returned to work after maternity leave after the birth of her first child believes the foresight of manchester will help her as she works deliver universal free preschool childcare this will eventually pay for itself as mothers return to work just as the manchester scheme will pay for itself by identifying problems early on the really big leap that manchester is taking is the idea that this will actually pay for itself targeting resources on this early intervention will save the council money later on,2013-12,lucy powell fighting

labour is to pursue the policy of universal childcare for all preschool children in the runup to the general election as ed miliband pledges in his new year message on monday to make childcare one of his priorities if he is elected as prime minister the shadow minister with responsibility for the issue has made the case for the introduction of free universal provision in a guardian interview the shadow childcare minister lucy powell said of free universal preschool childcare id love it to be introduced my job is to make the political and economic case for childcare not just the childcare offer that we have right now but an extension of that i am absolutely firmly of the belief that if you invest in childcare it pays for itself over time because it increases maternal employment rates the remarks by powell are the strongest indication that the labour leadership would like to take a dramatic step on childcare at a cost of billions of pounds though powell insists the state would eventually reap savings as women return to the workforce in greater numbers labour is already committed to using a levy on banks to provide hours of free childcare a week for working parents with three and fouryearolds worth it is also to offer wraparound provision between am and pm from breakfast to afterschool clubs in primary schools the coalition has introduced hours of free childcare for parents with three and fouryearold children for weeks a year powell who was milibands deputy chief of staff before she became mp for manchester central said she would probably phase universal free childcare in over longer than a parliament its very expensive i mean its certainly not something you could deliver anyway overnight those kind of goals would be year strategies to get there but you need to think about those steps that you take along the way and making sure that they are getting you there rather than not getting you there powells comments came as miliband said in his new year video message people dont want the earth theyd much prefer some very specific promises specific things about what a government will do whether its freezing energy bills taking action on payday lenders or tackling issues around childcare which lots of working parents face all of this is adding up to a programme for how we can change things its clearly costed its credible and its real milibands new year message is designed to show he has plans to broaden his cost of living campaign after his pledge at the labour conference to freeze energy bills for months the labour leader wants to show that he will not just offer oneoff pledges but will deliver proposals to change the economic face of britain powell said universal free preschool childcare would have a deep impact on the wellbeing of children as well as on the economy weve got some of the worst maternal employment rates in the oecd countries she said enabling women to go back to work who want to go back to work in the same jobs they were doing before so that they dont pay that pay and status penalty for the rest of their careers will increase revenues to the exchequer significantly such that over time it pays for itself powell says universal childcare would work alongside a transformation of the sure start services for babies and young children in manchester the labourcontrolled council has introduced a system in which midwives health visitors and outreach workers sit down together and identify parents and children in need under what is known as a common assessment framework under the current nationwide system the three groups work in parallel and often do not share information powell said i think effective universal but also targeted early intervention work can more than pay for itself over time in those situations this avoids being scaled up to crisis later on in that child or familys life and costing the state a hell of a lot more labour is waiting for the publication of a report on childcare by the institute for public policy research ippr due to be published in the new year in an interim report published earlier this month the ippr said a wideranging expansion of childcare would pay for itself over time it estimated that attracting mothers back into the workforce would generate an extra bn in tax revenues and make savings in benefit payments,2013-12,labour pursue policy universal childcare

mps from all parties are backing a tough usstyle law that would make domestic abuse a specific offence carrying a sentence of up to years in prison a new bill sponsored by the justice unions group and the all party group on stalking and harassment would for the first time make sentences reflect whether domestic abuse both physical and psychological was part of a pattern of behaviour it is modelled on legislation introduced in the us that has resulted in a dramatic increase in convictions and reporting of domestic abuse it follows on from a successful campaign to bring in new stalking laws in england and wales that were introduced to parliament in similar fashion at present there is no specific offence of domestic abuse as defined by criminal law instead offenders are prosecuted for crimes such as rape or assault however in many cases the police courts and prosecutors fail to take into account the previous abusive behaviour of an offender experts such as the probation service union napo say this is a concern because it is rare for domestic abuse to be confined to just one incident now the proposed law would provide a legal framework that would make domestic abuse a specific offence and would allow for the examination of an offenders course of conduct over a period of time supporters say this would encourage more women to report a crime that is often neglected by the criminal justice system sometimes with tragic consequences research shows that the average victim does not report abuse until subjected to at least incidents only of reports to police result in arrest and only one in six reports lead to a charge the law would see domestic abuse categorised as both physical and psychological and perpetrated against the victim or the victims children it would define abuse as intentionally wilfully or recklessly causing or attempting to cause physical injury or psychological harm to a person and introduce protective orders prohibiting an abuser from making contact with their victim it is extraordinary that domestic abuse is not a criminal offence in the uk said harry fletcher a criminal justice expert and adviser to napo who drafted the bill as a consequence reporting is low and behaviour is missed by workers in the justice system conviction rates are appallingly low at the police and the crown prosecution service tend to deal with the matter before them and not longterm repetitive abusive behaviour this bill will make domestic abuse an offence with a maximum sentence of up to years in prison it will be the first time that an attempt will be made to criminalise a course of domestic abuse in this country the bills supporters believe that it will enjoy broad support in parliament and is likely to become law since similar laws were introduced in the us reporting of domestic abuse has increased by nearly incidents of violence have decreased by more than a third ensuring that domestic abuse is recognised in both psychological and physical terms has already been broadly welcomed by senior police officers domestic abuse is characterised by a catalogue of incidents a pattern of behaviour which can include coercive control and emotional blackmail as well as physical violence said elfyn llwyd the plaid cymru mp who is presenting the bill to parliament it was positive that the association of chief police officers last year amended their definition of domestic abuse to have regard of this fact but it is high time that the criminal law was also amended so that domestic abuse was made a criminal offence in its own right according to the home office some million women in the uk said they had experienced domestic abuse last year two out of three incidents involved repeat victims two women are killed by a partner expartner or lover each week last year women were sexually assaulted of whom were victims of rape or attempted rape but the true number of victims is likely to be even higher research carried out by citizens advice estimates that more than half a million victims of domestic abuse are too frightened to report their experiences,2013-12,mp party backing tough usstyle law would make domestic abuse specific offence carrying

last week tony abbott flanked by the actor hugh jackman and his wife adoption advocate deborralee furness announced that the government would be taking steps to make it much much easier for australian couples to adopt from overseas he spoke of the millions of children in orphanages overseas who would love to have parents adding that thousands of those maybe even tens of thousands of those could come to australia and we need to make it easier for that to happen abbott promised speedy action guaranteeing change within months he announced the formation of a taskforce to report in march on immediate steps to make intercountry adoption easier and faster for australian couples he also reported that his government was considering capping the length of time agencies have to process adoption applications to make it easier and faster for couples to adopt domestically and from overseas but is faster easier adoption better adoption my colleagues and i have recently completed a study titled the market in children stories of australian adoption and for historians the scene on the steps of kirribilli house evoked a strong sense of dj vu abbott has a long history as a promoter of adoption notably as an alternative to abortion in he introduced to the australian public the son he had relinquished to adoption years earlier living proof of the virtues of the adoption solution the man later turned out to be the child of another man the year also saw bronwyn bishops parliamentary inquiry into overseas adoption in australia the inquiry produced a detailed set of recommendations intended to speed up the process of adoption by removing bureaucratic roadblocks internationally and within australia as a result responsibilities are more clearly assigned state welfare departments are responsible for the placement of children and the assessment of intending parents the federal attorney general has the job of making sure that all adoptions are compliant with international standards a responsibility which covers the process both in australia and in the country of adoption paradoxically this has resulted in a highlyregulated regime and new delays for people wanting to adopt given the governments distaste for market controls abbotts new taskforce may be intended to undo some of this regulation this would fly in the face of recent revelations of corruption in the intercountry adoption market of orphanages selling children without consent of their parents and worse instances of criminal gangs kidnapping children for overseas adoption children adopted into countries like america and australia have been claimed by parents from whom they were stolen the process of checks and verification governing overseas adoption is necessarily slow because the chances of malpractice are high the adoption process also moves slowly within australia the major factor delaying applications remains the assessment which prospective parents are required to undergo abbotts promise to make adoption much much easier can only work by limiting this assessment intending parents have never welcomed the scrutiny of social workers it suggests that one might not make a good parent and this is more than some people can bear but the best interests of the child demand a full assessment of those seeking to adopt and often some training in the particular skills needed to bring up children with special needs to arbitrarily limit this process cannot benefit the children involved our research has shown that adoption is always a market trading in the commodity of children this is the case notwithstanding the commitment of people advocating adoption to the welfare of children whenever market forces are allowed free reign under the guise of benevolence the risk is that the interests of the silent partner in this interaction the child will be assumed rather than acknowledged and often ignored the history of adoption is a cycle of good intentions uncritically accepted producing sometimes fraught outcomes for those who are adopted at a time when governments across australia have all delivered apologies to victims of past adoption practices it seems unwise to be advocating policies which however well meant run the risk of producing similar damage to people in the future,2013-12,last week tony abbott flanked actor hugh jackman wife adoption advocate deborralee furness

it can take a while for new ideas to catch on in feminism it took the better part of years for betty friedan to stop demonising lesbians as the lavender menace an hilarious epithet that the lesbians in question immediately adopted as their official name more recently its now been over two decades since legal scholar kimberl crenshaw wrote her original paper coining the term intersectionality and mainstream feminism is still in the throes of a massive storm around it intersectionality has been variously described as meaningless too radical and a threat to the sisterhood this level of backlash from those who hold power within feminism is usually a pretty good sign that the target of their ire is something worthwhile crenshaw coined the term as an explanation of why black and immigrant womens experiences ended up being ignored by both feminism and the antiracist movement her original paper contains dozens of stories detailing how domestic violence and rape crisis facilities had serious trouble helping these women because their cases were too complicated those were immigrant women who were too afraid of deportation to use legal redress against their abusive husbands women who spoke a language other than english and werent given access to an interpreter or staff who had no idea how to handle a victim whose cultural background forbid her to acknowledge an abuser within her family for fear of damaging the familys honour these examples reveal an emergent feature of many more institutions than rape crisis centres in the s the problem is not that the individual women who ran these centres were racist but that the entire structure tended to produce outcomes that were much worse for women of colour and thats something we can see playing out over and over within feminism and womens services unless feminism goes hard down the road of recognising and including women from many differing backgrounds the path of least resistance is for it to work mostly on behalf of women who are already relatively privileged if feminism doesnt actively recognise that there are a lot of women whose most pressing concerns arent boardroom representation and lingerie football the movement is going to carry on alienating itself from those most in need of assistance thats not to say lingerie football isnt the purview of feminist analysis because it certainly is and this is not an attack on individual feminists who speak on these issues we have to take a much broader view and ask ourselves why the issues that get the most attention the ones were most keen to talk about and analyse are the ones that mostly affect those of us who look like friedan when intersectionality is derided as inaccessible the type of woman feminism claims to speak on behalf of is made narrower and narrower are we really going to say that an idea nonwhite poor and disabled women have identified as one of their most valuable activist resources a concept the australian human rights commission acknowledges is a crucial tool for change is useless and halfbaked is the australian institute of social relations merely promoting feminist infighting when they release an information pack explaining why intersectionality is crucial within social movements to end violence against women popular feminisms refusal to grasp what is actually a brilliant and elegant concept looks more and more like friedans demonisation of the lavender menace a privileged minority persistently embarrassing itself by refusing to crack a book sometime wandering around with its eyes closed banging off the walls interestingly intersectionality has also been going gangbusters within academic feminism for over a decade widely acknowledged as one of the most important ideas that feminist scholarship has ever come up with the amount of writing and research dedicated to exploring and applying it to produce a more inclusive feminist politics is enormous like the word feminist itself there is disagreement about exactly what it means but thats par for the course in any developing ideology so why is it taking so long for mainstream feminists to follow why are discussions of race class and disability within feminism so often characterised as infighting or sideshows to the main event could it be that for some strange reason marginalised womens experiences with intersectionality and its usefulness are systematically ignored and discredited far from being some bizarre esoteric theory intersectionality is alive and kicking all around us and not just in exclusive ivory tower gender studies clubs call me a conspiracy theorist but there must be some reason pop feminism puts so much effort into repressing a concept that has huge theoretical explanatory power and enormous utility as an organising strategy feminists need to take a long hard look at why so much of our effort is being expended on making up reasons why we cant possibly be expected to help the least privileged women among us so

more than half a million victims of domestic abuse are too terrified to come forward and report their experiences according to provisional estimates of research that specialists hope will quantify the true extent of the crime citizens advice has conducted research over the last year that reveals a higher level of abuse than previously reported a pilot project in nine areas across the uk in which clients were asked a series of routine questions when seeking help with issues such as debt and housing problems found that had experienced domestic abuse at some time since the age of three percentage points more than the national average reported for all women in the latest crime survey for england and wales if extrapolated across the uk the specialists believe that could mean there are up to more victims of domestic abuse the vast majority of whom would have stayed silent according to citizens advice which now plans to roll out the scheme service wide according to those involved in helping domestic violence victims christmas and its attendant financial pressures exacerbate relationship tensions and are a factor in aggravating domestic abuse bridget cheyne who leads on domestic violence for citizens advice in the chorley and south ribble area of lancashire said economic pressures such as not being able to afford the childrens presents or a decent christmas means that that is the busiest time of year for us its bureaux have dealt with reports of domestic violence in the last year a increase from the previous months cheyne said that in her teams latest monthly meeting where agencies discussed the most atrisk cases they had cases compared with during the same period last year the cases are coming in at a rate quicker than i have known she said cheyne added that there were still too many instances of domestic violence that were discovered too late one example she said was the murder of judith maude during the summer maude of hoghton lancashire was stabbed three times in the neck and once in the back by her husband during a savage attack yet there had been no indications or calls to the police that her husband was capable of violence there was no indication that she was in any danger and that sadly can happen if people feel they have nowhere to come forward said cheyne one victim is karen hanna of chorley who was held hostage in her home for more than a week by a partner who raped her and beat her severely hanna who agreed to waive her right to anonymity in order to encourage other victims to come forward said her ordeal began in bristol in with a man she knew though she had no idea he had a history of violence against women she said i was only with him for two weeks when he beat me up and i had him arrested i dropped the charges but he was already under licence for violence so they put him in prison for two years although hanna subsequently moved to lancashire her attackers solicitor provided her new contact details underlining last weeks calls from the labour party for victims of domestic violence to be allowed not to have to disclose their personal information because of the risk they will be attacked again the day after he got out of prison he came straight to my flat and took me hostage he took my phone he took my keys i endured eight days of being held hostage raped battered senseless he ripped out half my hair i had to admit to sleeping with people that i hadnt because of his paranoia if i admitted to doing these things he wouldnt beat me up as much i could only go outside with him and had to pretend everything was ok one night she escaped while he was drunk and asleep i ran out locked him in and called the police who have been fantastic like many victims hanna recognised the difficulties that victims face in coming forward to ask for help its embarrassing humiliating you dont believe that anyone will believe you,2013-12,half million victim domestic abuse terrified come forward report experience according provisional

the hashtag notyourasiansidekick erupted over twitter this week started by freelance writer suey park in support of asian american feminism in one of her tweets she says that she started the movement because she is tired of the patriarchy in asian american spaces and sick of the racism in white feminism i get it after my last time in seoul i decided i would never go back barring deportation or a major crisis when i was there this spring my uncle and i got into a huge fight over our clashing values as an asian man who grew up in postsecond world war south korea he has immensely patriarchal values whereas im an asian american woman who believes anyone supporting womens rights is a feminist the argument erupted when i dared question his decision in front of relatives i had merely pointed out a faster route we could take the issue wasnt that i knew a better alternative but that i had even pointed something out in the first place in front of other people the cherry on top was that i was a woman contradicting a man both of suey parks reasons for starting the movement are real and part of a twofold process patriarchy creates a nonsupportive environment for asian american women at home that makes it even harder for them to overcome the second the discrimination in the public sphere the process for asian american women is especially difficult when they attempt to break into the most public of spaces entertainment as a tv producer and model in los angeles ive been luckier than most people my age in the same world however its still not the easiest thing for young asian americans who choose careers without graduate degrees not only because of parents who are opposed to it but because the road to them is cluttered with stereotyped expectations from all sides there are people in the hollywood crowd who make jokes that are meant to be funny or compliment me the standout was when an acquaintance exclaimed in response to my outbursts asian girls are supposed to be quiet and obedient it was meant to be a goodnatured joke and it wasnt coming from an executive or casting director or anyone who would otherwise give me a job in the industry but these reasons are all beside the point because at the end of the day its the same kind of marginalizing sentiment coming at asian american women from home from social settings and from the workplace its harder than youd think to find an environment that appreciates and rewards women not just asian american women with a smartass boisterous and otherwise unreserved personality the core issue with this sentiment is that its coming from a good place as strange as it sounds people often express it a combination of respect admiration patronization and humor its what causes so much confusion among wellmeaning people who go around with the expectation that asian american women are subservient sex workers and then have the startling realization that many not only fall outside of this stereotype but are offended by it it creates a dissonance where anyone falling outside of this expectation is viewed as a black sheep a deviant as tends to happen when a wellintentioned sentiment is taken in an unintended way at a model casting for a hair salon in la one of the casting agents told me that they already had an exotic look in the book and so they wouldnt be needing anymore i gave him a look and exchanged a beentheredonethat eyebrow rise with another asian american model behind me to which the agent responded with a confused expression then i left that is how many such exchanges go i get frustrated because people in this day and age in a liberal city still dont get why an exotic asian doesnt make sense in mixedrace america its not just an issue that exists in the us though as my experience in seoul showed me the putdown of people who are viewed as different is a constant theme throughout history and throughout cultures and it needs to change for the sake of a healthier society and more enriched world the hashtag campaign opened the gates that could only be opened by the people experiencing this themselves there are already many many important issues in feminism so that the only way to be heard is to elbow in and make room for yourself which is what notyourasiansidekick has started to do its a civil rights movement for asian american women the more that the mainstream sees and hears voices that fall outside the mould the better things will be,2013-12,hashtag notyourasiansidekick erupted twitter week started freelance writer suey park support asian american feminism one

domestic violence victims should not routinely have to disclose their addresses in court because of the risk they will be attacked again labour said on tuesday dan jarvis a shadow justice minister called on the government to bring in eves law proposed changes named after eve thomas a victim of domestic violence who refused to disclose her personal details and was held in contempt of court under the proposals there would be a red flag against the personal information of a victim of domestic abuse highlighting this as confidential and highly sensitive the marker would ensure that the data would never be disclosed unless exceptional circumstances demanded it on tuesday jarvis brought up the case in the house of commons and signalled that labour would try to amend the law unless the government acted to protect domestic violence victims in this way jarvis said it is unacceptable to place victims of domestic violence and abuse at risk by forcing them to disclose their address and contact details in open court this could deter thousands of victims of domestic violence from coming forward and reporting the crimes against them he said its already the case that fewer domestic abuse cases are being referred to the crown prosecution service on this governments watch and experiences like that of eve thomas risk further undermining confidence in our legal system by adopting eves law the government can help address a small legal anomaly which will have a huge effect on the lives of people who have suffered from this horrific crime thomas who was subjected to more than two decades of domestic violence at the hands of her husband has been campaigning to change the law with the help of the human rights lawyer david malone she was the defendant in a small claims case and was asked to provide her personal contact details in open court but refused to do so in case it alerted her husband to her new safe address after he was convicted of battery and put under a restraining order because of her refusal thomas was held in contempt of court and since then she has sought to highlight the legal loophole which could places victims of violence at risk my case is over now but i wanted to ensure that this never happened to another victim again she said this year has been hell for my girls and me and there were times when i wanted to give up because the distress and anxiety was just too much every visit to court came with threats of imprisonment because all i wanted to do was protect my family i fought back once before and i have now done it again and so i will continue this fight and hope that the powers that be will see that it is time that common sense prevailed i want to thank dan jarvis for his support and i pray that our prime minister will see that it is time to initiate change our victims need to feel safe its their right responding in the house of commons damian green the minister for policing criminal justice and victims said he would consider the proposals its not for people at this despatch box to decide what judges do in each in case but obviously there are a range of steps we are already taking to protect victims of domestic violence and we are always happy to look at others,2013-12,domestic violence victim routinely disclose address court risk attacked labour said tuesday dan jarvis shadow justice minister called

the financial security of single parents already hard hit by austerity and welfare reform policies looks likely to deteriorate further over the next two years according to a study by gingerbread the charity for lone parent families the first in a series of studies looking at the impact of the age of austerity finds that many single parents on low to middle incomes are struggling to cope financially with the impact of shrinking incomes and the rising cost of housing food utiility bills and childcare one in five of lone parents said they had lost a month or more since benefit reforms were introduced in april nine out of said they had been forced to cut back on spending on basics such as food and childrens clothes with twothirds skipping meals to ensure their children had enough to eat living frugally was often not enough however and of single parents said they had been forced to borrow over the past year when they had run out of money friends and family were the most common source of loans but half said they had used credit cards or bank overdrafts to pay bills and had used payday lenders nearly twothirds of lone parents in arrears were at least three months behind on one bill as they juggled their outgoings to survive what the report calls a cycle of financial fragility the study found it was hard for lone parents to increase their income because of the weak job market and difficulties finding flexible work to fit around childcare one in five single parents surveyed said their incomes had fallen in the past year as a result of reductions in wages or hours

as several media outlets have already pointed out this has undoubtedly been a huge year for women though we experienced an onslaught of attacks on our basic reproductive and human rights texas youre killing me we should celebrate feminisms various triumphs women everywhere spoke out against rape culture wendy davis kicked some serious ass on the texas senate floor ultraprecocious yearold malala yousafzai gave a speech at the united nations and the solidarity is for white women hashtag on twitter got people all hot and bothered and caused many of us to have important and difficult conversations the list goes on and on im committed to remaining hopeful but as always there is still much work to be done particularly when it comes to the inclusion of women of colour in the larger feminist sphere something that has bothered me since i began studying feminism a problem ill likely continue to gripe about on my death bed of course this issue is nothing new its deeplyrooted and i dont expect us to solve it in my lifetime but it never will be solved if we dont try i forever romantic and borderline nave would like to imagine a world in which all feminists hold each others hands and sing about vulvae im only halfkidding but maybe future generations will be able to pull this off so we should at least help establish a foundation for them obviously feminism is not a homogenous ideology to me the most basic definition is this feminism is the radical notion that women are people thank you gloria naylor beyond that the diversity is endless inevitably we will disagree with one another and ideally healthy discourse makes us all learn grow and become better activists and allies quarrelling about whos feminist enough however is a waste of time and a disservice to us all i propose we all make a pact that we wont brutally attack each other for having differing points of view perhaps it can be our collective new years resolution the recent criticism of michelle obama for instance was incredibly upsetting to me as a woman of colour i feel such meanspirited critiques are manifestations of what is wrong with contemporary feminism it was clear that michelle cottle could not see beyond her privilege to consider that much of what michelle obama does is in fact feminist she slams the first lady for focusing on nutrition and exercise without considering how some of our communities are in dire need of guidance and resources a veggie garden in the middle of a food desert is pretty darn radical if you ask me not only that the author seems to quickly gloss over the fact that women of colour are often stifled by the stereotype of angry blackbrown women while she does acknowledge the issue she doesnt seem to truly care or understand just how paralysing these kinds of stereotypes can be but i digress this is only one example in which white feminists dismiss our realities unfortunately its all too common before a woman attacks another for not being feminist or militant enough i recommend she asks herself the following am i an ally to communities of colour do i care about womens issues that dont directly pertain to me do i care about poverty do i address racism do i try to support and uplift women of different ethnicities and backgrounds is my feminism solely based on my own needs and wants am i concerned about the lgbt community if im a prochoice activist do i also fight against forced sterilisation while i dont want to dictate what feminism is or isnt i do believe that regardless of what one believes feminism is we should care about all women mainstream outlets also continue to think our stories are not lucrative or newsworthy all this talk about the booming latino market for example is in no way reflected in major news websites personally ive felt there in many instances that a publication wanted my work to fulfil some latinoa quota even if my article did really well that would be the last id ever hear from them this publication is an exception i should note in my head i imagined the editors patting themselves on the back for publishing an article written by a brown woman and then going right back to news that consistently leaves us out this makes me feel a like a token b like a chump and c incredibly sad i know many other women whove had similar frustrations feminists of colour need a platform we need to be part of the conversation i think i can speak for many of my fellow latina feminists when i say breaking through and being heard often feels impossible while we dont all come together for a weekly meeting i do commiserate with several on a weekly basis its absolutely exhausting to kick down so many doors why not just let us in and speak for ourselves why is it that mastheads continue to be so white while our country is becoming more and more diverse as the journalist cindy george once said if you dont cover black or brown people your coverage is dishonest our stories matter and our concerns desperately need to be heard publications need to consistently publish and hire diverse voices they should do it because its the right thing to do not simply when its trendy or because twitter says so

over the years beyonc has been soundly criticized for not being feminist enough there are a number of pieces decrying her attire and her concert tour titles there are even open letters from blue ivy and michelle obama making it clear that good parents dont let their kids adore beyonc yet beyonc seemingly has it all a career family and a lifestyle that many envy and many more hope to emulate she employs more women than any other artist in the industry and she owns her sexuality in ways that many sexpositive feminists celebrate in other women so what exactly is she doing that isnt feminist is it the fact that she sings largely about relationships is it her willingness to embrace her sexuality and use it as part of her career or is it the fact that she revels in the happiness she has found in marriage and motherhood what exactly is beyonc supposed to do that will appease everyone yet still allow free will her new album might as well be titled having it all the beyonce way in flawless a track that leaked as bow down over the summer beyonc quotes from author chimamanda ngozi adichies tedx talk we should all be feminists adroitly addressing the idea that she is somehow antifeminist for not fitting into the boxes others project onto her its clear that like a lot of black american women the mainstream middle class white feminist narratives with which we are so familiar arent necessarily compatible with beyoncs view of herself this album makes it clear that her feminism isnt academic isnt about waves or labels it simply is a part of her as much as anything else in her life shes prowoman without being antiman and she wants the world to know that you can be feminist on a personal level without sacrificing emotions friendships or fun is it a message that will appeal to everyone no but then no one expects any other feminist message to be unilaterally accepted do they theres a reason the narrative that appeals to beyonc and so many others is one that draws attention to the reality that being a feminist is more than toeing some imaginary line to please others it is working inside and outside your community to achieve your goals and still being able to connect with the people you love in ways that are good for all of you beyonc is a hardworking career woman a happily married spouse to a powerful partner and a loving mother in a climate that tells her that she can be one of those things maybe two but certainly not all three yet she is doing all of those things and so her focus is on navigating the mundane aspects of life as a complete complex person in a movement that touts the idea of choice you dont have to agree with someones choices to respect them or their right to make them feminism has never been one size fits all yet much of the criticism that revolves around entertainers like beyonc or corporate leaders like sheryl sandberg presumes that there is a unilateral guide on how to be the right kind of feminist as we talk about rebranding feminism about solidarity in feminist circles even about what issues are feminist we must remember that the movement seeks to represent people and it must recognize that individuals will have different needs wants and routes to achieving their goals beyoncs critique of mainstream feminism may be musical but it is still incisive valid and incredibly cogent right now its a lyrical explanation of whats wrong with assuming that being feminist requires one to follow a script and not your own heart it appeals deeply to the kind of people that express discomfort with the label of feminist while leading lives that are exactly what feminism proclaims women should be able to enjoy if a ceos guide to career success can be feminist then so can an album a tour or the daily life of someone whos achievements will only matter to their family if mileys owning her sexuality via appropriation of black womens bodies is feminist then what is beyoncs ownership of her own image when we decide that a womans personal life however public is subject to censure because her choices are not our choices how feminist are we when we decide that race class or life experiences shouldnt matter as much as outside opinions what message are we sending feminism is meant to be inclusive that means not just paying lip service to intersectional analysis but also embracing the reality that feminist choices vary based on those factors that we dont all share,2013-12,year beyonc ha soundly criticized feminist enough number piece decrying attire concert tour title even open letter blue ivy michelle

the politician who called a blonde colleague an abortion barbie for campaigning for a womans right to choose the magazine editor who described women in his pages as ornamental and the the commentator

from the representation project the us team whose minute awardwinning film miss representation highlighted in the ways women and girls are objectified in the media some of the examples from their current work bad like robin thickes blurred lines video or good like the goldieblox ads have already been shared and debated in the uk others carl jr burgers not so much but how many examples of sexism in politics and the media could be gathered just from the uk just thinking back over the past hours theres thursdays daily mail front page coverage of the danish prime minister described as a

screaming children soiled nappies inquisitive minds our early childhood workforce work incredibly hard these are the people who care for over one million of our children each and every day they comfort nurture and educate during the period when of childrens brain development takes place and they do it for a pittance few could argue that these vital workers should remain amongst the lowest paid of the australian workforce yet this week just before christmas thousands of them have had a long overdue pay rise cruelly ripped off them people are right to be mightily peeved about this this is a display of the governments chaotic decision making their disregard for the promises they have made and for the workers who are affected by way of background child care centres generally pay their staff in one of two ways either at the award rate painfully inadequate or at a rate negotiated through an enterprise agreement still seriously inadequate workers are paid at varying rates but they all share salaries so low that they are forced to make the impossible choice between caring for other peoples children or being able to suitably provide for their own it is a common complaint from educators i love this job i do it for the children but i simply cant afford to continue all reasonable people would agree that this needs to be fixed the solution is for an across the board increase to their award lifting all salaries ensuring that no one gets left behind for this to occur the previous labor government created the fair work commission which enabled cases like this to be heard and established a pay equity unit to provide the support to help the case succeed but it doesnt happen overnight like the social and community services sector case which ultimately saw over bn in increased wages flow to a low paid and feminised workforce hours or research support argument and hearings need to occur first it is a process that is underway though and one which if supported by the abbott government will hopefully bring a successful result and a long term solution in the meantime however many of our educators just cannot hold on we are losing staff at a rapid rate and parents are left dropping their children off in the hands of carers who all too often wont be the same ones the following week when in government labor decided to urgently act on this and show the sector that we recognised their plight and would assist whilst the case was being heard we established a two year m early years quality fund eyqf to ensure that more workers could move from the award rate to a higher salary on an enterprise agreement relief was at hand and when tony abbott pledged before the election that if elected the coalition will honour funds contracted from the eyqf it really looked like these underpaid undervalued staff would finally see a pay rise this is where the story takes a turn into bizarre land what happened next was farcical just weeks after the election the government changed its mind and declared that the payments were now up for review uncertainty returned once more staff across our child care centres questioned if they should stick with it whether they were really appreciated and would actually ever receive adequate pay but wait another flip flop and change of direction when asked about these contracts just last week abbott assured all we will absolutely honour all of our commitments and contracts and contracts which have been entered into will be honoured finally hard working professionals were edging closer to their additional three dollars an hour just before christmas but alas it was not to be the twists and turns and weasel words continued in one of the most seriously peculiar and desperately cruel government announcements yet this week we learned it was all off the government would honour these contracts assistant minister ley informed us but then theyd ask the sector to do the right thing and give the money straight back so it can be spent on training im not going to try and work out how a government can say that a program is so bad that it cant continue so aboveboard that theyll honour contracts and so misguided that theyll ask for the money back and hold all of these possible at the same time but what i do know is who will suffer as a result too scared to break yet another election commitment theyve asked child care providers to break it for them early childhood educators have once more been let down and ripped off the announcement is a mean betrayal which leaves our early childhood educators out of pocket the government justifies its position by stating that the fair work commission is the only body that should determine child care wages if they do not now sign up and support the wage claim before the commission this will be shown to be just more empty words creating more false hope for a group of hard working australians who deserve much much better,2013-12,screaming child soiled nappy inquisitive

working mothers are wrongly seen as scatty and clockwatching by employers who fail to understand that they have already done a days work before they leave home the shadow childcare minister lucy powell will say today as the treasury moved to offer reassurances that maternity and paternity pay would be protected in future after david cameron confirmed they would be included in a proposed welfare cap powell will call for a revolution to overcome prejudices faced by working parents in her first speech since her appointment to the frontbench role powell will say working mothers are still depicted in the same way as the character played by wendy craig in the s sitcom butterfiles powell who recently returned to westminster from maternity leave will say too often working parents are given a bad name at work seen as not focused on the job or having to leave early or take time off i want to bust this myth i want to champion working parents particularly working mums and i want business and other organisations to join me far from being scatty and clockwatching working mums have done a days work before they leave the house we dont waste a minute of our day we are highly productive at work because we have to be we are loyal and creative employees we should be celebrating not berating the role parents play in the workforce and in society powell will criticise david cameron for appointing just one mother the culture secretary maria miller to the cabinet she will say this is a job for all of us it is shocking that there is only one mum in david camerons cabinet and the depiction of working mums on the tv hasnt moved on much from wendy craigs character ria in butterflies thats why we need more working mums in positions of power and culturally to reflect the positive contribution we make in her speech powell will highlight labours plans to extend free childcare for three and four year olds with working parents from to hours such policies are designed to help working mothers who face an an impenetrable glass ceiling she will say my generation of women expected that we could have it all but we are all too often still having to choose between career and motherhood and being plagued by guilt whichever path we take there remains an impenetrable glass ceiling for working mums i want my daughters generation to be able to have the best of both worlds and to have real choice so my main message to you today is that in order for this to be realised we need an ambitious agenda for childcare and family policy powells speech comes after the treasury tried to offer assurances that maternity and paternity pay would be safe when they are included in a welfare cap to be introduced next year the torytreasury twitter account run by close aides of the chancellor tweeted that the welfare cap was designed to target the housing benefit budget which accounts for just over of the bn welfare spending that is to be subject to a cap from next year maternity and paternity pay which is due to cost about bn a year within the next four years accounts for of the amount included in the welfare cap the treasury says that it is important to include maternity and paternity pay in the cap to ensure that if a baby boom is predicted prompting a rise in the cost of benefit then cuts can be made elsewhere in the welfare budget to protect the benefit for young parents torytreasury tweeted if there is an unforecast baby boom the government should have to find the cost elsewhere or win a vote on increasing the cap it also tweeted it would be up to government of the day what to cut fast growing benefits like hb much better candidates osbornes office clarified the governments thinking after the prime minister was asked by the labour mp fiona odonnell to clarify whether maternity and paternity pay would be included in the cap cameron told mps as the chancellor announced at the time what is out of the benefit cap is the basic state pension i think that is important on all other welfare spending we need to ensure that we are distributing properly the different sorts of welfare the chancellor announced in his autumn statement last week that from next year a cap would be imposed on welfare spending although jobseekers allowance and the state pension will be exempted the state pension is underpinned by a triple lock that says it will

i cant imagine whod want to be a nun these days small wonder they go around in disguise most orders have ditched the habit and in france entire convents are garbed in jeans the benign wimple wearers of the bbcs call the midwife returning to our screens this christmas are the exception the rule is that whether in fictional renderings or the latest news about the ongoing reparations for irelands magdalene laundries nuns are portrayed as hateful and heartless shrews this is the case in the film philomena about one womans search for the son she was forced to give up for adoption by nuns in the s there are sisters who say they are nervous they might be spat at in the street and some critics have warned that devout catholics should not go to mary omalleys hilarious play once a catholic now on at kilburns tricycle theatre because the nuns portrayed are such horrors it is true some nuns have been oppressive and narrowminded but there is also a case for including religious sisters in the canon of feminism certainly when it comes to the education of girls it was germaine greer who pointed out that if irish nuns hadnt tramped across the broiling australian desert in the th century young women in australia would have had virtually no education and thats something ive noticed among many women of my own generation even where they rebelled against the strictures of the catholic church or dropped the faith altogether they have continued to value the nuns who schooled them and encouraged their ambition mary robinson irelands first female president so admired the sacred heart nuns who taught her in dublin that she seriously considered becoming one herself dear maeve binchy lost her faith as a young woman yet until the end of her life spoke with gratitude of the nuns who educated her at the holy child convent and visited them often as an adult the late novelist and philanthropist josephine hart said the st louis nuns opened her eyes to literature and poetry similarly nuala ofaolain who was an oxford don at the age of and had contempt for priests felt a debt of gratitude to the st louis nuns indeed when i think of the irish feminist movement with which i was involved in the s almost all of those women had been prompted in their spirit of independence by particular nuns sister benvenuta also known as historian and scholar margaret maccurtain remains a stalwart of irish feminism it is a staple of feminism that young girls in the past grew up with few choices or expectations marriage or the stigma of lifelong spinsterhood were seen as the main options but at my convent school marriage was seldom mentioned these teachers were consecrated virgins why would they exhort us to marriage the role the nuns held before us wasnt wedlock but pioneering sainthood such as st catherine of siena who drank a cupful of lepers pus to show she wasnt afraid or st angela de merici who travelled all over italy on horseback in the early th century tutoring girls fortitude and backbone were upheld as womanly virtues rather than the pursuit of frivolities certainly there were women unsuited to convent life and perhaps especially unsuited to the care of young single mothers unconscious sexual jealousy must enter into the equation between a consecrated virgin and a pregnant teenager it is also probable that nuns had a class bias the convents that educated young ladies were highminded and cultured whereas the sisters who dealt with the lower orders often slapped the kids into submission yet i am sorry for nuns when i see them being relentlessly portrayed as the gestapo in wimples as dave allen once halfjoked i still have before me the image of poor mother peter claver a medieval scholar unsuited to teaching who was driven to a nervous collapse at the st trinianslike conduct of our fourth form nuns no doubt can be cruel but children can be cruel too and i think the lesson i took from my own convent education was the immense variability of the human

a universal statefunded childcare service delivered through childrens centres is set to be one of the themes of a major report into the condition of britain to be published this week by centreleft thinktank the ippr such a move would be seen as a way of cementing labours commitment to the family the study is being closely followed by jon cruddas the head of the labour policy review and one of the staunchest advocates of the lefts duty to the family as the bedrock of society the report will assert britain is not broken as david cameron once claimed but warns family life and structures are under a new pressure from economic turmoil fragile social bonds and a state that hasnt caught up with its changing needs cruddas is also sympathetic to the ippr emphasis on a decentralised state a theme that is likely to emerge in an industrial review for labour being conducted by lord adonis the ippr report which will argue prioritising universal childcare rather than expanding tax credits and benefits would represent labours shift to the family this commitment would be advanced through community institutions such as childrens centres that bring children and parents together rather than resting on redistributing income through individual cash benefits or vouchers such cash transfers do not get to the root of family problems the report will argue the interim ippr report due on thursday is designed to give a portrait of britain under stress the thinktank hopes the report will come to be seen to be as important to the lefts thinking as the ipprs social justice commission in a report that shaped many of tony blairs public service reforms in seeking out the concerns of the british people over the past six months the ippr says all messages inevitably came back to the family including fears about whether children will any longer fare better than parents and whether social care for the oldest generation is adequate the left the ippr report will admit has sometimes shied away from the family for fear of being judgmental or exclusive the report will say it is clear that families do not feel that politics is speaking to their concerns or meeting their needs although a commitment to universal childcare would be expensive in an era of tight public finances the ippr is set to argue communitybased universal childcare is more efficient than other ways of delivering childcare and acts to mobilise the energies and resources in civil society it will argue that tax relief for childcare rightly asserts the importance of supporting parents to work but rests on a market mechanism that risks pushing up prices while neglecting the importance of institutions that bring people together equally a marriage tax break might recognise the importance of supporting relationships but both reduce this to a monetary transaction and neglects the diversity of modern families and different forms of commitment by contrast affordable childcare the ippr report argues would ease the pressures of time and money faced by families across the income spectrum all over the country the market is incapable of meeting this need while the state has not caught up with the dynamics of modern family life it will point out currently childcare is expensive and childrens centres are retreating a parttime nursery place now osts over a week having risen by over the last decade as many as childrens centres are thought to have closed or merged since long working hours are also squeezing family time nearly half of fathers work more than hours or more a week higher than in most other european countries a third of parents say they wish they could spend more time with their children elderly relatives often face isolation as families stretch one million older people regularly feel lonely including one in five of those in their s and s but the report rejects suggestions that society is broken pointing to falling crime and antisocial behaviour since the mids the number of young people committing offences has more than halved since peaking in the mids there have also been big falls in reports of vandalism and graffiti and of teenagers hanging around on the street despite the scale of the recession unemployment has not hit the levels seen in the s and early s the report also says two thirds of adults believe that people in their neighbourhood pull together to improve the local area and half of adults say they do some form of voluntary or community work at least once a month but it says that society is also facing deep pressures mainly due to longterm economic changes there has also been overconfidence in the capacity of market mechanisms to meet public needs whether in relation to childcare social care housing or affordable credit and a naivety about the power of capital to dominate and squeeze out what matters in life like time or relationships,2013-12,universal statefunded childcare service delivered childrens centre set one theme

what are the actions that will propel a woman to use clares law to ask the police to disclose their partners history of domestic violence what should it take a dodgy look a black eye a feeling and then what happens next clares law named after yearold clare wood will be rolled out nationwide from march to help protect vulnerable women from domestic violence in after a year in which hed threatened her with rape and been arrested for breaking down her front door george appleton strangled wood then set her body on fire appleton had a history of abuse woods family said a law like this could have saved her life except except there are questions as christmas approaches with its alcohol darkness and difficult chats so do more incidents of violence and sometimes it cracks its the forced familyness the thing many of us me included look forward to at this time of year the imposed fun the microwave of a house bubbling with unresolved history a history that can contribute to a feeling of being trapped that can contribute to the manipulation the violence its at this time of year that women in abusive relationships are trying harder than ever which is why i wonder how helpful it is for clares law to suggest it is the responsibility of the victim to make that call to save their own lives already the question why doesnt she just leave him is one that those discussing violence against women must sighingly explain again and again the reasons veer between emotional and practical kerbs the victim might feel ashamed she might hope things will change she might be isolated cut off financially she might think its important to keep her children at the home they grew up in she might still love him but say she calls say she takes her phone into the office loos and quietly asks the police if her boyfriend has ever been arrested for beating an ex and they tell her one of two things they tell her he has a record of violence or they tell her he hasnt by which they mean they have no reports of abuse this bearing in mind that only of victims report incidents of domestic violence to the police so what happens next if shes called presumably something is not quite right are the structures in place to give her the help she needs to leave in the uk two women are killed a week as a result of domestic violence often as happened with clare wood after failure on the part of the police theyre most at risk just after leaving and then where can they go a womens aid survey showed that on a single day last june women and their children were turned away from refuges in britain due to lack of space these homes are being wiped out funding for womens services has been cut by in the past two years which means even if a woman summons the courage to call then to leave there may be nowhere for her to go this is the thing clare woods problem wasnt that she didnt know appleton had a history of violence it was that the police did not respond the difficulty is not as clares law suggests in working out the risks of an abusive relationship the difficulty and where help is urgently required is in leaving the relationship behind if were serious about ending violence against women we need to stand further back rather than concentrate on the tools available to women or men when theyre suspicious we should be investing in their future safety and their futures to prevent more violent relationships we should be educating the young people who in bedfordshire universitys recent research said they believed sexual violence was normal and inevitable and that women should face the blame for their own abuse here are the places in which small tortures start the people who really need clares law might not even know it rather than a phone line we need exit routes

christ child dont get me wrong i am awed by the doctrine of the incarnation but to be honest i get much more excited about easter the resurrection and the idea of a god that can redeem even death rather what i love about the current season is the spotlight however brief it shines on a poor courageous young girl named mary maybe its because i love any excuse to give a platform to any woman typically regulated to the margins of sociopolitical ethnocultural and religious narratives we gloss over the significance that for at least a few chapters of the traditional judeochristian narrative mary a secondclass citizen as a woman in her historical period is given a voice and her voice is one that not only converses with the divine but sings of gods remembrance and provision for the marginalized whether we choose to admit it or not the reality is that women are still marginalized in religious traditions centuries later women of the abrahamic faiths are still working not only to speak aloud but to have their voices heard and recognized as valuable and necessary i wonder what it would look like if women across faith traditions began talking together about this shared challenge in my own recent personal experience a young woman walked up to me while i was greeting folks during the church coffee hour after a discussion in paris about women of faith telling their difficult stories i stared for a second too long at the dichotomy she a muslim woman in her s wearing a turquoise colored hijab holding my book titled talking taboo american christian women get frank about faith i asked her name and signed the book then i asked if she was a member of this church i knew the answer but didnt want to make any assumptions i am too familiar with being on the receiving end of rash judgments no im just visiting im muslim she said pointing to her hijab of course i replied are you from paris i just got here a month ago im getting my masters she said thats great where were you before paris i had too many questions but had to start light yemen im from yemen as we talk i am continually caught off guard by how beautiful she is her small face is perfectly framed by the hijab and i find myself admiring her brown eyes and her perfect eyeliner ive been trying for months to get that cat eye she created so i have to ask you as a muslim woman why are you interested in this book she laughs at me and replies well im muslim but a lady is a lady right im curious if i will find overlaps with what we muslim women find hard to talk about in our own faith tradition the more we talked the more we realized how much we had in common in our active and attentive work on locating and securing our voices amidst a cacophony of competing cultural and religious narratives she asked me what it was like as a black christian woman living in america if i found it difficult to speak about certain things i fumbled for an answer caught off guard by the insightfulness of her question where could i begin to tell her of the multiple worlds i had learned to maneuver as black as christian as woman its definitely interesting im actually nigerianamerican i was born in america but raised in a few other countries she looked at me waiting for more of an answer i didnt really get what it meant to be black until i went back to live in america for college and i guess its taken me years to negotiate identity within a place like america you know where there is such painful racial history and continual tensions she said thoughtfully isnt it something how people make all sorts of judgments based on what you look like yes yes without even knowing your story i was thrilled because i knew on some level in her own way she got it the big and small ways we find ourselves marginalized by both individuals and cultural traditions that want us to believe we are the sum of our physical appearances i had to ask her widad if you could write your own essay about a taboo topic what would you want to write about she looked pensively at the ceiling and said i would want to write about how much i hate people asking me about my hijab you have no idea how much people judge me based on this thing alone you know they ask me what im trying to prove by wearing this those who know islamic traditions ask me if i really am a virgin to be wearing it some people even just ignore me or make comments about terrorists so you will probably get mad at me for askingbut what does the hijab mean to you her entire demeanor shifts and when she answers it truly its as though she is speaking of a loved one she points to it this means everything to me it reminds me of how i want to live my life in preparation for the afterlife it reminds me of my values you know i always think back to my mother talking to me and my sisters about hijab you know she says if you have two pieces of chocolate on the table and one piece has a bite taken from it and the other piece is whole and wrapped which one would you want to take of course my sisters and me we say we want the wrapped one my mother she says that piece of wrapped chocolate that is what a woman with hijab is like as i listened to widad i couldnt help but wonder if this conversation could have happened in the us i could not think of ever encountering a muslim woman visiting any christian churches i had ever stepped into in america i could not imagine how she might have been received the stares the comments the silences even but here we were both countries away from our homes talking candidly and almost giddy about being women of faith trying to live and speak in ways that honored our spirits our minds and our bodies later i think of how i struggle sometimes with being a identified as a christian with being part of a religious history that has kept women invisible that has enslaved black people that has preached prosperity in the face of global poverty but then i think also about being bound and claimed by a narrative in which the god of abraham isaac and jacob graciously makes room for all at the proverbial table the god i have come to know through the biblical scriptures was always inviting those that others wanted to cast to the margins women the poor ethnic and religious minorities of which christ was a part i think back to the hebrew story of hagar the egyptian woman cast out from sarai and abrams home she and her illegitimate son ishmael are left to die in the wilderness but god will not let that happen god sees her saves her and promises that her son will birth his own nation ishmael becomes the father of the ishmaelites of which the religious tradition of islam is derived i think of how as a muslim widad could trace her faith back to this story of god seeing hagar a woman at the margins i think of how i can trace my faith back to the story of god also seeing another woman at the margins mary the poor teenage mother of jesus i see us now widad and me wondering aloud about the things our faith traditions try to keep us from saying and i imagine god saying to widad to me no you too must be heard maybe it is the season after all,2013-12,season nearly third global population preparing celebrate birth jesus christian love time year necessarily focus christ child dont get wrong awed doctrine incarnation honest get much excited easter resurrection idea god redeem even death rather love current season spotlight however brief shine poor courageous young girl named mary maybe love excuse give platform woman typically regulated margin sociopolitical ethnocultural religious

it was our wedding day we had made promises to each other raised glasses cut a cake and waved goodbye to assembled guests we were on our way to what we had never sat down and talked about it about what it would be like who would do what and what the priorities would be we were good together we would go on being good together no need to spoil it all with plans and job descriptions as if it was a business fifty years ago it was just assumed that my career would have priority would determine where and how we would live elizabeth would have the main responsibility for the home and for the children if they came whatever interests and talents she developed would have to be fitted into her domestic priorities i assumed that she thought so too i dont remember asking her looking back it was incredibly selfish of me particularly as my career took me into ever more absorbing areas from business to academia to the church what added to the problem was that each job came with less not more remuneration than the last that left elizabeth to fill the financial gap which she always and valiantly did running her own interior design business and later leasing and letting out a succession of small apartments all while still managing the home i never gave her any money to buy food or household necessities she took care of all those out of her earnings leaving me to look after the regular outgoings the mortgage utilities repairs that was unusual my father had given my mother a regular monthly allowance which she was expected to account for i remember her agonising over her accounts trying to remember what she had spent on what in that respect we had moved on or society had i was not the boss in the home i am ashamed now at how little i contributed to the domestic scene leaving early in the morning in our only car returning after the children had gone to bed letting my wife take the children to school on her bicycle to do all the shopping and housework and still find time for her work but that was the pattern of marriage among our friends and colleagues why did we not discuss it more formally like almost everyone else we made it up as we went along as we did so we began to realise that we each had different notions because we had never spelled these out unspoken resentments smouldered and occasionally flared up every relationship is based around an implicit contract a balance of expectations unless these are spelled out misunderstandings are inevitable moreover the contracts need to be fair to each party many years earlier in the course of my business career i had to negotiate a contract with a chinese agent in malaysia we agreed the terms shook hands and shared the traditional glass of brandy i then took out the official company contract for him to sign he was indignant what is that for he said angrily dont you trust me the contract will only work if both of us get what we want out if it a signature should be unnecessary in fact it makes me suspect that you think you have got a better deal than me and want to lock me in to it i persuaded him that it was only a company formality but i took his point i have never forgotten it if both parties dont feel the deal is fair it wont stick in business or in relationships we would have avoided much unhappiness had i remembered my chinese contract and made a series of deals as we went through life deals that gave both of us enough of what we wanted that chinese contract was also time limited it had to be renegotiated in due course so it is with implicit marriage contracts circumstances change jobs change kids grow up people die or fall ill when i was i ran out of jobs there were none i wanted that might want me too early and too poor to retire i became a selfemployed writer and lecturer the freedom was exciting but the income precarious and i found it embarrassing to ask for it my wife came to the rescue she became my agent and business manager and was very good at it so good in fact that i got busier and richer until the day when she in effect gave in her notice her life she said had become submerged in mine she had recently graduated with a degree in photography after five years of parttime study and now wanted to fulfil her dream of becoming a professional portrait photographer my life was now in her way this time we did sit down to a proper contract negotiation we agreed to split the year in two for the six summer months her work would have priority in our diary i would concentrate on research and writing and take on no outside commitments the winter months would be free for my speaking engagements with her help in organising them furthermore we decided to split the cooking and catering with each doing half she in our london apartment i in the country cottage we were fortunate in that we were both independent workers the children had left home and we were free to organise our lives as we saw fit not everyone has that degree of freedom but most couples do need to rearrange their relationship in midlife as circumstances change too often one party makes a unilateral decision to change the contract without discussion even in some situations to look for another partner altogether we were lucky we were able to help each other and to share our work and that brought us together in a new relationship that contract lasted for more than years they were fruitful and enjoyable times then circumstances changed again i was approaching i did not need to earn as much as in the past i had a pension of sorts at the same time our children belatedly began to produce grandchildren i had not realised how rewarding but also how timeconsuming these little people can be paid work no longer dominated our two lives but retiring was not how it felt we were busier than ever but differently a new contract was needed as we no longer needed so much moneymaking work we could afford to do more voluntary work in addition to the continuing rota of lectures and articles we began to combine our skills and interests making photo documentaries for voluntary organisations no longer did we split the year in two because we now worked together even when the grandchildren came to stay instead we crossed out in the diary all the days of school halfterms and holidays so that we could be available to help with the grandchildren living now on a fixed and probably declining income we also needed to simplify our way of life downsizing and discarding instead of accumulating so much that we had once done now seemed unnecessary even pointless life moves on and leaves a lot behind people turn philosopher as they age wondering what the purpose of it all is whether it was all wasted effort what is still left to do energy may be declining but you hope that wisdom or rueful experience has increased these last years are precious and we needed to make the most of them the new contract needed careful thought i have long seen the shamrock as an important symbol its three leaves combining to make a whole i have used it in a variety of contexts but now i wanted to use it to describe how it might define our purposes at this stage in our lives the three leaves would be body mind and spirit together they would make for a fulfilling life the whole shamrock with money providing the stalk the essential support that we would be stupid to ignore the body is crucial when the body crumbles everything stops or changes we resolved to eat less and exercise more easier to say than to keep to but we try to have regular checkups was another resolution troubles spotted early are more easily dealt with body and mind interact an active mind both needs and makes a healthy body work keeps one fit a recent study by the institute of economic affairs found that those who described themselves as fully retired doing no active work were less likely to describe themselves as having very good health compared with those still working more worrying the chance of a diagnosed medical condition rose by if you were not working and depression by work exercises the mind work also provides us with a social network that is important to the spirit the chinese have a saying that happiness is having something to work on someone to love and something to hope for these three ingredients are to us what makes life worth living it gives us a purpose a purpose that for us is increasingly focused on the next generation and our hopes for them and their descendants both in our family and wider life without others seems meaningless so we have resolved to give as much time as we can to seeing old friends and family loneliness is the new poverty of the developed world we are determined that we shall not suffer from it but we have to invest in others if we are going to matter to them of course we are the fortunate members of a fortunate generation many will envy the apparent ease of our lives although it did not seem easy at the time not everyone will have the freedom to make the choices we did but whatever our circumstances we all have choices if we are lucky enough to be in a relationship those choices have to take account of the other person and they need constant revision as our lives change otherwise they wont work we learned that the long way often the hard way but it was worth it i sometimes say half seriously when others are talking of their second or third marriages that i too am on my third marriage but in my case they have all been to the same woman and that has made all the difference reflections on ageing the

the victim of an alleged rape tried to kill herself when a detective failed to investigate her complaint and lied about the outcome of the case a court has heard dc hannah notley of essex police was jailed for four months on friday after admitting she had not investigated the allegation properly and had falsely told the victim and senior police officers that prosecutors had found there was no case to answer notley had told the alleged victim and her superiors that the crown prosecution service had decided not to pursue the case when in reality she had never passed the file to them as notley was sentenced at southwark crown court prosecutors revealed that the victim of the alleged rape had tried to kill herself the alleged victim stated that on the evening she was telephoned by notley to say there was no further action she tried to take her own life said zoe martin prosecuting notley from benfleet essex who was a sexualoffencestrained detective at essex cid admitted misconduct in public office between july and april martin told the court that after notley was assigned to the case a suspect was arrested and interviewed and his mobile phone and computer examined but when notley was later asked what had happened in the case she told a superior the cps had decided not to pursue it when it was logged on the police system as having no further action notley failed to put superiors straight and even told the alleged victim that cps lawyers had decided to drop the case despite knowing it had never been passed to them martin said she falsely informed her superiors and the victim of the case that the cps had advised that no further action be taken against the suspect when in fact no file had been sent to the cps no such advice had been received in reality ms notley had not submitted the file to the cps and no lawyer had been allocated to the case and clearly it follows that no decision had been made by the cps in february last year notley spoke to the complainant telling her the cps had dropped the case because she had reported it too late so there was no physical evidence she the complainant was clearly upset because it implied that the nfa no further action decision to some extent was her fault for reporting the rape late in the day martin said an independent adviser allocated to the complainant pursued the matter and it transpired that the cps had never been sent the file notley originally told the adviser she would chase prosecutors but when she realised the truth was coming out in april last year she contacted her professional standards department and confessed the independent police complaints commission ipcc said it had uncovered issues with the supervision of notley as a trainee detective within the essex force the ipcc also found a case to answer for misconduct in a second investigation by notley into an allegation of sexual touching reported in may key actions were left incomplete and decisions were not recorded and documented correctly this meant there was no accurate description of why the case was closed on the forces crime recording system,2013-12,victim alleged rape tried kill detective failed

melissa kite asks why women still find life in the commons so unbearable telling us to toughen up man up women mps november if thats her view she should wise up kite talks of a growing exodus of recently elected women rising stars forced out tragically early by the macho posturing in parliament the subtext is that if we cant stand the heat get back to the kitchen but as a guardian leader column helpfully pointed out the number of women mps standing down is not disproportionate compared with men unfortunately kite shares the media obsession with a few among the intake of women mps many of them tories theyre still new to parliament some to politics generally in any job it takes time to find your feet and become fully effective louise mensch gave the impression that the tragedy of her resignation was how politics had failed her not how she might have failed politics says kite while its true that mensch didnt seem to get the idea of a fiveyear contract with voters many others are taking to the job well kite refers to shrinking violets and says among the intake complaining of sexism none i can think of is worthy of that most auspicious term battleaxe she cites mps such as ann widdecombe barbara castle and margaret thatcher but look at the women mps who head ministerial and shadow ministerial teams who regularly ask ministers questions who challenge the pm at prime ministers questions and who lead debates some of our best select committee chairs are women margaret hodge and louise ellman follow in the footsteps of the late gwyneth dunwoody natascha engel chairs the increasingly important backbench business committee allocating debates on issues backbenchers want to discuss for the first time there are two women deputy speakers dawn primarolo and eleanor laing women mps the majority of whom represent labour are diverse talented and outspoken some came through labour selection procedures designed to break the logjam of discrimination that saw female mps stuck in low numbers for decades most of labours women mps represent gritty urban seats requiring resilience to get selected let alone elected kite says that todays female politicians dont seem to know how to handle male politicians but these mps work diligently in their constituencies and at westminster often getting little recognition for their efforts even if they achieve more than many male mps the majority of new mps in were women such as sharon hodgson barbara keeley lyn brown helen goodman and roberta blackmanwoods with the hugely varied life experiences wanted by the public they are campaigning parliamentarians who speak out for their constituents focusing on women who have only been in parliament for three years provides an incomplete picture parliament needs major reform having more women at westminster making the case for change will help it happen in the meantime i would ask kite and the media in general to observe the work of female mps from all intakes and parties including those who didnt go to oxbridge dont live in certain north london postcodes and who represent seats outside the southeast were just getting on with the job diana johnson is labour mp for hull

no such thing as a free lunch the principle has been sorely tested by the revelation of a yawning shortfall in the budget for nick cleggs overhaul of free school meals the political cost of cleggs pet project was already high when the lib dems announced their pledge to supply a free hot lunch to all state primary schoolchildren aged five to seven at their party conference in september it was widely seen as a coalition tradeoff against the conservatives pet project of tax breaks for married couples the actual costs it turns out had not been accurately counted the fact that feeding an extra million children entails upgrading school kitchens to the tune of m appears to have come as a foreheadsmacking surprise an extra m has apparently been found down the back of the coalition sofa the remaining m according to clegg will be funded by an underspend in the department of educations schools maintenance budget the gove camp at the dfe insists there is no spare money for cleggs kitchens oops universal free school meals are an excellent idea pilot schemes in the uk and tested policies in other countries have shown that the provision of a hot lunch for all significantly improves the educational chances of poorer children michael gove may prefer to reserve dfe funds for the promotion of academic rigour and the money pit which is free schools but hungry children cannot snack on pencil shavings the problem however with cleggs meal deal is that it is not in fact universal it is offered only to children in their first three years of schooling he hopes eventually to roll it out across all year groups but given the coalitions zeal for benefittrimming i dont fancy his chances it is a halfmeasure backed by half a government mired in political expediency and personal grandstanding cleggs pledge is undoubtedly a votecatcher encapsulating the lib dem position on social policy it helps the poor but throws in a sweetener approximately a year per child for the more affluent in light of restricted and it now seems uncertain funding id rather feed poorer children for longer than subsidise all families for a limited period clearly there is a longstanding problem with the targeting and administration of free school meals as it stands four out of children in poverty do not receive the subsidy either because they are ineligible not quite poor enough to meet current criteria or because they do not take up the benefit underregistration is a problem not just for families in need but for schools who use free school meals as the metric for calculating the pupil premium a topup educational services fund targeted at children from lowincome households in a show of lefthand righthand ignorance the government insists that free school meals are the only pupillevel measure of deprivation available one hopes that this is not another detail overlooked in cleggs plan social stigma is perceived as a major factor in underregistration with a properly thoughtthrough system this should not be an insurmountable problem there are very many markers of poverty in the playground from the kids without a warm winter coat or waterproof shoes to the more subtle social index of parties and playdates but free school meals need not be one of them at my childrens primary school no one had a clue who was on free dinners cashless payment systems and confidential management can help more radically school dinners could be made mandatory and free with costs claimed back through taxation from more affluent parents if tax breaks for private education can be administered i dont see why this would be any more unwieldy the adequate nourishment of our poorest children is an urgent and complicated challenge it is not best served by seatofthepants

if you want to foster a kid dont expect to be taking in oliver twist children who need a foster home are by and large both troubled and trouble their family may have broken down they may have been abused or they may be a refugee whatever the reason they need a home it isnt good and as such they are likely to bring a curious mix of absolute vulnerability and worldliness dependence and aloofness they can be surprisingly resilient but because their trust is so warily given the slightest betrayal can result in protracted antagonism sometimes to the point of making the foster situation untenable and though you did nothing to cause their problems youll bear the consequences of them and you cant even give them a good kick up the arse and send them up the chimneys nowadays so why would you want to foster a child and having done so why would you not want them to leave as soon as theyre of age to join the army or get on jobseekers allowance having been fostered out i think i know some of the answers in part it relieves boredom its a project something to do apart from a job it gives one a sense of purpose and identity filling a hole that a lazily indifferent cat just cant fill above all though it is just immensely satisfying for some people to care for someone else who needs it the problem is what happens when the fostered youth reaches age ineligibility and the local authority no longer supports the foster family at the age of social services are invited to develop a pathway strategy that ostensibly leads the child in care to independence at the age of it is unlikely that their problems have gone away by this point they have at most been managed with more or less skill and care by the surrogate parents the complex relationship of dependence and autonomy has only become more difficult to manage to be perfectly honest quite a lot of foster parents give up before it reaches that stage and the youth passes into the care of a local authority group home the evidence of dozens of studies is that children in care whether fostered or in group homes find it quite difficult to make the transition to full adulthood and are more likely to end up unemployed in poverty or homeless to which the obvious response of anyone who has been through the care system is no shit in my experience most of those who leave local authority care as a result of ageineligibility get shunted through a system that eventually deposits them into the cheapest accommodation either with benefits or a lowpaying job they are likely to have poor educational qualifications they move around a lot have a lot of emotional baggage and thus their education is often disrupted where it happens at all as a result children in care achieve on average about a third of the grade levels of other children by the age of they will have no expectation of going further they are more likely to have a child to raise and more likely to be managing depression and other symptoms with booze and drugs none of this reflects ineptitude they are managing their situation with the means to hand based on an intelligent appraisal of their prospects young people pay attention to the signals given to them so the urgency with which the government tends to rush young people out of care is not merely unhelpful it sends a signal it says having prevented damaged teens from doing too much joyriding and shoplifting were no longer overly concerned about what happens to them in that light the recent decision to allow young people to stay with their foster carers with council support until they are seems sensible not because young adults dont want independence but because real independence is always conditional on collective support structures the children of the rich never stop being coddled and gladhanded their way through life the children of the poor deserve a little bit of support before being dumped on to the minimum wage pile the problem though is how this fits into the wider tory agenda the government has already abolished the education maintenance allowance and trebled tuition fees thus setting an expectation that young people from workingclass backgrounds will not progress to higher education they have already spoken of cutting benefits for unders and the cuts to housing benefits already announced have been linked to family values in an invidious way it being suggested that young people should stay with their parents shanene thorpe is one person who experienced the harsh edge of this moralism in her bbc newsnight interrogation in the context of a lost generation of young people left stranded by the recession and a feeble recovery cuts to welfare are leaving young people with no means with which to move toward real independence indeed a sign of the times is the highest share of young people living with their parents in four decades yet simultaneously the welfare cuts also ensure a general increase in the conditions that result in family breakdown and in

children and young people brought up by foster carers in england will be allowed to remain with families until they are if they choose to under a new legal duty for councils ministers will announce on wednesday charities have long argued for a change in the law which currently forces many young people to live on their own at the government has set aside m for local authorities over the next three years to put support arrangements in place the decision marks a uturn for ministers who had previously resisted calls to expand labours pilot staying put programme a scheme that gives young people the option to stay with foster families until they are the labour scheme had been piloted in english local authorities since and evaluations showed that young people who stayed on with foster carers were twice as likely to be in full time education at as those who did not education minister edward timpson whose own mother fostered children said i know from the many foster children i grew up with how crucial it is for them to be given sufficient time to prepare for life after care a growing number of local authorities already offer young people the choice to stay but with little financial support it can be challenging for their foster families this is a further reform to our much wider package of support for care leavers including much greater financial support for young people leaving care at the government will now put forward an amendment at the third reading of the children and families bill in january robert tapsfield chief executive of the fostering network which campaigned on the issue said this change in the law will make a massive difference to the lives of this and future generations of care leavers in england this issue has however not been resolved for young people in wales and scotland we will continue to campaign for this change in the law to be replicated currently local authorities in england fund the cost of children in foster care until they reach at that point support varies across the country in many areas teenagers are forced to live by themselves at an age when others would remain at home statistics from the department for education revealed only more young people stayed with their foster carers after the age of in than in natasha finlayson chief executive of the who cares trust which supports children in care said this represents the most significant reform to the support children in care are given in a generation time and again we hear from young people who are extremely anxious about having to leave their carers when they turn and effectively no longer having somewhere they can call home especially when the average age for young people who arent in care to finally leave home is at least councils said that they would need to ensure the money needed does not come out of already hardpressed council budgets but is fully funded by central government david simmonds chairman of the local government associations children and

imagine taking children who range in age from three to six years on a sledding trip there are three adults to supervise them but the children have to take responsibility more or less for putting on their own snowsuits their hats and their gloves and for taking turns so there are no accidents a health and safety nightmare perhaps but an illustrative example of the preschool childcare culture in denmark a country lauded for its great universal nursery care and parental benefits every child for example is guaranteed an affordable nursery place from the age of one to when school starts at six parents and caretakers are generally permitted weeks paid leave after the birth or adoption between them and this can be taken flexibly for example my husband and i took one months leave together and saved a month which one of us can take before our youngest is nine years old over and above this working hours are less on average than elsewhere in europe you get five weeks statutory holiday and are safe in the knowledge that you can have a day off to look after your children if one of them is sick all these rules and others make denmark a place where families can theoretically win the battle between work and life beyond the legal rules there is a culture that makes it possible for such a system to function on the whole society finds it acceptable that preschool children are looked after by a professional some of whom have completed a threeandahalfyear degree rather than a parent the job of a stayathomemom is in some sense taken over by the state more importantly perhaps is the fact that everyone seems to accept that children should be given as much freedom and responsibility as possible an often cited danish phenomenon is the daily excursion where children walk to play parks or museums twobytwo or holding on to a pushchair which contains the youngest of the bunch there are numerous other examples that illustrate the emphasis of autonomy and taking responsibility that are less well known and are less likely to live up to american ideals of proper child supervision take the use of open fires used to toast snobrd and candles to create a cosy atmosphere in one case there was no fence or hedge in a yard to keep the children from wandering off one child who wandered off luckily chose to go towards the woods and not the motorway all these things can of course still be beneficial to children in their development but might not sit comfortably in cultures which all too often see such freedom as risk the pedgogerne nursery nurses are not expected to be looking at your child constantly and would not physically be able to do so there is no fast rule about the number of adults per child every afternoon at my sons nursery there are two staff to look after children between the ages of three and six according to the national institute of public health the vast majority of accidents that happen to children still occur in the home so there does not appear to be grounds to believe the low adulttochild ratios are dangerous parents also understand that staff are public servants who are accordingly overstretched because free play is the main pedagogical principle close supervision is in any event not required at all times most danish children are selfstarters when it comes to playing they find the most wonderful and innovative ways of learning all by themselves often with few resources drawing a treasure map where x marks the spot girls making sticky name badges for all the boys or groups creating a play to perform to others the emphasis here is of course on the child being selfsufficient and a member of a group dressing and sitting at the table properly and being a good playmate adultled structured activities occur but are relatively infrequent again this seems a far cry from the american focus on didactic activities at every turn even when watching television so it is not only the legislated rules and expenditure that has made denmark one of the best for working families two other vital factors include the almost universal acceptance of an element of risk and the concept of free play if america were to consider introducing more accessible childcare mirrored on the danish model it would certainly have some questions to answer first like would i allow my threeyearold child to go sledding with minimal supervision and if so whos supposed to remember his gloves,2013-12,imagine taking child range age three six year sledding trip three adult supervise child take responsibility less putting snowsuit hat glove taking turn

the women thing is back last week the mp for thanet laura sandys announced she had decided not to stand in citing the demands of the job and the conflict with responsibilities in her personal life the news that a talented backbencher for whom promotion was often forecast was giving up was the cue for a familiar narrative much of it intended to be sympathetic but all of it contributing to one impression politics is an unsuitable job for a woman the rueful commentary suggested among other things that women could not handle life in parliament and that david cameron had been mistaken to put such focus on recruiting them as part of his modernising agenda so miserable was this handpicked cadre according to one wellplaced observer that as many as a quarter of them might follow ms sandys into quieter pastures at the next general election on these very pages a writer suggested it was time for women to man up the departure of louise mensch a woman whose whole life is so untypical that it would be unwise to take her as an indicator of anything to join her family in new york set the tone the facts underline her exceptionalism here they are so far mps are standing down at the next election nine of them are women which reflects almost exactly the percentage of women there are in parliament two are tories ms sandys and another onetermer lorraine fulbrooke who first fought her south ribble seat first in her reason for going she said was that she would have devoted years of her life to parliament and that was enough labours losing five women who between them will have served years in parliament four have been ministers and one tessa jowell was a cabinet minister who may well run for london mayor the lib dems are losing annette brook who has been an mp since and sarah teather whos going in protest at coalition immigration policy the facts just dont support the widely held view that women cant stand the heat the labour women elected in the groups so infamously branded as blairs babes are no different the centre for women in democracys analysis shows only two of the labour women elected then for the first time stood down after one term of them are still in parliament five of them in the shadow cabinet many of the intake were in marginals and lost their seats in perhaps there is a lesson for campaigners in the way the facts are so often traduced many of those who have worked so tirelessly to get fairer representation of women have emphasised the barriers to success they were right to do so and there are still many institutional and human hazards that need shifting but there are other aspects of parliament that are as tough for men as they are for women take the way it works the long and sometimes unpredictable hours or the confrontational nature of the chamber of the commons which is often blamed for making life for women mps particularly difficult but many men would confirm that its a rough job for anyone new mps come in expecting to work hours a week and find its they imagine glamour or at least purpose and find constituents drainage issues they are among the most reviled and abused members of society although theres no doubt that women mps report a high level of sexist abuse social media is unflaggingly poisonous regardless of gender and as caroline criadoperez discovered so terrifyingly a woman with any public profile can be exposed to criminal threats of course there is still a lot to do but its time to celebrate the success of women in politics theres plenty of it mr camerons cabinet is a long way from his promised gender balance but on ed milibands frontbench of shadow ministers are women twelve select committees are chaired by women scotlands deputy first minister is nicola sturgeon and the scottish labour party is led by a woman its time to stop considering parliaments failure to represent society as a problem for women and see it for what it is a problem for everyone,2013-12,woman thing back last week

republican outrage over the inclusion of mandatory maternity coverage in the affordable care act aca continues greg mankiw professor and chairman of the economics department at harvard university and former chair of george w bushs council of economic advisors wrote on his blog random observations for students of economics people who drive a new porsche pay more for car insurance than those who drive an old chevy we consider that fair because which car you drive is a choice why isnt having children viewed in the same way his use of this analogy reveals the simplistic mindset behind the free market criticism of acas maternity care mandate first while mankiw concedes that the goal is to spread the risk of childbirth among the larger community he conveniently fails to note that the maternity coverage mandate serves to eliminate price disparities between the insurance premiums for men and women prevalent before aca from a policy perspective even if an individual woman can choose whether or not to have a baby the prior system placed the costs for childbearing exclusively on women had he thought about the mandate from that angle he might have considered whether the role of childbearer in the family and for society represents much more than just a personal consumption choice and if a policy of treating reproduction as mere choice facilitates gender discrimination second while random observations that equate children with porsches may please wealthy sportscar owners many readers will be uncomfortable with the analogy it conveys a shocking misunderstanding of the value of children and childrearing cars are not equivalent to children children are human beings a fact that distinguishes the choice to have a child from the whims of the auto enthusiast further having and caring for dependent children are societypreserving tasks essential to the future of society and all of its institutions children provide a social good as well as satisfying individual preference a social good quantitatively and qualitatively different from that provided in the production and consumption of cars but putting aside these vital points lets analyze mankiws analogy on his own terms is it unfair to treat a choice to have a child differently from any other consumer decision specifically the preference for a porsche in mankiws view society should either not subsidize either choice or should subsidize both republicans have made their preference on this type of policy question very clear if you can afford a porsche or to have a child fine but dont expect the rest of us to chip in in considering the justness of this analogy we might first ask whether parents should only be viewed as consumers of children for the sake of an accurate analogy they should also be thought of as producers of children there should be two comparisons between producers of children and producers of porsches as well as between their consumers consideration of production raises complexity in this process of production the creators of cars and creators of children could both benefit from state subsidy the production costs for the producers of porsches and other consumer goods are subsidized heavily through regulatory measures such as tariff and tax policy and lax labor laws disfavoring unions its also done directly through incentives such as when communities bid for location of plants or lawmakers slash taxes and make infrastructure investments facilitating distribution of goods or provide other services designed to entice businesses interested in lower production costs and higher corporate profits certainly some of these manufacturing benefits go to the car buyer with a porsche preference the cost of the porsche is likely to be lower as a result of such subsidy but the major benefits of such state subsidies accrue to the producer of porsches delivered through the mechanism of transfer of public funds to facilitate private gain of course society also subsidizes child production but in doing so relies primarily on the concepts of the private family and individual responsibility in which public provision of benefits is not considered investment but stigmatized as connoting dependency even public provision of education is under attack by fiscal conservatives and those who would privatize anything that could be turned into individual profit the business of child rearing simply does not evoke the largesse afforded to the business of car or many other forms of manufacturing and what subsidies currently exist are subject to constant scrutiny and costcutting measures if we recognize the fairness of subsidizing children as well as porches we should also recognize the porsche is not complete when it is designed or its requisite parts are obtained but rather when it is launched into the showroom ready for purchase and fit for the road similarly the production of a child is not complete until decades after birth when he or she becomes a selfsufficient adult that comparison supports an argument for shared responsibility for children that takes us well beyond mere maternity benefits into the argument for social welfare policies benefiting child producers or caretakers and the children they produce it makes it mandatory that society including the market share the costs and burdens associated with not only bearing but also caring for the next generation what about the consumption part of the analogy who are the consumers of children certainly not only parents the state and the market are major consumers of the products of reproduction and caretaking labor parental reproduction also reproduces society providing the taxpayers consumers workers and employers who will populate our future as things stand in the us these beneficiaries are not required to share the costs of production nor do they voluntarily pay a fair price for what they ultimately receive why should reproduction that is essential to society be cast as merely a private choice and therefore solely a personal responsibility one could analogize a different comparison between consumers of porsches and consumers of the next generation reaping the benefits but not sharing in the costs of the reproduction of society is the equivalent of the state and market institutions stealing lovingly created and skillfully constructed porsches at a minimum the term freeloaders seems applicable here mankiws simplistic resort to analogy to address serious and complex social issues obscures the substantially unfair ways parents and children are treated in our society a cavalier let them drive porsches response to the needs of parents trying to raise children in a country with growing poverty increasing food insecurity failing public schools diminished opportunity and access should make us angry children deserve our investment in terms of both money and effort this is an obligation we collectively owe not only to our own children but to all children the growth in inequality that has resulted from our losing sight of this fundamental principle of social justice profoundly undermines the future possibilities for our nations children and therefore the future of

the names of albert adams stephen hoskin and sean miles may not be immediately familiar but their common fate is that they suffered years of harassment because of difference and disability for them as in the horrific case of bijan ebrahimi whose murderer lee james was sentenced last week a false allegation of paedophilia or sexual violence had become a dangerous and ultimately murderous part of their bullying in katharine quarmby published scapegoat why we are failing disabled people the first largescale investigation into the growing number of violent deaths of disabled people in britain in case after case victims had also been wrongly accused of sexual crimes quarmby is now a founder member of the disability hate crime network which last week wrote to dominic grieve the attorney general urging him to review the sentences handed down to james and his associate steven norley the network argues that ebrahimis murder should be viewed as a hate crime that requires longer sentences a hate crime is defined as any that is motivated by hostility towards someone based on his or her disability race religion gender identity or sexual orientation two years before ebrahimis death hidden in plain sight a report by the equality and human rights commission drew attention to a systemic failure by public authorities to recognise the extent and impact of harassment and abuse of disabled people the report points out that public authorities are often aware as in the ebrahimi case of earlier less serious incidents but take no or little action this has the potential to escalate into more extreme behaviour when action is taken it is frequently against the victim not the perpetrators responses by services are often fragmented and uncoordinated the report adds disability is rarely considered as a possible motivating factor in crime and antisocial behaviour as a result the incidents are given low priority the report points out that for numbers of disabled people harassment is accepted as inevitable often the harassment takes place in view of others without being recognised for what it is a culture of disbelief exists around this issue it will be before the independent police complaints commission publishes its report into the circumstances leading to bijan ebrahimis death it is shameful that in the st century people are still being tortured and killed simply
