i love julie bindel there ive said it i love the woman some people love to hate we are bonded by offensiveness when her activities got her into rucks with strangers who knew no better shed pass herself off as me out of sheer malice marvellous she is an adversary to be treasured she is necessary shes clever and quick which sometimes makes her rough and even wrong and yes sometimes rude bindel is also an inventive feminist campaigner who has helped to make life better for some women living the worst lives everyone should be entitled to hear her thinking aloud about gender politics and shes a scream a lowdown standup and she should go on the stage ah theres the thing it is getting as hard to catch sight of her as it is of aretha franklin bindel is in effect being banned airing the complications and troubles of transgender politics is being traduced as transphobia transgender people who used to live as men and now live as women persuaded the may nus womens conference to mandate its officers to share no platform with julie bindel proponents say they are offended by bindels critique aired in the guardian since of trannies perceived cultural conservatism and anatomical violence the nus womens campaign shows no solidarity with women who are offended by the presence in their safe spaces of people who used to be men telling them which women they may listen to and who qualifies as queer this month her enemies mustered a picket outside queer question time in a london pub theyre not censoring her they say you can read her they say just dont go to hear her that renders her audience passive consumers but not engaged debaters by the way the bloggers sexual semantics are interesting women should have the balls to stop bindel speaking theyre offended so what offensiveness is a discourse shared by both politics and comedy offendedness is a privileged protected category in the nus against specifically rightwing extremists racists and julie bindel the womens officer olivia bailey insists this is not no platform for bindel the expression of transphobic views directly discriminates against valued members of our campaign its just that we welcome our trans sisters and a group of them had been made to feel uncomfortable again so what this solidarity does not extend to women who feel unsettled by the presence of people who used to be men in womenonly spaces and services this campaign obscures the question of power and the theory and practise of politics politics is the art of peaceful conflict index on censorship reminds us that conflict and controversy are essential to civil society there is no right not to be offended says padraig reidy index spokesperson to imagine that you should be protected from offense to your sensibilities is neither realistic nor desirable the transgender vigilantes should listen up wise up and grow up participate in not proscribe the debate they started and their best friends in the nus should do what best friends do tell

natasha walter says at the start of her engaging new book living dolls the return of sexism that it accounts for the british heterosexual experience of gender inequality and this it does with genuine insight the author interviews people from all backgrounds including sex workers lap dancers teenage girls and professional women these interviews show how degrading attitudes towards women are silently becoming mainstream its all around us she writes there are more lap dancing clubs on the high streets belle de jourstyle memoirs sold in shops on those high streets bratz dolls that look like soft porn models airbrushed cosmetically enhanced celebrities yes it may well be a choice to be a lap dancer or buy a certain toy but increasingly the choice risks being a false one womens objectification is confused for womens lib and walters scrutiny of this fact makes depressing reading for a young feminist later on she exposes the pseudoscience behind biological determinism referring to a wealth of science that disproves the fact that girls are more caringnurturing than boys or that women are more suited to nursing than say science because of their genes she points out for example that blue was seen as more suitable colour for girls in the early th century according to the media from that time it was symbolic of faith and constancy compare that with the bad science that circulates in the media now everything we are taught to believe in is conditioned and historical writes walter including science including education the naturenurture divide is a bogus one girls and boys are different but so are girls and girls or boys and boys these are simple and logical ideas although walter is wrong about the return of sexism surely it has always existed her book brings back the good feminist fight breaking down the constraints of repressive traditions as gloria steinem put it the first problem for men and women is not to learn but to unlearn at the same time there are certain assumptions in living dolls marketed to young feminists with a snazzy barbara krugerinspired front cover that are incongruous to its aims in one chapter there seems to be more sympathy for the lap dancer who has graduated from a respectable university than a single mother in a seedy club to her disclaimer the british heterosexual experience walter should have then added middleclass as there is no reference to any social or economic inequalities that produce what she calls the nuts culture in a world that seems to have gone nuts just a touch of snobbery towards it some of walters ideas about what a feminist is and does complaining to marks amp spencer about sexist advertising finding genderneutral toys for her children having a good career are disappointing and irrelevant to many people even though this book is a welcome addition to the contemporary feminist canon it excludes so much that would be of interest or concern to those who arent british middleclass or heterosexual of course a book cannot address every person who wants to be represented but as walter is writing about universally accepted ideas of femininity subjugation even childhood the omissions shine through the publicity for the book is equally mismatched two extracts published in the national press have apparently been chosen to incite sensation the first in the times picked up her chapter on pornography and its affects on male intimacy the second in the daily mail on her account of a sleazy audition for glamour models run by the aforementioned lads mag note how the mail took this opportunity to run as many pictures of scantily clad women as possible both extracts are inevitably explicit both newspapers will continue to obsessively publish research on gender that wants us to believe there is an unchanging biological reality an inbuilt gender inequality in a way these two deliberately chosen tasters promoting living dolls undoes its arguments sex as in the hypersexualisation of females in society will always sell damaging equality in the process walter who has been described as one of the uks most important feminists is right there is a growing confusion between sexual liberation and sexual objectification and there is similar confusion between what women should aspire to do and what they shouldnt it is a shame that these mystifications are still somehow being spread by the publication of her own book,2010-01,natasha walter say start engaging new book living doll return sexism account british heterosexual experience gender inequality doe

the government is proposing to allow new fathers to take up to six months paternity leave the change would make it easier for parents to share childcare responsibilities as it would allow couples to take up to months leave between them how would it work new mothers will effectively be able to transfer to their partner some of the months maternity leave to which they are entitled if they decide to go back to work after six months the new father will be able to take up to six months off if they return after seven months he will be able to take five months off and so on fathers will be able to take up to half a year in this way it must be at the end of the mothers maternity leave period will it be paid if the leave is taken during the mothers week statutory maternity pay smp period it will be paid at the same rate as smp currently a week this is on top of the existing rights to which new fathers are entitled what is the current deal men can take up to two weeks statutory paternity leave this must be taken as two consecutive weeks not odd days and be completed within days of the baby being born the statutory rate for paternity pay is also a week or of your average weekly earnings if that works out as less some employers offer full pay and allow workers to take more than two weeks when would the rules change the government hopes to make the new rules law by april and for them to apply to all children born after april how much maternity leave do new mothers get new mothers can choose to take up to weeks of ordinary maternity leave and weeks of additional maternity leave regardless of how long they have been with their employer how many hours they work or how much they are paid as long as they meet certain notification criteria new mothers dont have to take all their

how much maternity pay is available new mothers who are employees are entitled to weeks smp as long as they have been employed by the same employer continuously for at least weeks running up to the th week before the week their baby is due and earning an average of at least a week before tax the legal minimum they will receive is of their average weekly earnings for the first six weeks then up to for the remaining weeks subject to tax and national insurance however many employers do offer more generous packages the final weeks of maternity leave are unpaid unless employers are feeling particularly generous what if a mother doesnt qualify for smp if a new mum is selfemployed or havent worked for their employer for long enough to qualify for smp they might be entitled to maternity allowance to get this they must have been employed or selfemployed for at least of the weeks before the week your baby was due and earned an average of over any of those weeks the standard rate of maternity allowance is or of average weekly earnings whichever is lower this is paid for weeks it isnt subject to tax or national insurance are mums allowed to work for their employer during maternity they are allowed keeping in touch days with their employer mums on maternity can work for up to days and still receive smp some employers will pay mums in full for this or offer holidays in lieu when does maternity leave start it is up to the individual but mums are legally allowed to start it from weeks before the baby is due if they are off sick with a pregnancyrelated illness in the last four weeks before the baby is due then maternity leave will automatically be triggered which means they will get less paid leave after the birth how much notice must employers be given employers dont need to be told about a pregnancy until the th week before the baby is due mumstobe should give a date they intend to finish work and discuss any special health and safety measures that need to be taken into account during the pregnancy is time off allowed for antenatal appointments am employer must let a pregnant woman take time off for any antenatal appointments made on the advice of registered medical practitioners midwives or health visitors this should be paid at the normal hourly rate employers might ask that they try to organise appointments at a time that makes life as easy as possible for them for example by scheduling them at the start or end of the day what happens about going back to work legally an employer must assume new mums are taking their full maternity leave entitlement and strictly speaking they do not have to give notice if they are coming back to work at the end of that time,2010-01,government proposing allow new father take six month paternity leave change would

dads will be able to take up to six months paternity leave while their childs mother returns to work under government plans announced today fathers will have a legal right to take the place of the mother at home for the last three months of her ninemonth maternity leave during that time they would be eligible for statutory government pay of a week they would then be allowed to take an additional unpaid three months off which would effectively allow couples to have a total of months parental leave between them the measure would allow mothers who earn more than their partners to return to work earlier and is a victory for harriet harman the women and equalities minister who has championed extra parental leave and flexible working rights for parents ministers intend to push through the necessary legislation by this april prior to the general election which is expected to be held in may the changes will affect parents of children due on or after april in order to give employers time to adjust last year the government postponed plans to extend paid maternity leave to months and allow parents to split this allowance between them citing the economic climate and the costs and bureaucracy it would cause employers harman said this gives families radically more choice and flexibility in how they balance work and care of children and enables fathers to play a bigger part in bringing up their children weve doubled maternity leave doubled maternity pay introduced paternity leave more than doubled good quality affordable childcare places and introduced right to request flexible working ministers estimate that between and of those eligible for the new leave will take it with only of small businesses expected to be affected the transferable leave announcement was welcomed by the trade union movement tuc general secretary brendan barber said the proposals would help millions balance their work and family life as both parents work in most modern families its right that mums and dads should decide who looks after their baby rather than the state deciding for them by only paying the mother for parental leave he said business lobby groups have opposed every new familyfriendly right from flexible working to extended maternity pay but in reality these changes have hugely benefitted millions of families and have had no damaging effect on businesses the tories speculated that the pledge would be quietly dropped by labour after voters go to the polls shadow minister for women and equality theresa may said labours track record implies that this is a preelection pledge that could be quietly dropped after voters go to the polls labour went into the last election promising to extend maternity leave to a year but have broken that pledge why should

im trying to establish just how often the feminist writer natasha walter gets angry is she ever in a rage before breakfast rarely she says does she ever rant at sexist comments on tv from time to time would she describe herself as an angry person sometimes i think im not the raging sort im on a mission to discover what fires walter up she has been one of britains foremost feminist voices for more than a decade a period in which she has written rationally often compellingly on everything from prostitution to parental leave and pornography to equal pay they are subjects that can provoke real fury and yet walters approach to them tends to be calm sane straightforward which is great of course but her sensibility has always intrigued me its a hoary old cliche that feminists are intrinsically angry a cliche that has been used to undermine feminists to paint us as marauding harpies steam belching from our ears but like all cliches it holds a grain of truth most strong political arguments do necessarily arise from a wellspring of anger so what makes walter furious what drives her we have arranged to meet to talk about her new book living dolls the return of sexism it is organised in two distinct parts and the first finds walter taking a journey through the seedy underbelly of modern culture an excursion that starts in faintly surreal fashion at a babes on the bed competition in a southend nightclub a contest to find a glamour model for nuts magazine its difficult to imagine anyone more incongruous here than the intellectual refined walter especially when the dj starts shouting this is cara brett shes on the cover of nuts this week so buy her take her home and have a wank the uncomfortable scene grows uglier as a series of young women take to a bed and strip off their bras to joggle their breasts before a throng of men the journey continues through interviews with a former lap dancer called ellie who helps illustrate just how sexist the culture has become now says ellie women get told they are prudes if they say they dont want their boyfriend to go to a club where he gets to stick his fingers in someone elses vagina she interviews a woman she calls angela who in describing her work as a prostitute says that basically youve consented to being raped sometimes for money and then theres pornography addict jim who says that porn is way more brutalising than it used to be there is this unbelievable obsession with extreme anal sex its far more demeaning to women than in the past its all enraging material and walter marshals it well but there still seems to be an edge of fury amiss i ask what prompted her to write this first part of the book and she says that it came about after a short newspaper column that she had dashed off it was just a little squib about lads magazines i didnt invest much in it and it was one of those situations where you start getting more responses than you expected one email in particular stuck out a message from a yearold girl called carly whiteley she said that she was starting to think it was time to give up and sit in silence while my friends put on a porno and grunted about whatever blonde airbrushed piece of plastic was in nuts this week what you said gave me back the will not to give in its nice to see someone else saying it makes me feel like less of a prudetype oddball the prude reference was key in living dolls walter takes on the notion that for example stripping and pole dancing are empowering liberating choices instead she suggests it has become increasingly difficult for young women to opt out of this culture to take any path other than that which leads inexorably to fake nails fake tan and finally fake breasts and if they do there are serious social penalties i was surprised by the attitudes of the girls i interviewed she says who seemed to feel that they would be mocked if they protested within their peer groups you know when i was at university in the s it was ok to be annoyed about sexism to take it quite seriously if you argued about it it didnt make you the subject of mockery even if you didnt particularly identify yourself as a feminist you could choose where you wanted to be on a spectrum and you could still say i really dont want page in the common room or i really hate the idea of porn i was surprised when i was interviewing young women that they felt uncomfortable engaging in that way of course a lot them would say its fine we can choose whether to interact with the sexist culture or not and then you dig a little deeper and you realise that it is more problematic than that the focus on popular culture on the pervasive web of sexist imagery and behaviour is a big shift away from walters first book the new feminism which came out in then she argued that feminists should concentrate on specific political social and financial aims in living dolls she writes that she felt that at that time we could put aside the feminist arguments that centred on private lives how women made love how they dressed whom they desired i believed that we only had to put in place the conditions for equality for the remnants of the oldfashioned sexism in our culture to wither away i am ready to admit that i was entirely wrong was she more optimistic about the prospect of equality back then with new labour just elected and women such as mo mowlam clare short and harriet harman riding high in politics totally she says i really felt that we were on an irresistible journey there was still this big gap to close but i felt that we wanted to close it and it was possible to close it and therefore we would we were in a virtuous circle and what i feel now is that policy changes are not enough because the culture is still very resistant to change the books subtitle is the return of sexism and while i dont really think sexism ever went away its stronger than it was its as though something crept in by the backdoor and we turned around and its everywhere and you just think ok weve got to deal with this again walter grew up steeped in politics she was born in to nicolas an influential anarchist once imprisoned for heckling harold wilson and ruth who was also politically active her parents had met in the peace movement and walters mother went on to become a social worker and an avid reader of spare rib she was genuinely committed to feminism in a very true way was there a specific moment when walter herself became a feminist she shakes her head it was just always there they lived in the suburbs and walter went to the exclusive girls school north london collegiate then on to study english at cambridge there followed a stint at vogue and writing for various newspapers before the publication of the new feminism the book came at an interesting divisive period in the feminist movement an era of personal spats between leading feminists played out in public in the mids germaine greer said that suzanne moore had hair birdsnested all over the place fuckme shoes and three fat inches of cleavage a few years before julie burchill and camille paglia had conducted a lively argument via fax machine along came the new feminism and many established feminists took the title as an insult why was a new feminism necessary the book itself was variously described as a work of postpolitical blandness just not serious the product of cyclical amnesia an uninvigorating read with none of the impact inspirational or irritating of a seminal feminist work a book that tends towards the banal new feminism desperately wants not to be a threat to mens egos or womens sex appeal germaine greer said that lifestyle feminists were one of the reasons that she had decided to write the whole woman her follow up to the female eunuch i thought this isnt what it is about at all she said of walters work walter was described as the embodiment of sweet reason and nonaggression much reference was made to her good looks not meant as a compliment and as the response unfolded you couldnt help feeling sympathetic towards her caught as she was in the jaws of a generational shift i ask how she felt at the time and she says that she was disappointed what really pissed me off was that people kept referring to it as some argument for the right to wear lipstick that just was not what the book was about i wanted people to talk about well why are women poorer than men why dont we earn as much it really infuriated me that people werent prepared to engage with that debate the experience seems to have shaken her confidence certainly after i published the new feminism i took a back seat if you had told me a year after that that id be writing another feminist book id say youre kidding im not going to go there again people started saying personal things about me and the way i looked i hated all that there was a slightly bitter tone that crept in territorial i suppose i wonder if she ever lost faith in the womens movement and she says that if im being really really honest i did there was a patch after the new feminism where i felt as though other feminists werent being very sisterly i suppose her faith was revived when she set up the campaign group women for refugee women in a cause she is clearly passionate about and which has inspired some of her best journalism that reconnected me to that basic human rights agenda of the womens movement which was fantastic over the last few years theres been so much well sisterhood thats an overused word but its real and its hugely sustaining walter and her partner have two children clara nine and arthur one and it was becoming a mother that partly inspired the second half of living dolls in this section walter looks at the way that arguments for biological determinism have suddenly multiplied in recent years she delivers a convincing critique of the studies that have been used to imply that children are biologically programmed to fit social stereotypes that boys have a natural love of blue and cars and guns and that girls have a natural love of pink and prams and dolls when walter first had her daughter she says i was hit by this deluge of pink then at friends houses youd walk into a boys bedroom and it would just be blue and navy and full of cars and action men i found that when i raised this even with really liberal parents they would say but boys and girls are just different she just loves pink or its such a pity that he doesnt play with dolls but he just doesnt get it they would be saying this sort of bemoaning it but endlessly reinforcing gender stereotypes in an almost unconscious way id hear things like well he wanted to do ballet but hed be the only boy in the class so obviously he couldnt do it and youd think why obviously the two halves of living dolls provide an anatomy of regression of a culture that has responded to the ascent of women with a reassertion of sexist values the objectification of young women the suggestion that men and women are simply programmed to behave in certain ways and that inequality is therefore inevitable however successful the book is its a welcome addition to the feminist bookshelf and comes at the start of a year that will see two more british feminist books published kat banyards the equality illusion and catherine redfern and kristin aunes reclaiming the f word the new feminist movement walter says that she is excited by the amount of feminist writing and activism that has sprung up recently at the end of her book she briefly profiles some of the key organisations and activists of the last years when i wrote the new feminism i went and talked to various organisations about their work and to be honest i felt i was slightly spinning them in the book because i wanted them to be doing well now i think i can be much more wholehearted young women come up at the end of events and say what can i do can i come and volunteer and theyre so excited and idealistic its wonderful we return to the subject of anger walter admits that shes not a font of fury and that sometimes what you need in this debate are the people who will be enraged and who will really shout and maybe in this generation we dont quite have someone like that of course a lot of feminist books come out of a personal anger from that sense of i have suffered and im going to tell you about that i dont write those books because i havent suffered in that way i just havent i dont have the personal weight of rage that some inspirational feminists have and im not going to pretend that i do its maddening when you feel a comfortable middleclass feminist trying to take the weight of the worlds sorrows on her shoulders instead she says what she does is to put the argument in place and think about it to act as a conduit for the stories of women who have suffered whether its a rape victim seeking refuge or a young lap dancer in london in some ways her lack of intrinsic rage makes walters writing even more admirable particularly considering the opprobrium shes faced she does it out of social conscience out of solidarity she says what better reason is there kira cochrane is the guardians womens editor

women looking for a mr right should give up after and settle for a mr second best or a mr right now lori gottlieb author of marry him the case for settling for mr good enough which is published in the uk next week believes women who refuse to commit unless they find a man with whom they feel a deep romantic love are consigning themselves to a lonely future the theme of holding out for true love whatever that is look at the divorce rate permeates our collective mentality writes gottlieb a yearold single mother who now admits she wishes she had settled for any of the perfectly acceptable but uninspiring men she rejected during her search for the perfect man my dream like that of my mother and her mother was to fall in love get married and live happily ever after of course women are loth to admit it in this day and age but ask any soulbaring yearold single heterosexual woman what she most longs for in life and she probably wont tell you its a better career or a smaller waistline or a bigger apartment most likely shell say that what she really wants is a husband and by extension a child she writes gottliebs book is based on an article she wrote in for the atlantic magazine the piece created such a sensation that it was picked up by oprah winfreys o magazine and polarised readers the debate caught the attention of warner independent and tobey maguires maguire entertainment which bought the book and film rights maguire intends to produce the film himself gottlieb blames feminism for the number of women who find themselves alone after spending years holding out for their white knight to the outside world says gottlieb these women still insist they are selfsufficient but in reality we arent fish who can do without a bicycle were women who want a traditional family she writes every woman i know no matter how successful and ambitious how financially and emotionally secure feels panic occasionally coupled with desperation if she hits and finds herself unmarried it is not just feminism that has betrayed women by telling them they could have it all said gottlieb every book film and television show that perpetuates the myth of combining romantic love with a happyeverafter ending from jane austen to friends has done women a great and dangerous disservice were conditioned to crave that big love its painful how pervasive the fantasy is that the one is out there she said we grew up idealising marriage but if wed had a more realistic understanding of its cold hard benefits we might have done things differently so we walked away from uninspiring relationships that might have made us happy she even claims that settling for mr second best could make women happier in the long run when were holding out for romantic love we have the fantasy that this level of passionate intensity will make us happier she writes but marrying mr good enough might be equally viable especially if youre looking for a reliable life companion what makes for a good marriage isnt necessarily what makes for a good romantic relationship marriage isnt a passionfest its a partnership formed to run a very small mundane and often boring nonprofit business and i mean this in a good way but fellow author elizabeth gilbert believes that women are wrong to believe marriage will make them happy in her new book committed a sceptic makes peace with marriage she writes we marry most often because we are in love and we think it will make us happy yet married women are more likely to suffer from depression than are single women married women are not as successful in their careers as single women she adds the fact is women generally lose in the exchange of vows,2010-01,woman looking mr right give settle mr second best mr right lori gottlieb author marry case

spending his days surrounded by building blocks and overexcited toddlers wasnt exactly what david yates had in mind while studying for his english degree but the sheffield university graduate says he hasnt looked back since deciding to work as an early years professional in a nursery when i graduated i was looking at regular office jobs and it jobs but none of them stood out he says id done voluntary work with young children before in holidays and thought i might as well do something i enjoy and i have no regrets yates has been employed at tinsley childrens centre in sheffield since currently working with twoyearolds youve got to consider each of them as individuals what one child likes to do another wont they cant tell you when theyre tired so you have to be responsive to their moods and instinctively know when its time for a nap at the end of the day in some cases were spending more time with them than their parents are able to the childrens workforce development council cwdc says it needs more graduates to consider working with underfives fulltime in order to professionalise the workforce thom crabbe national programme manager for early years at cwdc says the education level of a childs primary carer has a powerful effect on child development so it follows that increasing the quality of staff in the early years sector can result in better quality childcare someone with a graduate level of understanding can give children a very good start last year the government appealed for more graduates to work with underfives it says it needs more university leavers to join the sector over the next five years to this end the cwdc offers a month training programme to enable graduates to achieve what is known as the early years professional status eyps graduates must meet the national standards set by the government to enable them to work in childcare the course is fully funded for every successful applicant thanks to the governments graduate leader fund worth m so there are no extra fees to worry about at present there are childcare eyps practitioners last september graduates signed up to the scheme more than anticipated if youre thinking about entering the teaching profession at primary level then you might find that early years is suited to you too explains crabbe youve got to have an interest in child development and believe that every child should get the best opportunities possible obviously you need to be quite handson and youve got to like working with young children which needs to be expressed through either voluntary or holiday work the downside to working as an eyps is that the pay isnt comparable to graduate jobs in other sectors even though your eyps course will be funded your starting salary may still leave you struggling in the light of the recession amanda coxen director of childcare recruitment agency tinies says nurseries simply cannot afford to pay graduate salaries so there is no standard higher salary for those with eyps salaries in childcare vary hugely depending on whether you work in a private or staterun daycare centre or nursery according to coxen qualified but not degree level nursery workers typically average an annual salary of in london and in rural areas while managers can expect to average in london and outside the capital but yates says the job satisfaction far outweighs any salary concerns he started on although he has since moved to a more senior position with better remuneration you can either choose a job for its pay or for the satisfaction it gives you he says claire brazierkubus studied business management and sports studies at manchester metropolitan university after an initial foray into pr she decided childcare was the career for her and completed her eyps course last year she now works for a private nursery in twickenham the best part about working with young children the impromptu conversations they say very cute things she says but theres a misconception that all we do is babysitting or playing when actually they are constantly learning through fun so its very challenging and demanding as a job she works from am until pm and admits it can be exhausting you need a lot of energy and it is timeconsuming in the same way it can be for teachers we have to look at every single childs development and consider how to encourage them further but like yates she has no regrets about leaving traditional graduate roles behind we see their first steps and hear their first words its amazing for more information on working as an eyps visit the

according to david cameron the children of the poor dont need financial security to help them make a success of their lives they just need better parents or at least thats the subtext of his recent pronouncements on class and achievement parental warmth he claims is more important than family wealth when it comes to determining a childs future so to ensure working class parents have the requisite amount of it hes pledged to provide them with some relationship counselling apparently theres no longer any need to put measures in place to help lift people out of poverty because its not a lack of money thats holding them back its a lack of character and responsibility relationship counselling should sort that out then well that and a bit of character building of course unsurprisingly harriet harman disagrees insisting that class is still the single most important factor in determining individual achievement harman claims that a report thats due to be unveiled next week will clearly document for the first time how inequality is cumulative over an individuals lifetime and is carried from one generation to the next and how persistent inequality of socioeconomic status of class overarches the discrimination or disadvantage that can come from your gender race or disability without wanting to turn this into the oppression olympics or anything id argue that the intersectionality of gender race disability and sexual orientation can lead to a person suffering multiple forms of discrimination and that this can in turn be a bigger factor in determining individual achievement than class alone but aside from this one caveat overall im inclined to agree with harmans analysis i think its a nonsense to suggest as cameron does that social class or socioeconomic status has little to no influence over an individuals achievements and that all it takes for people to do better in life is for them to adopt a more positive attitude and learn to be a bit nicer to their kids although obviously those things help children who grow up surrounded by love for example are bound to be more confident and successful than those whose early lives are blighted by any form of abuse be that physical sexual or emotional i dont think you need to be a child psychologist to work that one out but to try and argue that good character a sense of responsibility and a loving family background are all it takes to overcome the disadvantages of poverty and class shows nothing more than a profound ignorance of the reality of most peoples lives and an equally profound ignorance of the very privileges that have helped get cameron where he is today i suppose it must be easy for those whose wealth and background have done nothing but open doors for them all their lives to patronise the working classes in this way assuring them that a sunnier disposition and a good old shot of discipline are all thats needed to help get them through after all how can someone who was born with a silver spoon in their mouth and whos enjoyed all the benefits of the old school tie be expected to understand the misery that grinding poverty can bring if youve never had to try and subsist on below minimum wage and if youve never had to face the dilemma of whether to pay the bills or put food on the table instead it must be easy to believe that all thats needed is a bit of blitz spirit and that people might be poor but by jove they can still be happy with it and indeed people can be happy and feel theyve achieved despite living in poverty but i can tell you what would make them even happier and thats not living in poverty no amount of victorian proselytising about morality character and responsibility is going to help raise them out of it though what people need instead are jobs a decent living wage a fairer education system that doesnt privilege the already overprivileged and free healthcare for themselves and their children strange then that we dont hear cameron offering any of those,2010-01,according david cameron child poor dont need financial security help make success life need better parent least thats subtext recent pronouncement class

he spent the entire fortnight playing computer games sleeping in and going to bed late he totally treated the time off as holiday and was having takeaways and wine every night i was so pleased when he went back to work and i was finally left to my own devices who are the authors of these quotes referring to insouciant teenagers perhaps no these are new mothers talking about their partners behaviour during paternity leave according to an article in todays daily mail we fathers may bear many faults in the eyes of our better halves but i find it hard to believe these recollections cast the usefulness of new dads in an entirely fair light sure there are always a few bad apples but how hard is it to get on the wrong side of a sleepdeprived hormonally charged breastfeeding mum anyway maybe it is just wishful thinking but id like to hope that looking back through bleary eyes to the time after our two sons were born i put myself to at least some practical use even if admittedly i can no longer remember exactly what that might have been sadly it looks like those daily mail mums could soon be home alone whether they like it or not the government unveiled its green paper on the family yesterday yet for all the recent noises from people like harriet harman about increasing paternity leave allowance a survey by working families suggests that four in dads still dont take it why is this at present the basic allowance for dads is just two weeks paid leave and the survey shows many employers refuse to top up the rate of paternity pay from the statutory minimum of a week perhaps explaining why said they could not afford the time off it could of course be simply that the games console has packed up but i doubt it the survey also revealed worrying evidence that some employers were either limiting paternity leave to a week or else discouraging employees from taking it at all if it happened to fall at an inconvenient time working families has launched a campaign that will hopefully result in a muchneeded kick up the backside to those firms still lagging behind in this area after all a happy dad is a productive dad is your employer one of those who needs encouraging or

a legal obstacle is to be abolished to make it easier for hundreds of thousands of grandparents to gain access to their grandchildren when contact is denied after divorce and family breakdowns the government will announce today ed balls the childrens secretary will hail grandparents as unsung heroes as he places them at the centre of a green paper on families other measures include offering fathers more support when bringing up children ministers will say employers and health and childrens services in england all need to recognise the role fathers have in caring for children as labour and the tories go head to head on families before the election balls will announce that he is to drop a requirement that grandparents must seek leave from the courts before they can apply for contact with their grandchildren following a family breakdown an estimated million grandchildren are denied contact with their grandparents as a result of adoption divorce separation or family feuds grandparents will still have to win court approval if contact is denied but the change will make this easier by scrapping the need to win permission to apply balls will also launch a website begrand to provide advice and act as a contact point for grandparents grandparents are often the unsung heroes when it comes to informal care arrangements for children and young people balls will say removing the barriers that grandparents face in courts when they wish to see their grandchildren through times of divorce and separation will relieve an enormous burden currently placed on grandparents often when parents separate grandparents are a valuable source of support for children and young people providing them with the stability they need during difficult and emotional times lynn chesterman chief executive of the grandparents association welcomed the change too many grandchildren are denied contact with their grandparents this change will also reduce the legal costs incurred in applying for such an order the tories accused the government of copying their ideas and said the green paper on families did not go far enough to mend britains broken society david willetts who is responsible for the partys family policy said this adoption of the conservative idea to give greater rights to grandparents is a welcome move for far too long the government has focused only on the relationship between mother and baby in doing so they have ignored the other important relationships like those between parents and involving other family members like grandparents but the governments general approach of creating leaflets and websites without confronting the big issues does not meet the challenge that is before us meanwhile iain duncan smith renewing his assault on the government for failing to support families with the launch today of a dossier criticising labours record on the family the former tory leader whose work on welfare and family has been praised by david cameron will say that more than of children are now born outside marriage child abuse has risen by in the last four years and the uk has the fourth highest teenage pregnancy rate in the world he will say the tax system and abolishing the couple penalty in the benefit system will begin to restore the british family to health willetts and balls did a round of interviews this morning as they sought to showcase their respective parties commitments to supporting the family willetts was challenged on tory plans to recognise marriage through the tax system as he denied claims that the measure was tantamount to social engineering pressed on the policy on bbc radio s today programme the shadow minister said it was absolutely right that a government when choosing how it reduces the tax burden should reduce the tax burden on this incredibly valuable and important social institution though he was unable to specify the details of the tax the tories have in mind also taking part in the interview balls suggested that the conservatives would opt for a transferable income tax allowance for married couples which would cost bn a year and would benefit wealthier families while penalising widows divorcees and couples where both partners work the conservatives are saying they will give money to the poorest but for families on low and middle incomes in the middle they are going to take away tax credits and the child trust fund and they are going to have a tax advantage for marriage only if one partner is working and one stays at home which ends up advantaging the rich the children schools and families secretary told today people will look at that and say what a funny set of priorities earlier in the morning the minister was criticised over health visitor numbers by mumsnet cofounder justine roberts on gmtv as he unveiled a guide for new fathers she told balls we did a survey last year of women said they would breastfeed longer and have had a less stressful experience if they had more support from both midwives and health visitors i think the number of health visitors has actually fallen in the last five years her remarks came as the conservatives said they would include a pledge for an additional health visitors in their election manifesto balls said the governments chief nursing officer was working on a plan to increase numbers i want lots more health visitors in the future he

the recession and the difficulty of finding a job are encouraging an increasing number of women to bring forward their plans to have a baby the uk birthrate usually falls during a recession and typically the trend has been for it to continue falling until after the recession ends however despite the longest recession in years rising unemployment and falling house prices factors that might reasonably be considered a deterrent to expanding families many couples seem to be behaving differently the office for national statistics has confirmed that after a slight fall in the number of births in the first three months of last year from babies per women in to in it rose again from april to june from per women in to in even though the uk was and is still officially in recession although the quarterly rise could be a blip maternity units in large hospitals around the uk expect the number of births to continue rising in cardiff and the vale of glamorgan the number is expected to go up by by march year on year according to projections based on last years november figures the liverpool womens hospital expects births to increase by by the end of march some retailers have seen an increase in the sale of baby goods with mamps reporting a rise of almost since last january this picture supports us economist gary beckers theory that unemployment or lower wages will decrease the opportunity costs of childbearing that is you lose less money taking time out of work to have your children making a recession a good time to choose childbearing over employment anecdotal evidence collected by the observer certainly suggests that this time round women are regarding problems thrown up by the economic slump as a good reason for starting or increasing their family some cite the difficulty in finding a new job after being made redundant while others say they are unhappy in their workplace but have been unable to switch jobs emily an estate agent in cumbria said she and her boyfriend are planning to have a baby now because she is so unhappy at work we have been together for three years and ideally i would have liked to have waited another six months or so but things have got quite bad at the firm where i work in the last year with people being made redundant and more layoffs on the horizon i talked it through with my boyfriend and we decided that now would be a good time for me to get pregnant as maternity leave at the moment would be no bad thing it would give me a year away from work in which time things might hopefully settle down another couple ben and julie had been planning to sell their flat in london and buy in brighton where they currently rent before starting a family they now feel the property part of this process may be very difficult because of the slump in london house prices and the lack of homes for sale in brighton but julie says because of the recession my options when looking for a new job in brighton after relocating were distinctly diminished this has meant that i have ended up in a job i may not have otherwise have taken meaning i am less upset and concerned about the prospect of taking maternity leave juliet baptistekelly was made redundant from her job as head of marketing for a building services firm last march while on maternity leave with her son she decided to try for a baby again after struggling to find a new job being made redundant made things stressful financially but we decided wed rather go through all the pain moneywise in one go three or four months into the pregnancy i did feel a bit sheepish about the financial situation there will be months between the children and i would probably have left it another year if i hadnt been made redundant she says likewise emma west had her first child last year as a direct result of being made redundant she was in the process of training and building up the skills to run her own restaurant when she lost her job as restaurant manager for a chain as the economic climate got more difficult it became really unrealistic to continue with my plans she says emma is now pregnant with her second child hospitals are not the only organisations to notice a rise in births the national childbirth trust which supports parents through pregnancy birth and the early years says demand for its classes has boomed during the past months with growth year on year the biggest growth was in the northwest up london and northeast and it has launched courses in further branches this year in addition to the already operating jil matheson the governments principal adviser at the office for national statistics says there are several reasons why the birthrate may not fall this time round the proportion of nonuk born women in the uk has risen and the financial and practical support for childbearing in terms of tax credits and maternity leave has increased since the last recession around she is not even certain that the impact of past recessions on birth rate is clear cut although most demographers taking part in the onss national population projections expert panel believed that recession would have a small downward impact on the birthrate they cited uncertainty of employment and lower household incomes as key factors that could dampen enthusiasm particularly among younger women cary cooper professor of organisational psychology and health at the university of lancaster suggests a more romantic reason for the apparent rise in pregnancies his team commissioned a survey of people across britain about the effects of the recession on relationships he says we presumed that personal relationships would have been adversely affected but research showed that of relationships at home were unaffected with only one in five saying they had been adversely affected cooper says this may be because people who are stressed at work are investing more in their home environment weve worked the longest hours in europe did it give us happiness not really he says its not the amount of money you earn but relationships that make you happy people in difficult times go back to their families for support nesting could be a natural consequence of this additional research by neil roberts some names have been changed having a baby isnt a cheap option the opportunity cost of having a baby during a recession might be low if you are out of work or have had a pay cut but the setup and ongoing costs arent a recent survey for parenting website gurglecom found that of the new mums surveyed the average spent before the childs third birthday was more than

career women make bad mothers an illconceived and insensitive slogan yes but also a highly effective campaign which successfully achieved its aim to provoke a strong public reaction in order to illustrate the enduring potency of offline advertising only a few days after its debut the advert was predictably and perhaps justifiably pulled after mumsnetters caught wind of the campaign of course by that time the point had already been proven im not a mother and sitting on my bed in my pyjamas on a weekday morning im not exactly the epitome of a career woman which explains why i wasnt offended by the slogan instead the reaction to it reminded me of a phenomenon that is becoming increasingly prevalent among my circle of friends and acquaintances ambitious successful and talented women suffering from an everdiminishing sense of humour and an unrelenting need to prove that they are equal if not superior to the men in their lives it seems that showing signs of need weakness dependence or sometimes even personality somehow compromises our quest for gender equality this type of behaviour is perhaps necessary in some arenas when there is still a substantial pay gap between the sexes and people feel comfortable expressing sentiments such as woman ambition bitch in a public albeit anonymous forum women need their armour of cold tenacity and competitiveness but professional battles seem to be increasingly spilling over into personal lives its what i refer to as the superwoman complex so many modern women have fought so hard for freedom and independence that even when we have careers homes and husbands we still cant take a back seat and stop trying to prove ourselves i may be wrong about the wider community of british women but its certainly something i see in my generation of britishasian women who arguably have had to fight harder and longer for independence i am certainly guilty of this type of truculence i react against all forms of dependence stressing time and time again that i am independent and autonomous during the course of my most recent relationship i felt a constant need to prove that i was smart secure strong and selfsufficient i was fiercely competitive and felt a relentless need to prove that i was right a need that almost emasculated the man closest to me in short i couldnt stop fighting i like most women want financial security comfort love and warmth but for those of us who have grown up fighting patriarchy its difficult to allow a man to guide and support us be it a father lover or a boss so what is the solution should a man concede every argument to appease the superwoman in his life should women be allowed to get away with this type of aggressive behaviour or do we need to relinquish the reins once in a while personally i think its unfair to use the men in our lives as punchbags in order to prove our strength a partner shouldnt be a pedestal which we perch upon to prove our supremacy yes we had to fight long and hard for our independence and yes prejudice and inequality still exist but when we find a man who regards us as equal as truly secure women shouldnt we learn to reciprocate that respect the julie bindelss and bidishas of the world are likely to lambast me for saying this but learning to laugh at ourselves and accepting that we cant run faster reach higher or bear more weight than every single man we know is a good first step in freeing ourselves from the shackles of the superwoman complex,2010-01,career woman make bad mother illconceived insensitive slogan yes also highly

the hour was am the date sometime in the late s the place london and lois graessle could be found as she was many mornings riding the escalators at stops along the district line surreptitiously sticking the message this ad degrades women on offensive posters that was the early shift come evening rush hour the stickers and targets would change men in suits umbrella tucked under the arm briefcase swinging would suddenly feel the touch of a womans hand on their back a sticker was left behind this man exploits women these were the early days of the secondwave feminist movement in britain the first wave was the suffrage campaign it was a time says graessle of enormous innocence enthusiasm and creative power when small groups of women were forming across the country talking about their circumstances and feeling the rush of recognition as they realised they werent alone in their frustrations sally alexander for instance was a member of a womens group in oxford and says that the talk would focus on the fact that women were very low paid that we were expected to become either a nurse or a secretary that most women were cleaners women were the poor we were picking our way through exploring the issues a generation was finding its voice that period in which thousands of feminists experienced the first glimmers of consciousness reached a turning point years ago this weekend this was the occasion of the first ever national womens liberation conference which took place at ruskin college oxford between february and march in the definitive history of the event michelene wandors collection of interviews once a feminist the historian sheila rowbotham says that this was the moment from which a movement could be said to exist it was therefore one of the biggest landmarks in british womens history not that the planning for the event got off to an auspicious start accounts of the story differ but in the late s when rowbotham then in her s stood up at a gathering for the ruskin history workshop a popular academic conference and suggested that there should be a meeting about women she was met with gales of laughter from the predominantly male crowd alexander was studying at ruskin at the time and says that i remember sitting on a table and thinking how odd i joined in the smiles but then walked off and thought why did they laugh we talked about it and sheila said well women just arent taken seriously planning began in earnest for what was initially to be a straightforward female history conference then says rowbotham they realised that hardly any womens history had actually been written and that which had was yet to be unearthed so decided to focus on the contemporary position of women instead as graessles sticker campaign showed feminist organising was already under way there had been the highly influential strike for equal pay by female machinists at fords dagenham plant and a womens issue of the revolutionary newspaper black dwarf but the activity was disparate disconnected and it was therefore unclear how many people would turn up at ruskin rowbotham says that they were expecting perhaps a hundred or two hundred people five hundred showed up everybody arrived with their sleeping bags on friday night she says which was turmoil and then they managed to extend the conference into the oxford union an extraordinarily stiff environment that was meant to produce male orators who would become prime ministers i remember being really scared of speaking in that room in once a feminist wandor writes that papers were given on the family motherhood delinquency women and the economy the concept of womens work and equal pay among others mary kennedy who was also at the conference says that there was a real buzz of excitement as a child i had been very angry about being a girl in terms of the way that i was treated because the boys and the men had all the power then here came this turning point and we were all able to speak out the conference was organised by alexander with another young woman at ruskin arielle aberson who would sadly die in a car accident a few months later alexander remembers the conference as exciting and hugely hard work there were many distinct leftwing groups in attendance including marxistleninists who were most forthcoming to volunteer to take minutes says graessle then rewrote them to suit their view of history there was also a small group who caused a dramatic confrontation when they painted slogans such as down with penis envy over ruskin and beyond arielle and i had to negotiate between the police and them between the student body and them between the conference and them says alexander we got the brunt of it they were a very small group and they were very disruptive still the general mood was unbridled optimism catherine hall who was involved with a womens group in birmingham and had come to feminist consciousness after having her first child describes it as a utopian moment its hard to convey now the excitement of discovering what it meant to be a woman and to have a language to talk about that and not conceiving of it as an individual issue but a collective and social issue that was what was most important the recognition that we shared a feeling and experiences that had a name what followed was years of intense activity alexander came down to london after finishing at ruskin that summer and became involved with her local womens group the womens liberation workshop office and the night cleaners campaign you name it she says hall began a womens liberation playgroup and wandor compiled the body politic a collection of feminist writing including a number of papers from the conference it was a time when you could be a houraday activist says wandor partly because of economic conditions we could manage to live on fairly small amounts of money and be flexible says rowbotham and we all lived in shared houses there were many more conferences building on the demands that had been made at the end of that first gettogether ruskin had finished with a session called where are we going facilitated by graessle where all those in attendance voted unanimously on four demands equal pay equal education and opportunity hour nurseries free contraception and abortion on demand the list of the movements demands would swell over the years germaine greers the female eunuch and kate milletts sexual politics were both published in and there was a major demonstration at the miss world contest that year in which feminist activists flourbombed the stage in protest at womens objectification the reaction of the host bob hope pretty girls dont have these problems in there was the first national womens liberation movement march an event immortalised in sue crockfords film a womans place in which groups of women sarcastically sing the ditty keep young and beautiful as they stride forth in the times reported that there were more than groups of women around the country meeting fairly regularly that same year the equal pay act came into force there was a huge amount of activism around rape and male violence in for instance the southall black sisters began their work against domestic violence and legal injustice but by the end of the decade the tumult was dying down it was partly exhaustion says alexander it simply isnt possible to work at such a clip for ever then there were internal divisions a chart produced in defined distinct types of british feminist including eurocommunists humanists and redstockings there was the fact that those who had been in their early to mids in were now building careers and families and so their personal circumstances were changing and then there were the social conditions when margaret thatcher became prime minister in the political tenor of the country shifted radically feminism continued the activism surrounding violence against women for instance has never died away but that defining moment was gone and in recent years the outlook has been that young women arent interested in the movement that feminism is now at best slightly embarrassing associated with flaming bras and battered dungarees and at worst completely dead which is a shame since theres still so much to do just take that first womens liberation demand equal pay there has been improvement on this in the past four decades but as ceri goddard chief executive of the womens campaign group the fawcett society points out women are still paid less than men for fulltime work and i think one of the reasons that the pay gap is still so stark she says is to do with a lack of progress on some of the other asks of the womens movement particularly nurseries but in fact in recent years young women do seem to have been rising again the women of the conference have noticed this rowbotham hall and alexander all went on to become academics and rowbotham says that for a long time her students seemed uneasy about feminism but in the last two years there seems to have been this reawakening of interest when you start to look at the levels of activity theyre actually fairly startling this morning the feminist campaign group object is carrying out a protest against lads magazines being displayed at childs height in supermarkets this evening there is a reclaim the night march in bristol next month feminist activist kat banyard publishes her first book the equality illusion and starts a new organisation called uk feminista which aims to give a platform to all the fantastic activism which is taking place across the country and really support it she says march also sees the third annual million women rise march in london which will bring thousands of women together to demonstrate against male violence suswati basu a young student has been involved with million women rise over the years and when i ask about other activism that she has taken part in recently she mentions a project to support rape crisis centres reclaim the night marches a boycott of the playboy store in london the fem conferences which banyard has been organising since are hugely popular the top capacity for the last one was people she says but there was a really long waiting list so we couldnt quite cope with the demand for it and for young feminists today theres a sense of being part of a worldwide movement which wasnt so true in as zohra moosa womens rights adviser at actionaid says there are grassroots womens rights campaigns now across the globe in central and south america theres lots of work around political representation in certain parts of africa its around leadership and reforms to the law around violence against women a huge amount of activity four decades later the movement seems revitalised born anew that sense of optimism suddenly recaptured and its not as if you have to look far to see the signs just this morning on my way into work i saw a sticker

maria eagle deputy minister for women and equality recently appeared alongside jonathan rees director general of the government equalities office geo in front of mps on the commons community and local government select committee who were inquiring into the performance of the geo in pursuing the governments aims to increase diversity it is perhaps not surprising that eagle sounded a little defensive under questioning from the mps asked by the committee whether the geo exists simply to measure the performance of government on diversity a question that implied the body had little power to force government bodies into action she said it had a great deal of influence we do grab hold of other departments and say youre helping us with this however the figures dont bear that out despite huge social changes in britain over the last years more action is still needed if the public sector workforce and public bodies that run so many of our public institutions are to truly reflect the society we live in when the office of the commissioner for public appointments ocpa published its annual report last year it made a big deal of saying that more women were appointed to public bodies in than the year before thats true but the figures are still below the level of that was reached in and the most recent figures from the cabinet office show that in the six months between april and september only of the new appointments made to bodies in that period were women a decrease of more than on the ocpa figures for only of appointees were from an ethnic minority background up very slightly from in and a mere were disabled down very slightly from the full year figure reported by ocpa the government itself acknowledges that these figures are very disappointing theres been some improvement but its been too slow eagle admitted last month she said the fact that there had been no change in the number of appointments of disabled people and those from an ethnic minority background is just not good enough we can do better than that the public sector she insisted had to be a leader in this field how can we persuade others they ought to be doing better if we cant do better ourselves i am fed up of having lots of white men put forward and being told that theres no one else available i dont accept for one moment that the excuse for such underrepresentation is because people from diverse backgrounds arent interested in going for public appointments or dont have the skills and capabilities to do a good job on public boards the playwright and cultural commentator bonnie greer african american by background but now a naturalised british citizen has become something of a poster girl for the governments drive to increase diversity on public bodies greer deputy chair of the british museum board of trustees says the boards of public bodies are usually composed of people who work and play in the same circles who talk the same language and who are comfortable with one another i didnt understand the rules and i didnt get the banter she says of her early experiences of british public life energy and enthusiasm this has to change ethnic minorities women and disabled people must feel that they own public bodies as citizens and that there is a place for them on the boards of these bodies greer typifies the energy and enthusiasm that can come from having a different voice when she exhorts people to get on the train it is not cheesy but an uplifting call to action and that is just as well because the campaign which is backed by the geo will need all the enthusiasm it can muster it has set high targets with the aim that by next year of new appointments to public bodies regulated by ocpa should be women disabled people and from an ethnic minority background eagle admitting that meeting such ambitious targets will require a big acceleration in effort said weve got to make a really big positive good year when we push this forward jane dudman is editor of public

society lv reveals that parents are typically shelling out a year to feed clothe and educate each new member of their family the new total of does not include private school fees but confirms that even a state education can set families back thousands of pounds in uniforms sports equipment and extra costs such as school trips in total educationrelated costs added up to an average of the report shows that the cost of raising a child has increased by an inflationbusting since january last year and is up over the seven years since the survey began in parents in outer london face the biggest cost in raising a child a record yorkshire and humber is the cheapest area replacing last years cheapest region the west midlands at the new findings show that childcare costs remain the biggest single drain on the familys resources and could add up to as much as for one child between the ages of six months and for a typical household where both parents are working this includes nursery fees afterschool clubs and holiday clubs but this cost represents a rise of just on the same figure in january the lowest rise of any category suggesting childcare costs could now be levelling out mike rogers group chief executive of lv said every parent will know how expensive it can be to raise a little one and as parents we know we dont begrudge a single penny of it but i suspect many new and prospective mums and dads will be a little shocked to see the potential financial burden ahead of them the recession has continued to take its toll with more than threequarters of parents polled for the exercise admitting it has forced them to rein in their family expenditure but things are not as bad as last year when research showed that marginally more of parents said they were having to do the same then holidays and fun days out have been hardest hit with of parents saying they have had to tighten their belts in these areas the make do and mend mentality is beginning to show itself too with of households saying they have reduced their spending on clothes cashstrapped households show imagination in attempting to stretch their budgets even further seven out of said they regularly shopped for cheaper groceries and opted for bargain basement supermarket items from value ranges a third of parents were buying secondhand items to help make ends meet with selling unwanted items

face having to pay out a staggering a year that includes the cost of a first car fees and living costs for a threeyear undergraduate degree however student loans and any income earned by students are

childcare is rapidly rising in the past year costs went up by more than twice the rate of inflation despite the uk being in recession the fact that a parent working parttime earning an average wage

what is the french model of motherhood elisabeth badinter author philosopher and feminist has caused a bit of a stir by suggesting that french working mothers having long resisted the model of the perfect mother are now under pressure from a variety of quarters to stay at home and look after their babies its a step backwards she argues because good motherhood breastfeeding for months on end saying no to disposable nappies above all taking years out from fulltime work contravenes the model we have worked for until now and makes sexual equality an unrealisable dream her remarks have needless to say drawn criticism not least from some british women but badinters views are framed by a french view of working motherhood which and i say this from experience is quite different from britains not necessarily better i hasten to add but different for some decades now the french government has pursued with considerable success a farreaching policy aimed at boosting the nations fertility rate and increasing the number of women in the workforce it did this by ploughing millions into subsidised readily available and easily affordable childcare it established a system of municipal cooperative and parental creches equipped to take babies as young as three months and opened preschools maternelles which every french child over the age of three or even outside big cities two could attend from am to pm with a half day on wednesdays for free every day on the same premises an afterschool club called centre de loisirs is open until pm staffed by municipal employees for a few euros a week these centres with extra activities and day trips are also there during school holidays again until pm for a meanstested fee of between cents and day including meals it may be considered inhuman here but i brought up two happy children in paris this way i returned to work fulltime when each was four months old they went to a municipal creche that when both were there fulltime cost us a total of a month like every french child i know my son went to maternelle the year he turned three in his class of there were only two mothers who were not working i came to england when his sister was three to discover that there was no fulltime state preschool provision here and that most childcare in london at least was unbelievably expensive i spoke to mothers who told me horror stories about the proportion of their salaries that went on childcare and of creches that fined them when they arrived minutes late because theyd got stuck in traffic i have met others who are fortunate enough to have been able to decide that this wasnt for them and have instead taken four or five years out of their careers or retrained to work around their children what i also discovered here however was the delight of spending more time with my children when i was in paris i didnt understand english and american friends who said but you never see them now i look at some of my paris friends and part of me agrees the other part thinks lucky them their career is still on track no one of course can judge the decisions parents make about all this but surely the availability and affordability of the kind of childcare structures that are commonplace in france and for example scandinavia must influence the choices women make and choice is what this ought to be about how many mothers here would opt to work more if it was made easy for them conversely how many mothers in france would like to take more time out with their children but feel overwhelming social pressure not to only when we are genuinely free to choose whether and when and how and how much we want to work as mothers will this be less a debate about nappies and breastfeeding and the ruinous cost of childcare

the cost of a nursery place for children aged over two rose by twice the rate of inflation last year while childcare for a toddler now swallows half the gross earnings of an average parent in england working parttime according to a report out today the findings of the annual survey by the daycare trust the national childcare charity show that despite the recession nursery fees rose by with yearly parental expenditure in england topping parents in london pay the most with nurseries costing as much as a year that equates to a week for hours of childcare however other regions are catching up fast east midlands and yorkshire reported a jump in nursery costs for children aged two and over while parents in the humber area saw the price of childcare rise almost the charity said its survey compiled from figures submitted by the family information services highlighted how parents are facing the strain of losing jobs or having hours cut back or facing pay cuts all of which is compounded by childcare costs shooting up alison garnham the chief executive of the daycare trust said the figures were shocking and called on the government to extend the entitlement of free nursery care to all children over two at the moment children over three qualify for hours of governmentfunded childcare although this is set to rise to hours garnham said that free care should be extended to hours by the trust estimates the government spends about bn on early childhood education and care with a further bn a year spent on sure start centres which provide nursery places although the government does offer free childcare it is often not delivered locally as money is swallowed up by schools other monies can be collected through the tax credit system about working parents collect childcare vouchers which are governmentsubsidised from their employers the only way to bring down childcare costs is more public subsidy said garnham who pointed out that britain lagged behind its european counterparts when it came to state funding of facilities in europe it is either universal provision or meanstesting but basically the state pays for nurseries here we are trying to improve quality by charging fees parents cannot afford to pay at the moment the maximum subsidy is of the total costs through the tax credit system this needs to rise to lisa leonelli a mother of a twoyear old girl and threemonthold twin boys said she faced a possible nursery bill for her three children of more than a month too much for her to return to work at the moment i work three days a week and my daughter goes to nursery the cost is a month i have a good career and wanted to go back but with the twins it is just too expensive leonelli and her husband collect childcare vouchers which amount to of taxfree income but she said it was not enough i did not choose to have twins but through no fault of my own i cannot afford to go back to work id love the cost to come down but i dont see how dawn primarolo the childrens

writer and nyu professor clay shirky thinks women should behave more like men to get ahead in the world not enough women have what it takes to behave like arrogant selfaggrandising jerks he complains in his blog adding that women are rubbish at behaving like selfpromoting narcissists antisocial obsessives or pompous blowhards when it would be in their best interests to do so this is the reason he insists why women are neither as successful nor as famous as their male equivalents for all his good intentions to spur on the female workforce there are major faults in shirkys argument to begin he equates assertiveness with arrogance narcissism and pomposity these are hardly concrete associations and i would advise him to look up the meaning of assertiveness in the oed for clarification he then links assertiveness exclusively to the male gender in doing so he suggests that unassertiveness is a malady chronically afflicting only the fairer sex the argument that inequalities between men and women boil down to personality differences is reductive far more complex socioeconomic situational and historic issues are more compelling factors explaining why women are still finding it difficult to break the glass ceiling in the business world headhunter spencer stuart reported in december that women represent just less than of directors in the biggest companies likewise a quick flip through the latest edition of the norton anthology of english literature reveals that out of authors less than a quarter are female this is not to say that i dont see some merit in shirkys argument but i wondered should women really start behaving like men to find out i signed up for a pilot assertiveness training workshop organised last week by the oxford university student union run by dr peggy frith the workshop is designed to encourage male and female students to express their views more clearly and with confidence when discussing tricky issues with peers and seniors not quite sure what to expect on the day i was crossing fingers for two things a that it would not involve improv or any other form of method acting and b that i would successfully pass as an undergrad rather than a confused woman who wandered into the wrong room on the day i arrived to find the place full a quick scan of the room revealed that attendees were divided equally between men and women the course began with a presentation by frith on the theory of asserting we were later grouped into pairs to put the theory into practice despite my precourse dread of acting i couldnt wait to try out friths sixstep script use your colleagues name name the topic explain what you understand their position as state your feelings and what you would like point to the positive outcome for them and for you my partner and i chose a simple scenario asking for feedback from an editor or a tutor on a submitted piece or essay beaming at the end of my spiel confident that i had successfully asserted myself i was met with a rueful smile you werent very assertive said my partner saying that you know hes very busy and asking whether if he can make time for you makes it seem like its an option insist on feedback you also have to articulate your feelings better initially deflated i soon realised this yearold was quite right unable to accept defeat i practiced the sixstep script whenever i could following the course at the corner shop at work on my friends at a restaurant on a cab driver on my flatmate my efforts have been met with considerable success concessions that i never have to buy toilet paper for our flat ever again a discount and promises of an arranged meeting with son from a taxi driver who had taken the wrong route an apology and a fresh bowl of soup this time without a floating kinky hair strand a few more commissions free reeses cups i asserted myself and told the corner shop owner they must restock it at once all this without being an arrogant selfaggrandising jerk i couldnt exalt the benefits of assertiveness more while i no longer have no qualms asserting in the words of shirky how awesome i am to my employer i dont think ill be finding my inner arrogant jerk any time

on average men and women in britain vote for the three main parties in roughly equal numbers so how do we explain the recent interest in the mumsnet phenomenon the three main party leaders have all participated in webchats on the site and there has been several predictions that the mothers of small children will be a key target during the election campaign pippa norris of harvard and ronald inglehart of the university of michigan have identified a global trend where as women have entered into education and employment and become less religious they have moved to the left of men on the political spectrum in more conservative rural societies where women follow traditional gender roles they tend to be more morally conservative so that religious women from the south of the us are actually more republican than southern religious men the opposite of the trend among secular educated women in the northern states for example in the us women have voted for the democratic presidential candidate in greater numbers than men at every election since traditionally in britain women were more likely to vote for the conservative party than men but in this pattern was reversed among younger men and women analysis of the british social attitudes survey revealed that the difference was greatest among middle and high income mothers this group of women is an obvious target for political parties because data shows that women tend to prioritise different issues from men and they wait until later in the campaign before deciding whom to vote for women are more likely than men to say that health and education are the most important issues facing britain men are more likely to say that the economy and taxation are most important although in the current climate both men and women are overwhelmingly most likely to say that the economy is the most pressing issue this is why labours slogan education education education probably won over more women than men labours allwomen shortlists may also have indirectly helped the party among women voters voters with a feminist orientation were more likely to vote labour in but this relationship was most pronounced among women under the age of on average women are less interested in partisan politics than men and they are less likely to have a stable and longterm attachment to any particular party according to the december british election study cms conducted by yougov of women and of men had not yet decided how to vote this figure excludes those who are certain not to vote and women are no less likely to vote than men thus if the parties are targeting undecided voters they are likely to target women first david cameron has made regaining the conservatives historical advantage among women voters a core part of his election strategy shortly after being elected leader he declared that it was the conservatives goal to tackle gender inequality by increasing the number of female conservative mps closing the gender pay gap and addressing childcare issues the parties are clearly well aware that although there is little top line difference between the way men and women in britain cast their votes there are key

whatever it is you ask directions to be it the toilet the lavatory or as the effete americanism would have it the rest room you are on your way to a place where social mores and taboos are going to be exposed those in any doubt about this should consider how abruptly one is brought up short by a modern loo that plays with conventional expectations it is pretty unsettling for instance to come out of a cubicle and wash your hands in front of what you presume to be a mirror only to find yourself staring into the face of a man washing his hands on the other side of what is normally a great and fairly welcome gender divide whether it is a question of the etiquette of queuing or a question of hygiene and how distressing it is to see a kitchen worker walk by the basin without washing their hands we seldom leave a public convenience without feeling we have taken part in a unique communal ritual sally feldmans clever and unflinching discussion of the subject in last weeks new humanist reveals much of the new thinking about what we do and asks why we are not better at celebrating how far human ingenuity has improved the whole business of going about our business at least for the privileged classes feldman notes that jokey public toilets are on the increase with men now offered the dubious bonus of peeing into urinals shaped like womens lips and women offered the chance to turn taps fashioned after male genitalia londoners may also have come across loos with goldfish living in the glass cistern and stalls where the clear pane in the door frosts over automatically on locking feldman believes japan is ahead of the field here though with toilets that not only wash and dry you but tell you how fat you are and where you are in your menstrual cycle most significant though is that it is obvious loos are a feminist issue the kind of sanitary provision available to a social group is a clear marker of their status feldman quotes rose george who went around the world sampling what was on offer for her book the big necessity adventures in the world of human waste not only did she establish that poor sanitation remains the root of one in of the worlds illnesses she found that it is still the poor children and women who take the brunt of the pain public conveniences were introduced in britain in the s yet it was years before they bothered making some for women and there are still far fewer of them although as george points out careful research has established that women take seconds to urinate while men take should the situation ever be evened out for women

how does a man demonstrate that he is great if he presently leads the conservatives or labour hell be keen to suggest he must be great himself because he has such a great woman behind him no one knows quite where the ubiquitous homily originated but it was popularised by the feminist movement not to emphasise the importance of acquiring a supportive helpmeet of course but to point up the invisibility of female contributions to male achievement such contributions are no longer invisible far from it yet no politician looking to burnish his greatness would now dare to suggest that the great woman behind him was a supportive helpmeet alone judging from their choice of partners and one is fulsomely invited to gordon brown and david cameron have very similar ideas about what a modern woman and wife should be both are proud that their wives carved out independent careers both like to pay tribute to the primacy of their wives in matters of childcare although they are also careful to underline their belief in active fatherhood it would be sacrilege to suggest that the two women choose their clothing so carefully and lavish attention on their hair and makeup for any reason other than their personal satisfaction but given that the appearance of women in the public eye is so forensically scrutinised both men must take some pleasure in the fact their gals are so very willing and able to play that game both presumably are also extremely grateful that no matter how admirable and ambitious their wives are in their own right they are never too busy to put the ambitions of their husbands first can it have been merely serendipitous the sudden emergence of an onthecouchtalking samantha cameron days before her latest pregnancy was announced probably not this was good media management the immediate clamour to hear from an erstwhile silent preelection babycarrying leaders wife would have been deafening by speaking before the main topic for discussion became public property mrs cameron gained herself some privacy there is general agreement that a new baby in the offing will do nothing to harm mr camerons election prospects but there is a certain amount of shyness about analysing just why that might be partly it is natural reticence of a kind all too unfamiliar in the present media landscape new babies are wonderful while the death of a child is unspeakably sad only a flinty soul could fail to feel happy for the camerons when they have endured such great misery bitter tirades about opportunistic conception would in this situation be tasteless in the extreme as well as paranoically farfetched anyway there can be no doubt that the camerons have made a hard choice not an advantageous one i do understand that the couple have wealth and that wealth buys much support in bringing up a family but still a more pragmatic decision might have been to maintain the familial status quo what with the expectation that dads going to be up to his elbows saving broken britain in a matter of weeks i wouldnt fancy having a baby under the circumstances that mrs cameron has blithely taken on and i find her selfassurance admirable it also has to be said there are plenty of men who would cavil at being thrown the curveball of an infant just as they are looking forward to being the king of a troubled castle cameron is fond of declaring that family must come first and in that respect he is putting his money where his mouth is yet there is an unsettling aspect to the vision that has been set before the electorate of a family quite unfazed at the prospect of having it all power glamour and the patter of tiny feet it is actually nothing new this process whereby wives canvass for their husbands women were expected to get out on the stump long before they could take part in the political process even by voting in those days it was assumed that women supported their husbands ambitions the fact that women now feel the need to advertise their support is at least an admission that a sympathetic spouse is an advantage to be boasted of rather than taken for granted and yet it is a small step forward this progression of political wife from appendage to trophy for there can be no doubt that mrs camerons choice works as an extension of her husbands policy stance just as fortuitously as sarah browns public relations expertise is useful in allowing her to work a reception in a way her husband cannot cameron is well known for his belief in the importance of traditional family structures as the primary building blocks of a healthy society and he very much likes to play up this link hes less keen publicise how close this observation comes to thatchers notorious declaration that there is no such thing as society which she qualified by adding there are individual men and woman and there are families voters are exhorted in conservative advertisements to take a look at the partys policy proposals for the family yet those policies are pretty thin there will be an end to the couple penalty in the tax credit system along with a reform of the administration of taxcredits more generally to reduce fraud and overpayment there will be a refocusing of sure start so it reaches only the most needy families there will be continued commitment to the provision of free nursery care along with a review of the way the childcare industry is regulated there will be more flexible parental leave and stable funding for relationship support which couples will be given greater encouragement to use it is notable that barely any of this does anything other than tweak or reorganise initiatives that have already been firmly embraced by labour these policies dont place families at the heart of society economic society in particular they instead attempt slightly to mitigate the difficulties of parents whose background and circumstances dump them closer to the margins of society far away from the effortless gilded ideal that both party leaders project from their own family arrangements that ideal declares that part of being a man who has it all is having a wife who has it all too including a man worth standing behind this may not represent an intellectually proven political consensus about the place of women in contemporary society but it surely explains why there is such widespread discomfort about the prominence of wifely

anne perkins is right the escalation of attention given to politicians private lives is an evolutionary setback continuing saturation coverage of the telegenic wives of party leaders highachieving women in their own right constantly under pressure to churn out some bland domestic titbit obscures an important moment for real political women especially as we come up to a possibly epochdefining general election in particular patricia hewitts suspension from the plp is a sadly symbolic moment in the story of the generation of women whose original promise stalled if not shuddered to a halt in recent years yes blairs babes was a soundbite a cheesy photocall on the terrace of the house of commons but it also represented the culmination of a long struggle within the party and wider feminist culture to promote womens serious participation in serious politics where are they all now there are currently only four women in the cabinet and seven women in the shadow cabinet pitiful figures both more broadly the uks current level of female mps is placing us th in the world clearly political culture particularly at its highest level where the big decisions get made remains inhospitable to women its amazing how many new labour women have come a cropper in one way or another over the years estelle morris jacqui smith beverley hughes hazel blears clare short ruth kelly oona king and now patricia hewitt mo mowlam was finished politically speaking well before her tragic death of course the fate of these women is tied to the failings of the new labour project and is not always genderspecific a lot of the men have fallen too but it goes deeper than that take morriss resignation as education minister in with painful honesty morris talked in interviews about how she didnt feel up to the job the effect of media intrusion and the cumulative impact of pressure her going was sincerely regretted by her colleagues but it led to no deeper soulsearching within the party or government its easy to see why for women to admit to lack of confidence about public and political life is to open the floodgates of daily mail reaction a giant chorus of i told you sos but that doesnt mean the problem isnt worth thinking about in safer places modern politics has also taught us how marginalised women can become by socalled sofa government blair relied on a tight circle of male colleagues and unelected women such as anji hunter and sally morgan cameron too seems to rely on a small tight group of male colleagues and advisors oh and theresa may but surely the single biggest obstacle remaining to women in politics is worklife balance tessa jowell a rare survivor once revealed how she dealt with her workload by more or less going without sleep one night a week it was a thursday if i remember rightly oona king was down to two hours sleep a night financially depleted nearing divorce her personal life in chaos by the end of her illfated campaign to keep her east london seat women in politics still face a double whammy they rarely have the kind of supportive spouse who keeps the home fires burning deals with all the administrativesecretarial work and keeps the dvd home viewing this side of respectable at the same time they are doing a difficult job often requiring unpopular decisions opening themselves up to the kind of criticism that so very quickly merges into misogynistic contempt harman obviously has nerves of steel morris didnt dont we want both kinds of women in politics contrast this with the approval showered on the loyal political wives it is so easy to admire a woman who is not losing sleep over making the big political decisions who stands by her man at every turn theres nothing wrong with loyalty to a public partner wed probably all do it if we had to its just got nothing much to do with politics its showbiz its a bittersweet romcom with a happy ending on one level its obvious what we still need more familyfriendly political and parliamentary timetables along the model of the scottish and welsh parliaments more powersharing between the sexes at the top perhaps by decree as harman tried and failed to introduce when she first won the deputy leadership even more women standing for parliament but as the coverage of the loyal political wives shows its as much a struggle to be waged out in the world as within formal politics its about how we create realistic structures for our daughters to help them balance personal and professional lives keep believing in themselves and fighting for the things they believe from glowing

mps plans for a dedicated house of commons nursery have been have criticised as an expensive indulgence by one of the childcare companies asked to tender for the contract the total cost of the creche being set up in a converted bar in the palace of westminster is understood to be a year and it is expected to be open for weeks a year it will provide places for around children and is intended primarily to help mps who have to attend debates and work in the commons it will offer spaces to children aged up to five other westminster staff will also be able to take advantage of the childcare facilities on occasions the nursery may remain open until as late as pm to offer emergency childcare a proposal that envisages exhausted politicians returning to their london homes late at night taking home their sleeping infants ben black managing director of the childcare providers tinies and my family care told the guardian that the money would be better spent offering credits to use existing nurseries and employ nannies or childminders at mps homes rather than at their place of work i am probably not alone in finding the idea of a dedicated nursery in the house of commons very hypocritical black said those children should be tucked up at home in bed late at night black said it would be better to allow mps to use existing nurseries providing credits to mps to use existing childcare infrastructure may be politically unacceptable and using nannies may sound like it is something only for the middle classes but it would be better value this scheme wont provide flexible backup care the house of commons could give every mp sessions or days of emergency childcare per year anywhere in the uk the total costs of that would be about k per year other public sector bodies run successful childcare programmes without setting up a dedicated nursery he said we run an emergency childcare scheme for various private and public sector employers including various nhs trusts and even some work for the treasury we have very successful operations such as the westminster holiday play scheme which organises activities of children who work in government agencies and departments those schemes could be used many existing nurseries were crying out for children to look after black added,2010-03,mp plan dedicated house common nursery criticised expensive indulgence one childcare

what is to blame for the persistent lack of women in the hard sciences and in technology the new york times explores what the writer katrin bennhold describes as risk and opportunity for women in the st century the article explains that the number of women in the sciences has steadily declined despite record levels of need in areas such as computer engineering and chemical science this genderbased career stagnation flies in the face of workforce trends that are placing women in increasing roles of prominence and power across all sectors with the promise of higher income and innovative work women are certainly wooed by the idea of scientific and technological careers yet women lag far behind men in the pursuit of science and tech studies research has shown that a variety of factors leads to the underrepresentation of women in the sciences in addition to the steep learning curve and unforgiving schedules which makes it difficult for women with families to rise to the higher ranks of their profession stereotyping also plays a role as historical constructions about the aptitude and intelligence of women continue to surface bennhold refers to one outdated mode of thinking that is still popular in scientific circles the idea that the brains of women just arent wired for hard technology or hard sciences while this is a myth it was most recently invoked in by the former president of harvard university the answer to ending the disparities may lie in an unlikely source the games industry gender and game researchers most notably in the academic collection beyond barbie and mortal kombat point out that women face discouragement at just about every exposure point to video games this type of casual discouragement means that women are not told outright not to play games or participate but instead receive those messages through socialisation girls are encouraged to spend more time on their social skills and gender appropriate activities while things such as coding and playing with computers work against these norms placing young women who do enjoy these activities in a bind combined with harsh treatment by instructors and peers fewer role models and fewer mentors these factors quietly inform women that the science and tech sector is not a place for them many of these problems feed on each other if women are not acknowledged for the work they accomplish there are less female role models to show to girls interested in science if women cannot receive recognition for their accomplishments in the sciences they may end up changing careers if instructors and classmates believe the stereotypes about women and the sciences women will be judged more harshly for mistakes and receive less support increasing dropout rates if less women graduate with degrees in science and technology less women are available to compete for positions so what can be done about this back in the website livescience created a piece specifically to debunk myths about girls and technology and focused on changing the curriculum to be more femalefriendly they note the mentality of needing to weed out weaker students in college majors especially in the more quantitative disciplines disproportionately weeds out women this is not necessarily because women are failing rather women often perceive bs as inadequate grades and drop out while men with cs will persist with the class effective mentoring and bridge programmes that prepare students for challenging coursework can counteract this outside of reviewing how we grade and evaluate skills techbased summer camps schoolbased instruction and community outreach from science and technology professionals really goes a long way in ensuring girls will have the opportunity to explore and develop their talents before being discouraged from the field parents and educators should vigilantly watch the messages that girls are receiving about their role in the world after all the future of science is at

the government will this week announce plans to overhaul maternity wards to make room for extra beds and allow new dads to spend the first night of their childs life with their family under the reforms the nhs constitution will also be rewritten to give pregnant women a legal right to chose where they give birth including the option of a home birth the prime minister gordon brown revealed yesterday during an online chat with the netmums website to mark mothers day the plans are part of a fiveyear programme of the reform of childrens services from birth to the age of five to be announced this week by the health secretary andy burnham and childrens secretary ed balls the move is designed to appeal to middleclass families and mothers in particular women with young children have been identified in polls as a key target for labour votes in the election there are constituencies where mothers could swing the result prompting a run of familyfriendly policies the work secretary yvette cooper revealed on sunday separate plans to encourage more flexible working to attempt to break the culture where parttime work is seen as a deadend in careers all jobcentres are to ask employers to consider offering jobs they advertise on a flexible basis when they advertise brown revealed that he wanted to end the situation where the mothers partner is not allowed to stay the night with their new child after their birth many hospitals already supply makeshift beds and more are being built with private rooms instead of wards but many still operate strict visiting hours asking dads to leave their new family at night brown said he wanted a change in the service to include fathers in their new families from the beginning he wrote maternity services should definitely remain a priority for the nhs we have almost doubled funding since and theres no doubt that our maternity services have got better over the last years but sometimes i think we havent done enough to make sure they provide a really personal service for mums and dads over the next few years we want to see a legal right for mums to choose where they give birth including home births for anyone who wants one and we want to see services changed so that not just mums but dads can be given a bed if they need to stay in hospital overnight after the birth of their baby we have also set a goal to recruit an extra midwives by mothers can already request a home birth but the likelihood of getting one is almost entirely dependent on the availability of midwives ministers privately accept that maternity services have not been reformed enough and hope that giving parents legal entitlements will force further improvements to meet the aspirations of middle class families in particular under this weeks plans the nhs constitution will be rewritten to include a new legal right for pregnant mums to choose where and how they give birth including the option of a home birth the proposals will be consulted on and introduced in the next parliament plans to give both parents a bed for their childs first nights in hospital would also be completed within the next parliament further reforms to improve postnatal care and an extension in postnatal support for teenage parents to reduce the chances of further teenage pregnancies will be set out on tuesdaymary newburn head of research and information at the national childbirth trust said we support both those measures but the key thing is that significant investment is needed to make them happen so far we havent seen the investment required to implement their current policies parents were supposed to be able to chose the place of birth by the end of last year our research shows there has been some improvement but there is still a long way to go it would take an enormous building programme to accommodate new fathers so im not sure how fully thats been thought throughit would be fantastic if there was scope for more family rooms but it would mean a building programme,2010-03,government week announce plan overhaul maternity ward make room extra bed allow new dad spend first night child life family reform nh constitution

im anna arrowsmith the liberal democrat ppc for gravesend or as many will know me anna span the uks first female porn director take your pick since news of my selection broke on thursday many people have asked me why i want to be an mp the answer is for exactly the same reason i decided to start making pornography for women more than years ago someone had to do it and it didnt look like anyone else was going to at least not with the drive enthusiasm and determination that i could offer the unfortunate truth is that there are far too few female mps in this country compared to the rest of the world did you know that rwanda has the highest number of female mps of all countries at imagine living in a country with a female majority well here i am again thinking that another maledominated field needs challenging back in i was in the final year of my degree studying film at central st martins college of art amp design i had decided to write my dissertation on what fundamental changes would need to be made to mainstream pornography in order for it to be enjoyed by women i called it towards a new pornography intending it to sound like a manifesto more for my own amusement than anything else then came lesson one in the british psyche even the socalled experimental filmmaker lecturers at this outstanding college were actually conservative with a small c my adverts for performers to appear in my graduation film were defaced and torn down by members of staff and my final film was refused a public airing for fear of upsetting peoples grandparents according to the head of the department all this for a film where the sex was actually simulated due to lead actor issues twelve years later i have won many awards including indie porn pioneer at the international feminist porn awards in toronto and best director for two years in the uk i have fought long and hard for womens right to sexual expression and consumption as well as for freedom of speech i have long since felt vindicated about my choices back at college and know my prosex feminist argument is based on sound principles and logic so why dont i stay in my industry and continue to reap the rewards of my efforts because i am the type of person who needs a challenge i achieved much in my last career and now i want to broaden my campaign to other pressing issues such as why this or previous governments dont think they have a responsibility to give young people something productive and engaging to do with their spare time i lived on a council estate in bermondsey and saw first hand why the kids were taking drugs fighting and committing crimes they are simply bored i want to campaign to give young people in gravesham the help they deserve to do this i have to fight yet another old mans club only this time without the dirty raincoats some wont like it theyll assume that my selection means the world is going to hell ive been here before last time i changed my industry for ever that among other issues is why i am making the transition from porn to parliament watch this space ive got a lot of for want of a better word balls,2010-03,im anna arrowsmith liberal democrat ppc gravesend many know

its been an endless source of aggravation between the sexes how can men so easily forget birthdays anniversaries and even friends names not it seems because they cannot be bothered to remember research suggests that in middle age at least absentmindedness is a particularly male problem at the age of womens verbal memory outperforms their male counterparts by a significant margin a report by the institute of education university of london suggests a survey of more than middleaged british men and women showed that women outscored men in two listening and recollection tests men performed significantly more poorly in the verbal memory tests particularly on the delayed memory test the authors matthew brown and brian dodgeon said this was quite a surprising result since women turning tend to do worse another study has shown that during the menopause women do not do so well participants in the first test listened to common words being read out and were then given two minutes to recall as many as possible the second test required them to list the same words about five minutes later women scored almost more than men on average in the first test and nearly more in the second women were less accurate in a third test requiring them to cross out as many ps and ws as possible in a page filled with rows of random letters they had however scanned letters faster than men in a fourth test naming as many animals as they could in a minute men and women had identical scores each could name animals on average the study did not test whether men are better than women at recalling numbers previous studies have shown that women tend to do better on word recognition tests those tested were members of the national child development study who have been tracked since their birth in they were tested at age and the latest tests will help estimate the impact that exercise diet smoking alcohol and depression have had on mental abilities initial analysis shows those who exercised at least once a month did better on all tests on average than those who did not nonsmokers including exsmokers also outscored smokers in the first of the word recall tests even after social background was taken into consideration although measuring gender differences was not the central purpose of tests the differences between men and women were interesting the authors said,2010-03,endless source

britain has not traditionally made a great fuss over international womens day but that is no indication of how well a country performs in guaranteeing equal rights between the sexes there are societies where tomorrows holiday will be celebrated with much pomp and where institutional prejudice discrimination and violence against women are routinely tolerated that is generally not the case in britain in that respect there is no doubting the transformation that has taken place in this country within two or three generations prejudices that acted as a blanket prohibition on equality have been dismantled taboos over women attending university working in certain professions working at all feminism worked but its success is only partial sufficient to trigger a backlash but not comprehensive enough to smash glass ceilings in many areas of economic and cultural life the result is a disorientation expressed in a lively debate between the generations in the new review today many young women who have benefited from battles their mothers won do not want to be defined as gender combatants at the same time many women who remember how recently mainstream culture was flagrantly oppressively sexist are alarmed by what they see as their daughters complacency much of that disorientation is born of the cult of consumerism that has grown alongside womens economic empowerment as the female workforce has grown and acquired a higher disposable income the marketplace has overtaken writers philosophers and politicians in the race to define what it means to be a successful independent modern woman often what marketing executives male or female think defines womanhood is appalling to traditional feminists it is seen as a surrender to materialism and acceptance of an ideal of the female form taken from pornography the rejoinder from marketsavvy women is that they dress and act as they do for their own pleasure not the gratification of men meanwhile the evidence suggests that the advance that made such a debate even possible has stalled women are still excluded from top jobs and paid less than their male peers one recent survey found that of board

in american journalist susan brownmiller published a book about rape called against our will i have it here beside me now and ill tell you this for nothing its not an easy read six pages in and brownmiller has already made reference to freud jung marx and engels and also to someone called krafftebing whose name is unfamiliar to me but who she says is the author of a famous study called psychopathia sexualis apparently krafftebing is good on frotteurs and fetishists but terrible on rapists she concludes her first chapter by stating that rape is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear provocative closely argued exhaustively researched against our will is now considered a feminist classic brownmiller is one of several famous feminists who appear in the first part of vanessa engles new documentary series women on bbc do not miss it to mark the th birthdays of germaine greers the female eunuch and kate milletts sexual politics engle has gone out with her camera and asked firstgeneration feminists quite a few blunt questions the result is completely delicious she asks ann oakley author of a rather serious book on housework and of the novel the mens room about the nature of her orgasms she asks brownmiller about her abortions and she asks kate millett once a time magazine cover star and now an irascible old lady in crocs who makes a living selling christmas trees if the womens movement drove her crazy it drives everyone crazy says millett lighting another cigarette naturally millett is just being mischievous because what strikes you most forcefully about these women is how very sane they are believe me when i tell you that rod liddle and co are going to hate this series the events engles interviewees describe have a certain vintage tone to them of course when a former radical anarchofeminist called lynn alderson reveals what she and the sisters used to get up to with a cannula and a specially adapted fridge motor i had to do a quick circuit of my sofa while emitting a loud squeal but mostly they sound only wise and very funny brownmiller a peachylooking yearold with a serious aerobics habit is hilarious i thought id be more popular with men she says of the publication of against our will thats what happened to men who published books they got all this attention from women cue screams of ironic laughter its been obvious for ages that engle is a brilliant filmmaker but what she has done in women feels kind of definitive and should be shown to heatreading teenage girls everywhere here it is the proof a woman can be likable funny endearing even wellpreserved and she can also be clever stern angry and argumentative if she wants she can write a seriously scary book all these things are not mutually exclusive and together make for a fulfilled and productive life blackshirts black humour nancy mitfords novel wigs on the green a satirical romance about national socialism not words you read together often is back in print hooray the book which sends up mitfords brotherinlaw oswald mosley and contains a veiled portrait of her hitlerloving sister unity was previously almost impossible to get hold of because nancy would not agree to a new edition it wasnt only that it had made her sister diana mosley livid jokes about fascism started to seem less hilarious after unity her loyalties divided when britain declared war on germany shot herself in a munich public garden wigs is not mitfords best book but it is funny and it arrives with neat timing the chris morris film four lions a comedy about rubbish jihadists will be released here in just a few weeks and will provoke a giant fuss about what we should and should not make jokes about this argument is so boring extremism is vile and destructive but that doesnt mean that it isnt also pompous nonsense into which good jokes keenly deployed may sail like poisoned arrows in the netherlands the rightwing party led by geert wilders has had a breakthrough in the countrys municipal elections no doubt the dutch will go for him with all sorts of good and reasoned arguments in the weeks

from alistair darlings warning of an economic downturn the like of which had not been seen for years to george youngs assertion that lord ashcroft is a nondom it has never been more clear that the most awful political gaffes occur when some fool acts on a ghastly impulse to speak the truth but the contagion is spreading hilary mantel is no politician but the novelists supposedly controversial statement that having sex and having babies is what young women are about and their instincts are suppressed in the interests of societys timetable is simply a statement of the obvious why mantels observations have been held up over the last few days as somehow subversive or challenging is something of a mystery how else after all can the finding of the young foundations research into recent patterns in lone motherhood be explained the foundations liberal antecedents are impeccable and the organisation certainly has no axe that it wishes to grind to a sharp point the better to swipe at single mothers with yet last month it presented findings to the centre for policy studies which strongly suggest that a greatly increasing number of women now prefer to bring up children alone on benefits instead of hanging about waiting for a breadwinner dad to hove into view see footnote looking at how parenting patterns have changed over the last years the research found that the proportion of lone mothers had risen from to no great revelation there but the research also found a significant change in the characteristics of lone motherhood over that period in the report says a lone mother had typically separated from a partner after some years of marriage or cohabitation with just describing themselves as never having lived with the father or fathers of their child or children but by the proportion had shot up to geoff dench who presented the report concluded that it seems that lone motherhood is less a result of relationship breakdown more a lifestyle choice the existence of state benefits as a source of economic security he added seems to be encouraging young mothers not to bother with male partners so as mantel reckons young women opt to dispense with the male timetable fairly readily given the option of even a basic measure of financial independence the survey found further that despite all the effort the government has made to get mothers on benefits back to work there has only been a tiny amount of progress among them while married and cohabiting mothers have increased their rates of employment over these two decades again this is interesting women are more likely to want to work and achieve some financial independence from a male partner than they are to achieve financial independence from the state this too can be viewed as a rejection to some degree of a life lived under mantels male timetable although it is also a simple confirmation that it is easier to work if a livein partner even if they are also working is around to share the childcare dench advocates that mantels male timetable should be altered in order that it fits in better with the needs of young women who want to start families by tackling male worklessness yet the trend in britain over many decades has been in the other direction the assault on heavy industry during the thatcher years quite certainly made wellpaid employment for young men more scarce however labours employment policies which kept wages low by encouraging immigration and then targeted families as the recipients of state supplements to low pay left single men out of the loop more unable than unwilling to commit to providing for a mother and their children of course its impossible to view these trends clearly unless it is through the prism of class for skilled women and men who feel fairly certain the investment of time and effort early in their careers will reap financial rewards it makes sense to start a family later even though ivf use suggests this strategy also has its pitfalls mantel goes so far as to suggest that there too women are making the wrong choice and should think more about having a family early and concentrate on a career later im not sure they are presently choosing a male timetable though it seems to me to be more of a postfeminist qualificationsbased economy timetable feminism is often criticised because it concerns itself largely with the aspirations of middleclass women ive rather come to believe this is a structural aspect of feminism it was fashioned by women who wanted to compete in the maledominated world beyond the home and thus it serves the needs of such women best denchs assertion that it is the earning ability of men that needs to be nurtured if society wishes to equip men with the ability to be good fathers runs counter to the deeply held views of many feminists because it returns so vehemently to the idea that for some people traditional gender roles are desirable yet take the state out of the equation and you dont have to be deeply conservative to believe the state is not a good alternative to a father and a startlingly regressive societal timetable can be imagined if young women want to have babies and stay at home then as the young foundations research shows they are unlikely to find a man to support them among their peers who might they turn to an older successful man who has sowed his wild oats with fellow careerists and wants to settle down with someone younger more compliant more naive more dependent that way lies the virginity cult and the familiar urge once prevalent in this country and still prevalent in many parts of the world to keep teenage boys and girls apart in case they commit the solecism of wanting to choose sexual attraction rather than domestic security farfetched of course not human societies have developed in this way over and over again and for many years in this country the challenge has been getting out from under it perhaps feminism has to come to terms with the idea that to help young women who aspire to be mothers and housewives then their young male peers should be helped to support them in doing so the old idea abhorrent to feminists was that a mans job was more important because he had a family to support even as i write that paternalism still grates but in the realm beyond the middle class dualincome career family it might be time to accept that this concept is not quite the insult to all women that it once appeared to be more equitable pay scales across socioeconomic groups are surely far more important in terms of creating a cohesive society than concentrating mainly on the stillappalling gender pay gap within professions like much else in this country the real problem is quite simply that so many people are expected to work for pay too low for a family to manage on this footnote was added on march the research referred to is by a fellow of the young foundation geoff dench but it was not a young foundation project nor the foundation says does it represent our view a published clarification on this will follow in the guardian,2010-03,alistair darling warning economic downturn like seen year george young assertion lord ashcroft

suzanne moore is assuring me earnestly that she is not and never has been a hardened drug addict we are sitting in her kitchen past the bright pink glare of her living room the skewwhiff numbers on her front door and the outer walls that are painted in wild clashing pastels her middle daughter bliss has just wandered in and out in search of toast and on hearing that this is an interview has said that all she really knows about her mothers life is she was a junkie for about years moore laughs at this we all laugh and then as bliss leaves the room moore sighs i really need a spin doctor dont i it is certainly hard to see steve hilton or alastair campbell putting up with this kind of teenage joke and yes it is a joke however well delivered but then this small corner of the general election campaign is not quite politicsasusual moore has always been a oneoff she is a leftwing journalist who moved from marxism today to the mail on sunday a feminist once lambasted by germaine greer for her big hair and fuckme shoes a single mother who has had three daughters with three different men in three different decades now she is standing as an independent candidate in the hackney north and stoke newington constituency she has lived in for just under years a decision she announced a few weeks ago in her regular mos column moore was disillusioned with the current political system like many she disagreed with the iraq war from the start was demoralised by the expenses scandal and depressed by the dearth of choices on offer and wanted to engage with democracy through diy politics is it possible to be yourself and stand for election she wrote i shall find out hackney north and stoke newington is an ultrasafe labour seat with a majority in which according to an analysis of voters power each persons ballot is worth of a vote i thought im not empowered as a voter could i be empowered as a candidate she says is she worried about being pigeonholed with that other highprofile independent candidate esther rantzen what category is that mad old woman no attentionseeking well she says the reaction is fairly split between people who think youre just a mad attentionseeking nutcase and the people who come up and say go for it but for me this is a look at whether democracy works almost going back to my old leftie and sometimes anarchist politics and saying im just gonna do it the system says you can do it but can you really her decision is on some level controversial shes contesting the seat of diane abbott who made history in by becoming the countrys first black female mp shamefully theres still only one other black woman in the commons fellow labour mp dawn butler moore has been complimentary about abbott in the past praising her advocacy for young black men for instance but was incensed by her decision to send her son to private school a move that abbott herself described as indefensible she must have thought twice about challenging such an important figure moore agrees that abbotts initial win was hugely significant but says that there is a feeling locally that abbots not here enough shes been around too long shes too tied to westminster what would moore say to the argument that on principle its wrong to stand against one of the only two black women in the commons id say thats pretty racist actually i dont think that there should be anyone in power whos considered unassailable whether theyre a man woman black white i ask moore whether she might get in and she has no illusions theres the political answer and theres the reality that this is a safe labour seat but theres no doubt that if she did win unlikely as that is shed shake up the establishment moore was born in in ipswich to a mother who was a workingclass tory and an american father her parents split up when she was a small child the yearning to escape started early she once wrote that growing up all she had ever wanted to do was leave her home town did she find it boring yeah totally conformist she attended an allgirls grammar absolutely the kind of school that everyone wants their children to go to now but horrible awful living hell totally uniform she became a very very rebellious teenager in every possible way i was good at school until i was about then hormones kicked in at she decided to leave school prompting a confused conversation with her headmistress she was told they had been lining her up to go to cambridge to which she replied she had already been she had recently attended a gig there it only dawned on her later that this was a reference to the university because no one had spoken to me about that stuff if youre not brought up in a certain way these things arent available to you and you dont even know what they mean the head mistress asked what she was going to do next i said i could be an astronaut or i could be prime minister completely insane of course i couldnt have been an astronaut i dont even like flying she moved into a bedsit at and spent the next seven years working and travelling flitting between jobs and countries i sold encyclopaedias in new orleans i was a social worker in haringey ive been a waitress ive worked in shops ive been an audiology technician learning how to do hearing tests i went around south america india and then in new york i decided to be a psychoanalyst she returned to britain embarked on a psychology degree at middlesex university and hated it psychology just seemed to be a lot of tests experiments to show that women couldnt drive that sort of thing so she switched to cultural studies marxism poststructuralism they made me question the other stuff i was being taught as a leftwing student she was involved in protests marches and other direct action people remember the s for its style and for yuppies but they forget that it was a real decade of dissent the miners strike greenham common after receiving a first for her ba she started a phd at middlesex on theories of pleasure and also began writing her first pieces of journalism i thought you could do both but people very quickly said no youve got to choose she quit the phd after months i got frustrated with the idea that you would do all this work and three people in the world were going to read it instead she landed a job editing the cultural pages of marxism today before becoming a film critic for the new statesman moore had her first child scarlet when she was at university in her mids she had bliss in her early s years later she had another daughter angel she has been a single mother pretty much throughout given her experience of having a child in three separate decades she says she probably agrees with hilary mantels recent comments that women might sometimes benefit from having children when theyre young when i had scarlet i had no money but a lot of energy and as you get older you have well luckily for me more money but less energy ive known so many people who have left it and left it and then had problems you just want everyone to be aware of the choices they have to make she has always had a feminist outlook she says formed partly as a result of seeing her mother who was in lots of ways really strong but trapped by her relationships with men financially dependent i think i decided very young that i would never be financially dependent on a guy it is a decision she has stuck to but moore didnt always call herself a feminist at first she was loth to identify with it because while i thought that as a woman i could do whatever i liked i also thought yeah but i do like lipstick after realising the two interests were compatible she became one of the most popular feminist writers in the country given her leftwing politics feminism and sometime anarchism it was a surprise when moore became a columnist for the mail on sunday following stints at the guardian and independent plenty of journalists have drifted from left to right but this isnt the case for her the political slant of her opinions hasnt changed was it a difficult decision to move to such a rightwing paper i did have to think about it she says but my stance has always been to make ideas popular to talk to people who are different from you ive always been completely straight about the fact that there were two reasons why i went one was the money and one was the idea of having such an enormous readership where i wouldnt be preaching to the converted she was also attracted to the idea that it was a readership that could decide an election and having spent years communicating political ideas on paper she is now doing the same on the streets of her constituency her local proposals include filling the many hundreds of empty council properties reviving the stoke newington festival and setting up microfinancing schemes for small businesses and having been despondent about the national choices on offer at the start of the election campaign she wrote excitedly about the rise of cleggbama in her last column i am not a lib dem but i share absolutely a sense that something has to shift and am excited to think it might she would particularly like to see more honesty in politics candidates who are recognisably human not required to have children a devoted spouse and a spotless past we now have a situation where we know that people have taken drugs but they have to say i didnt like it im not a junkie like bliss said but i can say that ive taken drugs and liked it i cant pretend otherwise the fact is that now if youre of a certain generation and you havent slept around taken drugs youre just not normal so what are we going to do do you want the people who represent you to be flawed or to embody this perfect ideal because weve had the perfect ideal and thats given us the bloody expenses scandal and two wars not everyones impressed by the honest approach out canvassing recently a man looked askance at her campaign material christ he said i might be disillusioned but itll be a

this has been a very depressing election to observe as a woman voter senior female politicians have been wholly absent from the campaign replaced by the omnipresent dutifully smiling leaders wives perhaps more disturbing is the new determination by all parties to address women primarily as mothers and carers last week labour politicians descended on a motherandbaby coffee morning in walthamstow to celebrate the unprecedented number of women candidates it is standing at the general election the prevailing theme was the issue of how much work labour has done to make life easier for mothers in turn harriet harman tessa jowell and diane abbott spoke about the policies labour has implemented that benefit women highlighting child tax credits sure start and improved childcare arrangements in the same vein labours campaign literature sets out its achievements for women pinpointing the introduction of the child trust fund free childcare for three and fouryearolds and the new childrens centres these are all achievements worth celebrating but it feels very regressive to have them packaged and presented as womens issues using female politicians to talk about childcare arrangements to women voters just perpetuates the idea that these are marginal issues of interest only to women wouldnt it be better to have the policies directed at parents rather than mothers otherwise there is an implicit restatement of the idea of women as carers and men as breadwinners who dont have time to think about childcare arrangements ceri goddard of the fawcett society says that given women are still doing twothirds of the childcare in the week and threequarters at the weekend these are still issues that disproportionately concern women but politicians could help tackle these enduring stereotypes by dragging discussion of childcare issues away from the fringes and into the mainstream given that all three leaders of the main political parties have young children and are grappling with childcare shouldnt these be issues that they discuss during the televised debates rather than consigning them as niche issues to be dealt with on the sidelines by female politicians talking to female voters polling may have identified young mothers as key voters in a number of marginal seats but talking to women exclusively as mothers doesnt feel like a step towards greater equality every mention of this being the mumsnet election underscores the unhelpful message that issues concerning children are issues for women rather than for parents generally the fawcett society hosted a debate on tuesday to rival the televised male leaders debate with three senior women politicians debating issues from the economy violence against women and the need to get more women into parliament harman labours equality minister theresa may the conservatives shadow minister for woman and the lib dems lynne featherstone had an angry debate over the tories tax relief on marriage proposal featherstone described it as totally and utterly offensive harman dismissed it as just bonkers while may insisted this was a policy that had her full support it was an enlightening evening but this was another fringe event women talking to women on the margins of the campaign with no cameras to broadcast these voices to the nation still weve had news of miriam gonzlezs broken elbow and sarah browns red shoes to redress

theres a special feeling i get when spring is in the air and my reawakened arty curiosity draws me into theatres galleries and bookshops that feeling is nausea i felt it when i saw this weeks edition of the london review of books twelve chaps and four lucky ladies have written in it the previous edition had men and three women a fortnight before that there were men and four women but on march there were eunuchs and a perfectly rendered wooden pinocchio puppet only joking it was men and four women get the picture check out the art on the underground posters currently on display on tube platforms over the last few years london underground has commissioned a series of images incorporating the underground sign dreary i know it has now grouped the different artists works together of the two posters ive seen one features men and women and the other features men and women no modern woman wants to find herself alone on a station platform counting a poster its sad but its all part of my investigation into cultural femicide the erasure of women from public life who are the perpetrators events organisers editors in broadcasting and the media radio and tv producers commissioners and jurors they are male and female they probably dont realise theyre doing it but they dont mind theyre fine with a virtually womanfree world to witness femicide in action go to the town of hay this may at the same time as the annual book festival is an unrelated philosophy festival called how the light gets in there are debates covering broad themes such as evolution the urban space creativity violence and privacy all but two of these events are maledominated eight are menonly opening with being human in the st century ha ha ha ha ha ha four white men are going to discuss all the facets of the human experience thirteen discussions have just one woman and either four or three men and one has one woman and two men one event is a screening of a guys film two talks have two men and two women and thats it i was scheduled to attend and was hugely relieved when other obligations meant i had to drop out i know from experience that female participation in events that massively underrepresent women does not change anything year on year the ratio stays the same how the light gets in gives different men the opportunity to speak it offers the same opportunity to just women alongside the talks are evening events featuring a wellchosen and original roster of musicians djs and comedians the gender balance here is markedly better did two different people organise these two sides of the festival perhaps women are considered fine as light entertainment but unnecessary when it comes to the serious stuff we no longer live in an age where female thinkers writers philosophers academics artists theorists activists or politicians are rare the discrimination is obvious all you have to do is count its all the more galling given that women equal or outnumber men as attendees of arts festivals concerts readings discussions and debates and as arts and humanities students at university women write read edit and publicise more fiction than men women make up the majority of executive pr and organisational staff in arts and cultural institutions womens ticket revenue licence fees book purchases and entrance fees are being used to fund events at which women artists and thinkers are marginalised with breathtaking obviousness feeling sick yet wait this summer the serpentine gallery celebrates its th pavilion commission to be designed by jean nouvel in years only one solo woman architect zaha hadid has sketched the serpentines garden tent curator julia peytonjones commented in a documentary about sexism in art that she didnt curate womenonly shows because i dont think it serves women she should know all about not serving women the serpentines poetry marathon talks last year gave us men and women as did its manifesto marathon the previous year in and the event gave us men and women both times when discriminators are challenged they produce snivelling fudges and sideswipes ceri thomas editor of today denies that sexism is behind the programme having one woman out of five presenters and one woman out of every contributors what is it then the whim of the gods i used to power my way through every tokenwoman appearance on panels in the hope that the shining example of my contribution would change the paradigm through sheer force of presence it didnt happen ten years ago i went on a british council reading tour to germany i was the only woman out of four this spring the british council sent a group of british writers to tour india six men one woman i left a highprofile arts magazine programme because on show after show month after month we averaged five or six men and one or two women on several shows there were no women my triumph was one edition featuring major interviews with tracey emin and theatre director marianne elliott speaking of the theatre dont go there literally march to june at the national features works written by men and since tamsin oglesbys really old like fortyfive finished on tuesday none by women theres one woman director and thats elliott if you want to be in conversation with a british actor you can choose from four chaps or fiona shaw in the book shops biography section manworshipping volumes outnumber feminine fancies by roughly to one when i went the only prominently displayed womans book was antonia frasers memoir about how much she worships a man her late husband harold pinter its called must you go must he go where must he go philandering or must he go on writing sexist plays want to bury your head in a more exotic tome ooh no the international prize for arabic fiction has given us shortlists of five books by men and one by a woman in all three years of its existence the juries have had one woman and three four or five men think its down to arab conservatism hey dont be so quick to throw stones whitey in years of the booker prize the jury has been maledominated times there have been male winners and female winners that said the one time there were four women and one man on the jury in they chose kingsley amiss the old devils over margaret atwoods the handmaids tale god why do women love misogynists so much is it stockholm syndrome let me peruse something lighter such as the sunday papers but research by jane mackenzie in the january to march issue of mslexia magazine demonstrated that the coverage of books in the literary pages of the broadsheets overwhelmingly underrepresented women and lionised men when i sceptically did some adding myself with the sunday times i realised theyd reviewed books by men and one by a woman yet every day at work i receive packages in which womens books outnumber those by men and all look intriguing enough to cover somehow a decision is being made probably subconsciously about what is worthwhile and what is worthless when i was judging the orange prize last year we all noticed how major bookshops consistently stacked mens books to every one womans book on its recommended read tables in whatever genre in one bookshop fellow judge martha lane fox was told barefacedly by the sales guy that this was because men published times as much fiction as women but as everyone knows chaps are heavyweight colossal conceptual geniuses of quite massive greatness and literary ladies are clever little fairies handstitching our charmingly personal tiny tales out of skirtingboard dust and featherweight neuroses so whats the solution the establishment patriarchy the mainstream whatever you want to call it just doesnt find women interesting it makes sure that women are heavily outnumbered from the very beginning by offering us only a fraction of available opportunities slots placements commissions trips panel places star jobs reviews later it conveniently uses this to claim that there are not enough women out there to make a stronger impression higher up it talks down womens work it is supported by a false mythology about the weakness inconsistency subjectivity and inconsequentiality of womens creation experience and perspective i can no longer give my time and attention and implicitly my support to any event such as the debates at how the light gets in that gives space to five times as many men as women id rather use my power to fight for womens voices to be heard our talent to be celebrated our participation in the world represented accurately our intellect respected and our expertise honoured it does not matter what sexist men or apolitical women think about this the solution to discrimination is female solidarity and the deliberate concentration of womens power but first i need some

the increasingly presidential style of the uk general election campaign has edged senior women politicians out of the forefront of the political debate shifting focus instead on to the wives of the three party leaders a number of prominent female labour mps conceded today women in all three main parties have been at the margins of the political campaign with greater attention paid to the activities and outfits of the leaders spouses than to the roles played by senior women politicians in a shift described as a significant regression by campaigners for improved representation of women in parliament the shift in focus has been exacerbated by the increasing prominence that the leaders debates are playing in the campaign concentrating attention on the three male party leaders rather than a wider spectrum of politicians and triggering an intensified interest in the supporting role played by their partners as we watch this election it is clear that women politicians are markedly absent we have a lot of wives but not many women mps said kat banyard cofounder of uk feminista and author of the equality illusion a recent study of modern feminism all the main players are white men the lack of female role models is really stark ceri goddard chief executive of the fawcett society which campaigns for greater equality between men and women said there is still a woeful lack of senior representation of women in politics and that is reflected in the election campaign at an event yesterdaythis morning to celebrate the record number of women standing as labour candidates tessa jowell cabinet office minister acknowledged that traditional aspects of the campaign such as press conferences had been supplanted by the leaders debates shifting more attention to the male leaders but she stressed that she and other women politicians still feel at the forefront of the campaign this is the most activistled grassrootsled campaign that i have worked on largely driven by the internet women mps are all over the country getting votes harriet harman deputy leader of the labour party said politics has always been maledominated thats why we have much more work to do there is a growing celebrity culture in this country said joan ruddock an undersecretary in the department of energy and climate change it is inevitable that the leaders families are more prominent than a decade ago the obama election has played into that as well defending the partys record harman said labour had attracted many more women into parliament than the other two main parties with three times more female mps in the last parliament than all other parties put together women mps compared with for the conservatives and nine for the lib dems in seats where labour mps are retiring of labour candidates are women diane abbott labour mp for hackney north and stoke newington said that when she first stood as a candidate in many people didnt believe that i could win because the notion of an mp was of a middleaged white guy in a suit things really have moved on if you raised subjects like worklife balance or childcare years ago people would say but thats not really politics now the party leaders are all talking about it things have progressed perhaps not as much as i would have liked but they have progressed jowell argued that the number of policies benefiting women and children during labours administration was a reflection of the increased representation of women citing sure start better childcare facilities and child tax credits campaigners such as goddard believe the way politicians have tried to appeal to female voters marks a regression there is a focus on women as mothers and only mothers particularly as the polling is showing that middleclass mothers are a key voting group and all three parties are targeting them this has had the unfortunate knockon effect that much of the coverage of women in the campaign has been about women as mothers the conservative partys drive to alter the maledominated profile of its shadow cabinet has failed according to a poll published in the financial times this week in which most people questioned could not name a single female tory mp theresa may shadow work and pensions secretary is a lone female figure in the conservative campaign but party officials point out that a third of its candidates are women most in winnable seats if the conservatives have a majority of one we will have female mps in parliament may said yesterday however i realise we need to continue the process of getting more women involved in politics banyard is despondent about the proportion of women mps there was massive progress in when we saw the number of women mps doubling but that has ground to a halt and we only have six more women mps today than we did in she said we have slipped to rd place in the world league table for womens representation as mps,2010-04,increasingly presidential style uk general election campaign ha

wealthy families in britain are a third less likely to have a disabled child a statistic that reveals an alarming social gradient because those families with such children are pushed further into poverty by the pressures of caring for them according to new research despite years of legislation attempting to ease the burden on affected families disability among uk children decreases with social standing now the highest prevalence of childhood disability is found in poorest families academics at warwick university found in the paper published in the journal bmc pediatrics researchers found that households with a disabled child were a week worse off than those without this is despite the fact that the extra costs of bringing up a disabled child means families need an extra in income nationally this heavy burden weighs on the families identified in the paper as having disabled children we think the official figures underestimates the actual numbers by and the huge inequalities that the paper clearly shows that is of some concern said clare blackburn of warwick universitys school of health and social studies what is remarkable is the extent to which disability appears to be not simply just an accident of birth she said but a confluence of intergenerational poverty and modern medical progress blackburn said that the exact extent to which factors such as low income precede or follow disability is difficult to tell but what we know is that poor diet and stressful living conditions do increase the chances of premature birth and low birth weight which are indicators of future disability thanks to science these babies live longer and medicine now keeps alive disabled children who may have died years ago the warwick researchers point out that debt was more common in those families with disabled children the parents were unable to keep up with their council tax water rates and telephone bills and they were not likely to be able to afford basic items such as a family holiday once a year a bicycle or even two pairs of shoes it is a serious social gradient disabled families face said blackburn a disabled baby needs more nappies families ability to work grows difficult and finding childcare is a real burden households with disabled children will depend more on social security benefits and are faced with the additional financial costs associated with caring for a disabled child doctors said that andrew lomaxs sevenyearold daughter emily would not make it out of hospital aged two weeks born healthy she stopped breathing as a tiny baby those minutes without oxygen had left her with a severe form of cerebral palsy she was registered blind unable to swallow walk and breathe without an aspirator so her two parents gave up their jobs to look after her and their two other children our income is a year about a third of what it was before said andrew its all benefits and i am a proud man who does not like to say it but family holidays come from the kindness of charities andrew says that he cannot afford to buy his elder son the nintendo he craves he is left scouring local papers for presents his income is eaten up by fuel and petrol bills we have to keep the house very warm for emily who is susceptible to pneumonia and the cost of running the specially designed car is prohibitive it only does miles per gallon most months we are hit by bank charges and missed payments i try to juggle but it is robbing peter to pay paul charities say that the disabled have lost out to other groups seen as more deserving despite the disabled being in greatest need jonathan welfare chief executive of elizabeth finn care a poverty charity said that the disabled have had their benefits cut while pensioners had been wooed with allowances by denying the disabled the winter fuel allowance the government has left disabled people out in the cold disabled children living in poverty are often housebound due to the nature of their condition and for those with the most severe disabilities a warm home can truly be the difference between life and death this article was amended on thursday april the first paragraph of this article was amended to

if youre a parent you may consider your place of work the one remaining childfree zone a little oasis away from family life where you can enjoy some adult conversation but one day a year it may be worth throwing all that out of the window and taking your children to work on thursday instead of waving goodbye to their sons and daughters as they leave for work parents across the us will be taking them along as part of an annual take our daughters and sons to work day the event which was originally just for girls is now aimed at all eight to yearolds the point according to the official website is to show children the value of their education helping them discover the power and possibilities associated with a balanced work and family life and providing them an opportunity to share how they envision the future and begin steps toward their end goals it also lets them see what a key figure in their life spends his or her day doing there is no such formal programme in the uk but some companies and organisations hold events or have policies for parents who want to bring in their children on a day of their choosing several health authorities for example have guidelines for employees who want to treat their offspring to a day at the coalface these include salisbury nhs trust where a spokesman says the scheme is available to all staff at north hertfordshire college which allows parents to bring in their children for oneoff days heather sanderson head of jobs careers and enrichment says doing so can break down barriers for young people and help them later in life when they have interviews to attend i work with a lot of yearolds who have no experience of life outside the classroom i think the younger you can show them what it is like in the workplace the better it is for them earlier this month the price comparison website confusedcom hosted its third bring your child to work day for its employees the companys hr director elaine smith says that for children it was a good opportunity to see what their parents did and to meet their colleagues it also took the mystery out of what goes on every day she adds as a company we like to get to know our staff and this extends beyond the workplace bring the kids to the office allowed us to see a different aspect of our staffs personalities and it helps develop relationships between staff which perhaps leads to friendships outside the office victoria leyton who has helped out with the confused event in the past says she can still remember being taken into the it firm where her dad worked when she was younger it was a really great day i got to meet all my dads colleagues and probably for a nineyearold it was the best example of what goes on in a workplace on a typical day up until that point it had been a bit of a mystery and all i really knew was that it involved computers and wearing a tie victorias dad david says the company he worked for was very accommodating about him taking in his daughter colleagues were very helpful in trying to keep it interesting victoria made a very big impression on everyone i felt that she learned something about work in the it sector and particularly my part in it and victoria says the experience did have an impact on her when it came to choosing a career it definitely motivated me to work towards getting into a role that would make me enjoy going to work i got the impression that my dads job was never a means to an end mike emmott of the chartered institute of personnel and development doesnt see much value in big events pointing out that having lots of children in the office at once doesnt really give a true picture of working life and he suggests some children could be embarrassed at the thought of spending the day with a parent but he says there could be some advantages for employers i can see it doing something towards building social capital it could do something towards encouraging team building employers who are considering planning a day should says emmott think carefully about what they are trying to get out of it before they start once that is established smith has some pointers for how they can make it a success she recommends planning lots of events in advance and making sure there is flexibility so children can move around when they get bored she adds be prepared for noise and disruption throughout the office as it will not be contained get as many helpers as you can and allow them freedom to run events and of course different work environments will need their own house rules unsurprisingly salisbury nhs trust bans

every so often a single event illuminates a much wider question promoting the relationship between mothers their children and their work has been at the centre of much of the good that labour has done in the past years it has contributed to a whole new emphasis on families and parenting and it is slowly raising old questions in new contexts among the hardest to answer it might be called the alan sugar question is whether now that the equalities act absolutely enshrines their right to try there are jobs that make such demands in terms of mobility and flexibility that young mothers cannot do them it was the default response in some quarters to the case of tilern debique the young single mother from st vincent in the caribbean is expected to collect a large payout from the army after her commanding officer told her she had joined a warfighting machine and had to be available for duty day and night ms debiques case is complicated by other factors the detail does not match the headline and the tribunal was clear and its opinion was upheld on appeal that the army was wrong not to have done more to help her solve her childcare problem with the proportion of women serving in the armed forces rapidly increasing ministry of defence lawyers are no doubt already puzzling over how to deal with the childcare problems it raises what may not have occurred to them is how many other reasons there are for thinking about it parenting is both taken more seriously than it once was and shared more equally one recent survey claimed that the number of fathers who describe themselves as the main carer has risen tenfold in the past years to more than if there are jobs that young mothers should not do then increasingly young fathers will not care much for them either there is a third reason for employers more generally to think hard about what their workers need in the foreseeable future more of us will be caring for elderly parents than for young children some will have responsibilities for both indeed some already do ageing can be like adolescence in reverse it gets worse not easier the delicate balance between employee employer and state that has developed on labours watch will need more complex engineering than anything that has challenged it so far and while individual men and women balance the need to work with finding the hours they need at a wage that will support them and their families all employers are going to have to get used to accommodating the demand for flexible working and whatever its politics the state will have to step up its obligation to uphold labours

before it all kicked off we were told that this was going to be a mumsnet election named after the parenting website whose users are principally affluent aspirational women in their s and s concerned with quality of life issues they are the worcester women for our times since many other names have been coined for the same group of women in labour focused on the school gate mum last year the conservatives said they would woo holby city woman more recently douglas alexander referred to take a break woman these groups are all made up they only matter because the parties and journalists think they matter but they do say a lot about which voters the parties think are important and who is not alexanders invocation of take a break woman is interesting then because he got it so wrong those who read take a break are not the affluent women whose votes he is chasing they are women who have always been ignored by britains political class i was commissioned by a drinks company whose name will soon become obvious to write a report on the politics of women in their s and early s in the social groups c and d many of whom work in parttime jobs all of whom are on below average incomes and a significant number of whom have to juggle their work with caring for young children when asked in a survey that accompanied the writing of the report what were the biggest issues affecting their everyday lives the top answer at was money worries we called them the lambrini ladies these women are among the most disengaged from formal politics that is not news young women on lower incomes have always failed to connect their everyday lives with westminster but they are disengaged not because they are stupid or obsessed with soap operas it is because the parties have never engaged with them as our report and other surveys suggest their votes are consequently up for grabs faced with hobsons choice few have made up their minds but the parties are not talking about them even in a campaign that looks like it will lead to a hung parliament why many live in the wrong constituencies safe labour seats although how safe some of those are now is questionable we estimate however that there are about million lambrini ladies so they are everywhere even in the marginals of course their very disengagement plays against them the parties only talk to those who they think will vote they also want things that no one is offering when asked what they would do if they were prime minister for a day their top answers were free dental care cleaner hospitals and free prescriptions they are also concerned about the quality of their childrens education and many live on council estates antisocial behaviour what these women do not want is politics as soap opera pictures of david cameron holding a baby will not wash they know what small children look like simpering leaders wives cut little ice making speeches outside morrisons wont do much either it is also unclear what appeal the conservatives mooted marriage bonus might have for this group the mean age for brides is now over meaning many are not even married while women in their late s are actually the most likely age group to divorce while every little helps what amounts to a week would seem a weak inducement to tie the knot or stay together in misery those intending to vote are however motivated by serious reasons although many of them negative it seems that at present it is mostly dislike of labour the conservatives and even the liberal democrats that will get many lambrini ladies into the polling booth at the

the number of fathers in the uk staying at home to look after their children has risen times in the past years this was the headline figure from research unveiled last week by aviva an insurance company which found that about of fathers equivalent to men now consider themselves to be their childs primary carer there were other interesting snippets thrown up in the figures of couples said they now shared childcare responsibilities equally while in of households with children one parent had reduced their working hours or given up work to look after their offspring a third said they had done so because of the cost of childcare the figures suggest there has been a dramatic jump in the number of stayathome fathers in recent years just four years ago a similar mapping exercise by homedadorguk suggested there were only stayathomefathers in the uk experts however offer a note of caution the notion that there has been an upsurge of stayathome primary carer fathers does not fit with our understanding at the family and parenting institute said helen barrett senior research fellow at the institute we would recommend further investigation to check both how reliable these findings are and how valid the conclusions may be what both surveys really highlight is the difficulty in gauging the true picture as gary northeast spokesman for the homedad website explains nobody has any real idea of the true number its almost impossible to come up with anything accurate he added it need not be so the government could tweak the census to shine light on this murky area when the census goes round there is a specific question asking women do you stay at home to look after children northeast said but there is no such question for men a more complex and interesting question though is what is a stayathomedad the generic phrase masks a multitude of motivations northeast who combines looking after his children with working from home an increasingly popular option for many men who nevertheless are not recognised as stayathomedads suggests that if there really are of them out there now they will have different reasons for having arrived at their decision we have members who have been home dads for a while and then go back to work weve got some who work parttime we have men whose relationship has broken up and have custody of the children others who are at home because of the death or illness of a partner he said northeast concedes however that the majority of his organisations members have opted to give up their day jobs because their partners earn more than them the aviva survey found the woman is the main breadwinner in of families with dependent children while both roles are equally valuable nowadays its quite likely that women will be heading off to the office while men are changing nappies and doing the school run a spokeswoman for the insurer said even the sceptical family and parenting institute accepts there is truth in this premise there certainly has been change in recent years in relation to the roles of mothers and fathers in the workplace barrett said more mothers of young children are at work while there has been a rise in the numbers of fathers at home but for most parents these changes have not led to roleswapping rather where fathers have become more involved the pattern is of more shared care ie both parents see themselves as primary carers the new setup is not however without tension many women who are the main earner find the role reversal difficult with in the aviva survey saying they felt guilty about leaving their children while admitted they occasionally resented the fact that their partner did not work and what do men feel theres still a fear among some dads about staying at home northeast said they have this macho idea of what a dad should be someone who brings home the bacon they are afraid they will be thought of as effeminate northeast said he believed that this fear was declining part of this may be down to a cultural shift the equality agenda has levelled the playing field to some extent men no longer feel they have to be the breadwinner however this shift is not uniform there are still geographic redoubts where the athome father is an alien for both social and economic reasons in many parts of the country traditional views on who should be the breadwinner are still very much the norm barrett said moreover a lot of parents are finding it difficult to balance the demands of work and family more flexible work options from employers and more government support to both employers and parents would give families greater choice this argument has been recognised by the government which from next april if it is still in power will introduce new rights for fathers to take up to six months paternity leave three of which will be paid at the same rate as statutory maternity leave the time off can be taken during the second half of a babys first year if the mother returns to the workplace at the moment mothers can take nine months paid maternity leave and a further three months unpaid the new scheme will mean that if mothers return to work after six months fathers can take the following six months as paternity leave half of which will be paid the government has conceded that takeup is likely to be low with less than one in fathers expected to leave work for a period of fulltime childcare but the real importance of the new legislation may be more in its symbolism something that helps shape the uks values for years to come it is a further nail in the coffin of those who do not recognise the athome father however many of them are out there two things are clear they are growing and they are largely happy you will never have a better or more meaningful job

i sometimes wonder why we go to all the expense and bother of educating women the gcses the alevels the degrees the years spent attempting to establish a career and for what when as evidenced last week to play a meaningful part in britains democratic process in the only qualification a woman truly requires is a level nvq in applying makeup and a short primer in how to accessorise ones handbag with ones shoes because yes it has come to this a century of struggle a suffragette or two under a horse the odd hunger strike years or so of the sex discrimination act and three weeks before the election the great debate lighting up the tabloids the broadsheets the fashion pages and the news at ten is the war of the wives samcam davids secret weapon takes on sarah brown the first lady of twitter if youve had the good fortune to miss the coverage allow me to summarise samantha cameron looks good in trousers sarah in skirts both women confine themselves to exchanging pleasantries while their aides reveal where they bought their outfits yes i know its impossibly exciting and yet this is where female representation in politics currently stands harriet harman theresa may the most senior women in the labour and conservative parties respectively so where are they exactly not in the news bulletins thats for sure or in any newspaper which raises the question of why anyone would bother spending years slogging away anonymously in parliamentary committee meetings and at interminable constituency dinners when your time could have been far better spent designing handbags and engaging in a spot of light charity work if only theyd had the foresight to marry the right men what the election has made plain is a fact already well known to tana ramsay coleen rooney and jane austen if youre a woman who wants power marry a powerful man the most influential women in british politics are both entirely unelected not unlike roza otunbayeva the new leader of kyrgyzstan only her particular promotion took the form of an armed insurrection which in the circumstances doesnt seem like such a bad idea in all honesty which would you prefer five minutes in the houses of parliament with a kalashnikov or to be trussed up in jeans and heels as the conservative female candidates were last week hustled under the lights of a photographic studio and pictured in the various newspapers beneath the headlines camerons cuties and daves dolls blairs babes camerons cuties these women arent politicians in the sense of possessing political power theyre window dressing just as samantha cameron and sarah brown and even miriam gonzlez durntez adorn their men all this fluff this tittletattle this pointless detail about samcams wardrobe and sarbros shoes is an embodiment of the idea that a woman is accoutrement of the man she marries his trophy his prize none of this is politics the war of the wives the battle of the spouses the indepth reports on news at ten about the samcam effect and the questions at gordon browns news conference on the sarah brown strategy its evolutionary biology with all the sophistication and subtlety of a troop of chimpanzees sniffing each others bottoms how do you establish dominance in a chimp pack pant hoot scream rough up your rivals and impregnate the most attractive females you can is this what we want too to choose our next prime minister on the basis of who has the prettiest wife or of who has most recently managed to get her up the duff we are higher primates with large frontal lobes capable of complex thought we can evaluate policies and assess strategies or we can carry on the way we are by judging women on how they look and men on who they mate david cameron the new prime ministerinchimp bart becht grew rich on our stupidity and so a warm round of applause for bart becht the chief executive who last week took home a pay packet of m how cheering it is that even in these straitened times its still possible to make gazillions of money out of us the people too stupid to know any better mr becht works for reckitt benckiser a company that as even he has pointed out in the past makes some very stupid products and yet dumb as they are and this is the company that gave the world cillit bang we have been proven to be even dumber its not just that cillit bang is routinely voted the least popular brand in britain and yet still flies off the shelves or even that it contains the kind of chemicals considered handy for cleaning up plutonium stains a discovery workers at dounreay nuclear power station made last year its that there are few finer examples of how capitalism works than the reckitt benckiser model make something people dont really need charge them a lot of money for it then and this is the truly brilliant twist change the name slightly and put the price up i give you finish quantumatic or what always used to be called detergent and nurofen express liquid capsules which we pedants call ibruprofen except that a packet of tesco ibruprofen costs p and nurofen express capsules costs id really like to say that anyone who is stupid enough to buy nurofen deserves to be out of pocket and bart becht to be paid m a year but its been clinically proved that if you believe nurofen is better than ibruprofen it will work better on you dammit its a refinement of the placebo effect so brilliant its positively bechtian when even our headaches obey the implacable logic of the market what chance do we have nurofen the analgesic of the masses as marx never said give me aintrees funlovers over ascots ladies ladies lay down your mascara wands and step away from that floral dress or do so in the full knowledge that a national newspaper photographer may take a photo of you print it and hold you up as an object of ridicule and contempt last week saw the national annual lampoon a liverpudlian event otherwise known as ladies day at aintree or as the headline in the mail put it

its ordinary people too young girls whose only crime is to put on a frock on a sunny spring day or as one article put it the worst offenders basked in the spring sunshine sporting acid neons

chloe angyal is correct when she asserts that most young american women believe in equal rights however for some women eschewing the label of feminist is not about avoiding being called ugly or an angry extremist for some women avoiding the label of feminist comes from a place of selflove and balance feminism is the form of womens organisation that is prioritised both in the media and academia but many black women have turned to womanism in an attempt to counter the ways in which the combined oppressions of race and gender affect our lives womanism is not just feminism for women from minorities it is based in our spirituality honouring our foremothers and a desire to support both men and women while womanism at its heart is prowoman it is also about understanding the communal value of all people of colour im not a feminist and there is no but because my life experiences lead me to believe that feminism was not created for women like me the name of the first feminist hero mentioned by my professor in my first womens study lecture was simone de beauvoir and the trend of focusing on white women would continue throughout my education inclusivity to the womens studies department that i was a part of meant using the work of bell hooks occasionally however she quickly became an additive thrown in to give the appearance of intersectionality i would have to scour the library and online journals to learn names like patriciahill collins audre lorde and the woman who would become my inspiration alice walker and so i followed indexes and bibliographies desperate to read journeys that mirrored my own i sat in seminars where i became the token black woman when they deemed it necessary to actually consider something outside of the white woman as monolithic representative despite feminism supposedly being a movement to end womens oppression womens studies seminars and lectures are where i learned to recite aint i a woman out loud to protest the assumptions about my race and my culture it is where i learned that the sisterhood and camaraderie lasts only as long as you dont insist on interrogating oppression from multiple sites just as the primary and high school education system includes black history month as an additive in a faux attempt at inclusivity so too are the works of black women occasionally intermingled within womens studies curriculum including the works of black women occasionally in a womens studies program is not inclusive it simply mirrors all of the previous modes of pedagogy that marginalises students of colour while reifying white hegemony in fact the very existence of separate classes dealing with the works of black women indigenous women and latina women signify a failure to fully integrate the work of women of colour in all academic endeavours despite protestations the ghettoisation of the work of women of colour too often frames white womanhood as the monolithic norm today feminism has moved out of the academy the conversations that occur in the feminist blogosphere serve as modernday consciousness raising sessions as they formulate new theory and supposedly make room for voices that have previously been silenced the internet has been constructed as the great equaliser yet blogs which are largely run by white women like feministe feministing pandagon and bitch phd dominate the blogosphere thus replicating the very same hierarchy that academia has been perpetuating for a very long time blogs run by traditionally marginalised women do not attract the same attention by the media when feminists are pulled from the internet for interviews it is routinely the same white feminist voices representing the broad perspectives that are visible on the internet unlike academia where the power dynamic between professor and student does not allow for radical confrontation marginalised women have forcefully made themselves heard through a series of boycotts as well as critical essays confronting feminists of privilege regarding race ableism and transphobia despite repeated calls for change the dynamics remains the same because the powerful blogs maintain the ability to silence and effectively ignore the critique of marginalised women simply based in size and clout though the different strata of womens organising often finds itself fighting the same issues differences in race class ability and cisgender status continue to divide activism making it impossible for real ally work to occur how can you claim the label of those who would oppress you to see their goals realised even when commonality exists in some areas not owning the feminist label is not always about equivocation for some women it represents truly loving oneself in the face of bigotry,2010-04,chloe angyal correct asserts young american woman believe equal right however woman eschewing label feminist avoiding called ugly angry extremist woman avoiding label feminist come

if you were to ask most young american women if they believe in equal rights for women the answer would no doubt be a resounding yes when it comes to voting or being able to get an education women of my generation are in little doubt as to our rights when it comes to injustice against women abroad from acid attacks and female genital mutilation we are similarly unconflicted the young women of my generation are driven and outspoken we start blogs and play on athletic teams and run student theatre companies we are more likely to graduate from high school and college than the boys in our cohort and we enter professional and graduate school at a comparable rate too we look forward to full and busy lives made possible in part by the progress made by our mothers and grandmothers we are heirs to a legacy built by the womens libbers who came before us and the suffragettes who came before them and yet if you ask the average young american woman if she is a feminist the answer isnt often a resounding yes the answer is usually im not a feminist but what follows will be the profession of a feminist view like her belief in equal pay for equal work or in a womans right to choose but she will add this doesnt make her a feminist in an age when feminist beliefs are almost a given for young women the word feminist has become quite the opposite and many are shunning the label its hardly surprising after all feminism has a pretty dreadful reputation in her landmark book backlash susan faludi painstakingly chronicled over a century of scare tactics designed to deter women from embracing the ideas of feminism fortunately those tactics were ultimately unsuccessful most women of my generation embrace feminist ideas what the backlash has succeeded in doing is making feminists and the idea of being a feminist unappealing faludis book was written in but almost years later too little has changed in the popular imagination feminists are still the ugly angry extremists who killed chivalry and who seek not gender equality but world domination calling yourself a feminist carries with it the risk of having any one of these labels slapped on your forehead its also unsurprising that women of my generation feel that the feminist movement hasnt made room for them for a long time it didnt but thankfully feminism has now recognised that young womens voices matter and that young womens leadership is valuable the website that i write for feministing is devoted to giving young feminist women a platform and its not the only one there are thousands of young women out there who proudly wear that label and im grateful every day for the hard work that they do none of them would deny that being a feminist is hard work feminism demands a complete overhaul of how we think how we behave how we talk where we work what media we consume how we vote and how we raise our families for women and for men feminism is a dramatic shift away from the way things have always been thats why its so thrilling and so threatening unfortunately despite the enormous strides we have made towards gender equality that overhaul is far from complete in a country where only of congress is female where women with or without children make what men make a decade after finishing their education and where only of rapists will serve jail time we cant afford not a feminist but a disclaimer that signals to the world that were willing to settle for an incomplete overhaul im not a feminist but is a way of telling the world that we dont pose too much of a threat its a way of saying that we dont plan to rock the boat too much that we will play nice and yet feminists are people who dare to imagine a world in which women are of congress where women are paid of what their male colleagues earn and where every person who violates another human being is reported prosecuted and convicted its tempting to hide behind this disclaimer this shield but it is feminism which got us where we are today and without action and leadership from unabashed young feminists we wont get much further so step out from behind your shield and say it i am a feminist no ifs ands or buts this article was commissioned after the author contacted us via a you tell us thread if you would like to propose your own subjects for cif to cover please visit the latest thread,2010-04,ask young american woman believe equal right woman answer would doubt resounding yes come voting able get education woman generation little doubt right come injustice woman abroad acid attack female genital

poor ceri thomas verily he squirmeth watching him wriggle makes me feel like a strapping schoolyard brawler poking a weeny worm with a stick is it the worm of discrimination being poked by the stick of justice hmm you can see why my prose never made book at bedtime anyway i write in a spirit of absolution thomas is a victim of circumstance he happens through a stroke of bad luck which must agonise him to manage a show which has one woman presenter out of five and woman contributors out of a hundred it makes me sad but it makes me happy that hes working on it let queen b help to get more women on your show you need to invite more invite half since that is a fair representation of us in the population defenders of the status quo speak as though this is a difficult procedure

communication and uranus planet of sudden change to be in alignment with aries sign of energy equality happens when the participants in a team value it and act on it i currently present the strand for the world service we have total sexual equality and a cultural diversity which make me want to kiss the marble steps of bush house in tribute every time i go to work weve achieved this by facilitating it same goes for front row various beeb radio arts shows and the few documentaries ive been privileged to work on the same goes for countless producers ive met it is endorsement from the top the editors and execs that is needed thomas talks defensively about the reemergence of bullheaded sexism as though this is what today has been accused of it isnt bullheaded sexism is easy to fight because of its blatancy far more pernicious is an unconscious and generalised misogyny which is prevalent in organisations and industries of all kinds the public absence of women is enforced automatically and attempts to change are resisted with spurious arguments fuelled by basic unwillingness it makes no difference whether the perpetrators are male or female if they have no politics they will not do anything to challenge the status quo additionally women in these organisations are in a tricky position if you speak up you jeopardise your position should thomas be feeling unconfident in the face of all this let me urge him to valour if he employs so very few women in such a very obvious way on such an important show he is seeming to hint that he does not like women if he did he would be able to stomach more than one at a time it must torment him to be misrepresented like this so no doubt any changes will be dramatic and happen swiftly we women are the single biggest group in the world ceri

women struggling in lowerincome families are turning away from the labour party in a swing that could cost gordon brown the election in a survey by the countrys largest parenting website for the observer mothers across britain reported that they would be looking to david cameron to change things for them with the tories holding a point lead over labour though the majority didnt agree with the conservatives key policies on family values in the netmums poll some mothers of young and schoolage children were asked what way they voted in and what way they would vote this may the results saw saying they intended to vote tory compared with last time who intended to vote labour down from and for the liberal democrats up from in with voting for other parties and not intending to vote with the closest election since looming all three main parties and their strategists believe securing the votes of women especially mothers could give them the edge in the way that suburban soccer moms in the us were seen as playing a vital role in the reelection of bill clinton as president in but the results from the netmums survey show that all politicians still have a lot to do in reaching britains eight million mothers of young and schoolage children as the majority of women responding to this survey said they believed that none of the political parties was communicating its policies effectively netmums has million visits every month with an average of mothers logging on to the site every day and its demographic is wider than the middleclass women that the parties have been trying to reach out to the tories with their promise to reward marriage with tax breaks and labour with promises to make it easier for mothers to get back into work about of netmums users come from lowerincome social groups both parties ideas seemed to be scoring badly with the mothers in this survey however far more said they thought the conservatives were wrong to try to elevate married couples above unmarried ones with only seeing the proposed tax breaks as a good idea while an overwhelming majority didnt think marital status had any effect on the quality of parenting and most mothers were having to go back to work after the birth of their children just to keep the wolf from the door the sites cofounder siobhan freegard says that many of the mothers who use it are deeply unhappy about having to go back to work when their children are small we have a lot of women just so distressed at having to leave young children to go and work really just to make ends meet they just want to be with their babies she said around of the women who replied to this survey are in households with incomes of or less people really struggling to support themselves and so many commentators

thank you ceri thomas in saying that women are not up to presenting the today programme you brightened my day open sexism always makes me giggle what astonishes me is that women feel outraged when boys club mascots say these things we should thank them for making their dislike so explicit men have been slandering women for centuries as a means of justifying their oppression against us the assertion that any environment is too tough for women who are weak is a longstanding lie it has been said at some point about every single area of public life including laughably professional kitchens women should not waste time explaining patiently how we can after all present today presenting a politics show on the radio is not the same as actually working in politics crafting legislation debating in the commons or campaigning to highlight say domestic violence rape and sexual abuse its a media job presenting is presenting and its not that difficult all the female producers i have ever worked with know and joke about how today is a nasty boys club that they have one token woman guest and that while they pretend to cover all current affairs they do not do so if those affairs are about women on other shows after conducting a successful interview with a famously recalcitrant artist i was told by a male boss good girl a network head sneered after i praised the brilliant sarah dunants novel sacred hearts if you want menstruating nuns go to her thats all she does i saw the sixweek schedule for an arts show in the office one day three different men and one woman per week covered items of which only three were by women artists ive sat in on meetings where female guests have been called cows bitches in the case of an item that was delayed because the guest had been caught up in a riot in sierra leone and quirky but certifiable presenting the today programme is nothing compared to surviving in a world that hates women misogyny doesnt just come in the form of a violent attacker slaying us on the street it can be found talking and smiling in a seemingly civilised way wearing a suit at the top of powerful institutions everywhere this is how patriarchy was created and maintained patriarchy is the fancy name for the boys club the club is longstanding because its members share the desire to exclude women and will happily voice any vicious lie to do so ceri thomas is making it clear to any woman interested in working on today that she is in hostile territory and that her colleagues will greet her with an assumption of her inferiority they will close ranks against her as they have always done if you want to see how tough women are ceri dear look at reality we suffer the most discrimination violence abuse and exploitation in the world we are denied education and freedom of movement in some cultures in all cultures we are denied justice we do the hardest most relentless work the work that requires both physical tenacity and concentration and is not coincidentally unpaid or underpaid we are the teachers the mothers the cleaners the housekeepers the carers the nurses the activists the administrators often in addition to our day jobs we are famous for our strength and nonviolence in the face of ubiquitous antipathy luckily its easy to spot a media man whos antiwomen he doesnt employ us as he doesnt like being around us he features one woman because more than one is too many he doesnt cover issues concerning us as hes not interested in us he doesnt speak respectfully about us because he doesnt respect us and he justifies his discrimination by blaming the victim his line is the same as it has been for centuries frailty thy name is woman well malice thy name is man,2010-04,thank ceri thomas saying woman presenting today

being a petite ftin has its advantages i always have plenty of leg room on longhaul flights i can buy clothes from the cheaper teenage ranges on the high street and i can usually extricate myself from difficult situations with a wellplaced smile on the other hand people often assume that im young dumb or a bit of both first glances show long hair and big eyes not the firstclass computer science degree or the two published novels first glances prompt people to ask if i want a child ticket at the cinema or if i have a young persons railcard on the gatwick express they dont show a yearold woman who can lead or command thankfully those initial perceptions change once people talk to me but there is usually a prevailing sense that i need to be protected more than respected a previous manager called me little one on almost a daily basis while another took great pleasure in highlighting a survey which said that on average petite women earn less per year than their taller counterparts i wanted to point out that the correlation could be due to ethnicity rather than height chinese pakistani and bangladeshi women generally being shorter than their white british counterparts but i knew it would appear to be defensive the need to prove my smarts isnt due to a napoleon complex as one might suspect but more to do with the superwoman complex a hyperfeminist need to continuously prove my independence and ability in the latest complexinduced bout of madness i decided to sit a mensa supervised iq test if i passed i would get a conversationfriendly way to broadcast my genius and if i failed then maybe i could finally get rid of the chip on my shoulder the test came back with a score of and an invitation to join the top of the population instead of feeling smug i immediately felt embarrassed the whole exercise suddenly felt cringingly selfindulgent intelligence may be a more respectable pursuit than beauty but i felt as uncomfortable about joining this smartpeoples club as i would joining one for beautiful people british mensa says its purpose is threefold to provide a stimulating intellectual and social environment for its members to identify and foster human intelligence for the benefit of humanity and to encourage research into the nature characteristics and uses of intelligence there isnt much of the latter two happening from what i can see on mensas news page and in this internet age where anyone can find a group of likeminded individuals surely the former is redundant i wanted a way to broadcast my genius yes but not by membership of an organisation whose only real purpose is to allow members to broadcast their genius this brings me to my second issue just how accurate are these tests as a measure of intelligence even the narcissist in me refuses to believe that im more intelligent than people in a random group of and if i am why on earth arent i a bigshot executive doing something smart rather than sitting crosslegged on my bedroom floor merely writing about being smart i may have already answered my own question but is mensa really worth joining is membership respected and impressive or is it a surefire way to lose

sexism in politics is nothing new when youre standing for election but dont stand for election and its almost as bad shockingly david cameron thought it acceptable to claim this week that my decision not to run for the labour leadership was because my husband ed balls stopped me from standing the guardian leader wasnt much better suggesting id chosen to sacrifice all westminster ambitions for ed rightwing bloggers claimed it was proof women cant do top jobs even more friendly supporters told me i was letting women down particularly by mentioning my young children but all this is nonsense and to let these claims go unchallenged would indeed be letting women down because they are also a distraction from the real problems the need to get more women into politics to support working parents across the country and to challenge the toxic mix of ageism and sexism which holds too many women back for a start weve already shown women can do top jobs yes even when the kids are small harriet harman is acting leader of the labour party right now doing a great job in the last years weve had several women cabinet ministers with children under including in my case running a department with a budget over bn nor is this the age of wifely selfsacrifice at least in our house i cant answer for david cameron ed always my strongest supporter said hed back me and stand aside if i wanted to run but this isnt the right time for me and that wouldnt change whether ed was standing or not nor would it change if ed were always at home looking after the kids or if we had a zillion hours of childcare support because yes for me the age of our children is a factor our youngest is only five and it isnt a sign of weakness or a betrayal of women to admit it quite the reverse to ignore or scorn such choices is to fail to understand the lives of millions of working parents especially women and to fail to reflect them in our politics too like plenty of working parents ed and i have to juggle and cut corners to put our family first in our case that meant last saturday that ed stayed home in yorkshire to look after the kids while i made a mile round trip to speak at the progress conference in london i regularly skip important work dinners but i also miss school fetes frequently i need to manage a hour week something few dads or mums would choose and still get back in time most nights to read bedtime stories and argue about the homework and we wouldnt survive without my mum who comes to the rescue whenever things get tight but for me like for many working women this is only possible by being fiercely hardheaded about whats achievable each week i know the extra commitment energy and resilience that labours leadership needs on top of what i already do and i know it wont work for me while the children are young ed has had to agonise about whether this is possible for him with young children too we share stuff including taking the kids to school and he does all the cooking shopping and sorting out the daily chaos of the house i admit a desperate vision of ready meals loomed before me when he decided to stand we also work in very different ways and we dont fit the normal gender stereotypes about multitasking the opposite is closer to the truth so weve made different decisions about what we can do right now but that still leaves a problem there remain far too few women at the top of politics whether they have children or not its not just too few women like me in their thirties and forties managing the kids and political life with the notable exception of harriet and a few others there are too few women in their s and s whose kids have grown up in senior positions too plenty of women in every walk of life choose to delay seeking promotion to work fewer hours or take time out when their children are small but why should we accept that ten or fifteen years later they are still paid less and caught in jobs below their skills and experience too as in so many jobs the problem isnt just too few women managing with young kids there are too few women in their s and s whose kids have grown up in senior jobs too a potent mix of ageism as well as sexism still holds too many women back in politics this matters because the decisions politicians make affect peoples lives labours championing of childcare maternity leave action on domestic violence equal pay and sure start was led most strongly by women mps and ministers in contrast the new conservativeliberal government with only half as many women ministers as labour had is already proving its insensitivity to womens concerns even quite aside from camerons shocking sexism weve had the troubling plan to make rape defendants anonymous and they are showing the same insensitivity in cutting child tax credit something almost entirely paid to women often on much lower pay than their partners too i believe thats one of the reasons women under still proved more likely to vote labour despite the national swing so the challenge for labour is to work even harder than ever both to get more women into politics and to make sure womens concerns are heard in parliament and government too we need to keep supporting women to become mps over half our newly elected labour mps are women bringing us to over of the parliamentary party we need to change our own party rules to aim for half the shadow cabinet being women and we need to change the hours of parliament and the way politics works we also need to keep championing the issues that affect womens lives across the country so whoever wins labours leadership election ill still be there alongside harriet and others campaigning for progressive help for women and as for future leadership contests who

the new child poverty statistics covering the first year of the recession were published on thursday to no fanfare at all perhaps that is because with iain duncan smith now installed at the department for work and pensions dwp there was no desire to highlight what was expected to be strong evidence of success at last for labours child poverty strategy what the figures actually show is something quite different and much more unsettling certainly for the first time in four years the headline child poverty statistic the number of children living in households with an income less than of median income in that year came down albeit by the smallest amount the dwp is prepared to report namely to have reversed the steady upward climb of recent years especially in a recession is a success but it has come at a price between april and january labour threw an awful lot of money at the problem the result was that following two rises in child benefit and the biggest rise in child tax credit since it was introduced in an outofwork family with two children was more than a year better off at the end of the year than it had been at the beginning with several hundred thousand children belonging to families just a few pounds a week below the poverty line which incidentally fell slightly in value year on year on the more sensible after housing costs basis this big increase larger than the previous three years put together was likely to have a positive effect even after allowing for the recession and so it has proved the number of children in poverty in workless households having come down year on year by by contrast the number of children in poverty in working households went up in part this is the effect of the recession the employment statistics show a big increase in parttime working and it is such partworking families where either no one is working fulltime or where one adult is staying at home that are usually the ones who are both in work and in poverty the recession though is only part of the story here with the exception of new labours five golden years starting in inwork poverty has been on a rising trend since at least as long ago as the late s it was the return to rising inwork poverty after that destroyed labours goal of halving child poverty by the way the dwp reports this statistic six in every children in poverty now belong to a working household this proportion is broadly similar for the million workingage adults in poverty the increase in this number over years of million would be seen as a huge policy failure had the previous government ever shown the slightest interest in adults without children and perhaps this in truth is why the dwp has said so little about these figures for it suits politicians of all parties to claim that work is the route out of poverty such a message wraps a snarling toughness directed at workless adults inside a saccharine justification you must work for the sake of your kids the truth is very different work that does not provide a sufficient income is now much more to blame for poverty than worklessness if the new government is serious about poverty reduction it will need to direct its reform efforts not just at the world of welfare but at the world of work too starting with the public sector,2010-05,new child poverty statistic covering first year recession published thursday fanfare

in winifred harper cooley imagined a st century without sweatshops or slums cooley was a us feminist once described as a radiant woman in flowing graceful robes and in this new world she explained no one would be tramping the streets without a home or be unemployed the worlds labour would be shared so that each person only worked five hours a day society would be fair just and equal cooley wasnt alone in her utopian visions radicalised by the movement for the vote as well as by dramatic economic changes many progressive women of her era the late th century to the early s were asking serious farreaching questions about how their sex should behave and live they began with womens experiences of sexual relations mothering domestic labour and paid work and went on to demand social as well as political rights it is thanks to their efforts that we have birth control abortion centres for mothers and babies health visitors child benefit and the minimum wage no small achievement but they wanted so much more a novel by us writer kate chopin the awakening expressed their diffuse desire for personal and social change when the novels heroine sets about casting off her socially imposed role as a woman her adultery scandalises st louis society the books title was echoed in in the awakening of women a supplement produced by the new statesman in which beatrice webb argued that any awakening had to be seen in broader terms than simply the struggle for the vote webb observed that a wider womens movement existed that was related to the international movement of labour and unrest among subject peoples women in this wider movement were challenging not just gender relations but other forms of subordination too among the contributors to the new statesman supplement was charlotte perkins gilman a remarkable woman from the us whose influence was international she called for a larger feminism that would involve altering sexual relationships home life motherhood and the economy gilman managed to earn her living by writing books and articles and in her famous story the yellow wallpaper she described a woman whose sense of self started disappearing into the patterns on her bedroom wall the story was published after gilman broke from the claustrophobia of her own first marriage a separation that brought her agony her daughter remained with her exhusband and freedom in the mids gilman worked with her close friend social reformer helen campbell on a journal called impress calling for a new art of living gilman advocated kindergartens kitchenless homes dance halls and tennis courts in her story what diantha did the heroine runs a restaurant and fooddelivery service that takes meals in insulated containers to emancipated clients in her ironic utopian novel herland the three male visitors are bemused to arrive in an allfemale society in which caring rather than profit defines the economy strong links existed between feminists and radicals in britain and the us and gilmans ideas were discussed in socialist publications what diantha did originally appeared in gilmans feminist magazine the forerunner before being serialised in the leftwing british newspaper the daily herald in britain women on the left were beginning to argue that the responsibility for childcare was not simply an individual matter mothers required resources from society free healthcare maternity allowances nurseries even a pension for mothers to enable them to be independent of men were being mooted among the women influenced by gilman was ada nield chew a workingclass mother and activist in when workers were demanding the eighthour day chew sent a letter to the local paper in crewe arguing that underpaid overworked factory women like her were being ignored they had no time to read to enjoy nature she wrote we cannot be said to live we merely exist a living wage ours is a lingering dying wage i sometimes wax very warm as i sit stitching and thinking over our wrongs chew became involved in the socialist and suffrage movements she was enthusiastic about gilmans ideas for baby gardens where children would learn through play arguing that they benefited mothers and toddlers alike most difficulties are caused by our agelong habit of looking upon what is and what has been as utterly desirable chew declared women such as gilman and chew were grappling with how to improve womens lives but who was to define what women wanted perspectives on their needs were affected by race as well as class in a view from the south africanamerican writer anna julia cooper asserted the claims of pinched and downtrodden coloured women bending over washtubs and ironing boards with children to feed and house rent to pay wood to buy soap and starch to furnish lugging home weekly great baskets of clothes for families who pay them for a months laundering barely enough to purchase a substantial pair of shoes in the late s when the early womens liberation groups began to emerge we were ignorant about this earlier awakening of women we thought many of our utopian ideas were new then we began to discover the part women had played in radical movements and the struggle for suffrage and gradually the extraordinary scope of their visions became clear many of the dilemmas of the past were to be revisited how to balance paid work and mothering how to ensure that caring for children is not simply the responsibility of mothers but includes fathers other adults and wider society how to ensure reproductive rights how to share domestic labour equitably how to end the low pay of women workers how to prevent male violence how to enlarge the scope for democratic participation in politics economic and social life so that all womens needs are acted on like the women of the earlier awakening we were fired by a conviction that it was possible to change just about everything we wanted equal pay and the moon in the s what actually happened of course was rather different many of those questions are still alive on the whole the gains women have made have been affected by the wider social and economic context so for instance european feminists were able to secure reforms such as better maternity leave from social democratic regimes while in america where social provision remains minimal some women have achieved a higher profile in business and finance in britain practical needs such as child care entered the labour agenda while the push for equal opportunities enabled some women to enter better paid jobs however gender equality has proved elusive overall women still earn less than men and because social inequality in britain has intensified since the late s women in lowpaid jobs especially those who are the sole supporters of children have been pushed further down the pile economic slumps are bad news for women many of the gains made by feminists are likely to be under threat thankfully new groups of feminists are now exposing the equality con but the challenge for young and old is this how do we create an alternative and the question is not confined to britain when we look at the global situation the inequalities are even more

mobilise women workers and similar groups have followed their model in other countries a wider vision of economic democracy has begun through participatory budgeting an approach to resources that

statistics facts pah whats great about media reports on gender division of housework are the visuals last week the lse published research featuring thousands of couples dating back to showing that the greater the amount of housework a man does the less likely the couple are to separate even when traditional gender roles are reversed and the mother goes to work and the father is the homemaker the picture a man in a ken barlow below sweater vacuums as a woman lolls on a sofa reading a newspaper posed by models the photo stops short of the man wearing a frilly apron or the woman resting her feet upon his back cackling evilly but the message is clear men doing housework what ballbroken saps it always amazes me when the issue of housework is treated as a joke just a trivial domestic issue not the real stuff of life housework is huge it would take a strange couple to fatally fracture because of a government coalition but there is no more effective way for a man to make a womans life unendurable than by treating her as some kind of kidnapped house slave never mind the heartbreak over infidelity what about the backbreak behind housework statistics men four to five hours a week single women seven hours women with husbands or livein partners more than hours nor should we be distracted by supposed womanonwoman exploitation basically women employing other women as cleaners the vast majority do so not necessarily because they are lazy cows though some of us are but because if they didnt theyd end up doing everything for everybody all the time nor is it the woman singular employing the cleaner to help her it is on behalf of the entire household meanwhile the male retromantra persists housework is unmanly emasculating demeaning id have thought quite the contrary guys using this as a line are one thing if they keep getting away with it who could blame them its those who believe it who shirk housework on the grounds that it undermines their essential masculinity who need to wake up and smell the ecover that bless him hes left his clothes all over the floor attitude propagated by only some mothers and those surrendered wife freaks has been dying out for some time who should be most grateful men of course for the umpteenth time men have to ask themselves how they want their women to regard them as strong capable mature equals unafraid to get their hands dirty or basically another child an irritating boneidle overgrown child men also have to decide who their real lady friends are are those women who expect them to do their fair share really foul nags or merely stating a reasonable fact similarly are those who let them avoid housework who simperingly agree that its womans work a dream come true or control freaks scary wifemummy hybrids who want to undermine their maturity and keep them as dribbling littleboy puppies who cant fend for themselves clearly now more than ever its the latter group who despise and manipulate men who portray them as a subspecies who cant load a dishwasher conversely the women portrayed as antimen are delivering the most promale message youre a grown man housework sucks lets crack on with it and then because one of us isnt frustrated resentful and exhausted we can have some fun together as this study shows men in ken barlow sweaters never had it so good heavily pregnant sexedup and oh so very wrong what was

a mother again grab yourself a hobnob laura bushs lessons for sam cam its not hard to understand why samantha cameron has all but given up her job with smythson with pregnancy a certain house move and the very real threat of having david laws around for dinner here is a woman who has quite enough to cope with but what else is sam cam going to be giving up once she is sucked into the prime ministerial vortex last week laura bush made some poignant remarks about having to keep quiet about her real views on samesex marriages and abortion during her husbands presidency not that mrs bush has suddenly morphed into a composite of radclyffe hall and gloria steinem however it appears she privately held a much more liberal understanding mindset than was evident as she stood smiling silently by her husbands side its good to think of laura outwardly the most unassuming of women walking around the white house secretly disagreeing with elements of hardline republicanism even having nonargumentative debates with dubya in private its not so great to realise that to survive or at least ensure her husbands political survival laura was forced publicly to selfmuzzle samantha cameron should take note while michelle obama or carla brunisarkozy would be her obvious counterparts in simple terms of the political persuasion of her husband she probably has more in common with laura bush if she holds certain views shes going to have to selfmuzzle or risk ruffling pinnies in the home counties come to think of it for all the pictures ive seen of samantha ive yet to hear her voice belatedly the penny drops that before giving up jobs or anything else this is one of the first sacrifices rightwing leaders wives have to make soldier blue a study states that one in seven of our troops uses alcohol to blot out the pressures of war these figures rise for iraq and afghanistan id say the real news is that six out of seven dont turn to alcohol im sure i would though it would be

the abiding image of this last election has been suits on the rolling news through the sound and fury of the leaders debates through the nods and winks of the negotiating committees we have watched a rippling windy sea of grey flannel ebb and flow the tide was occasionally parted by a cardigan or shift dress but only when the media decided to break from more important business to discuss how convincingly the leaders wives were or werent standing stoically by their man female politicians were defined by their invisibility a power vacuum in literal terms so it wasnt a surprise when the election results came in showing the representation of women at a virtual standstill to be precise the percentage of female mps has increased by just or extra mps to stand at of the total perhaps we should be cheered by this after all prior to the expenses scandal and the subsequent remarkable clearout of sitting mps the proportion of women in the commons was actually expected to drop but the turnaround is too small to raise a smile we get a chance to increase womens representation only every four or five years when an election is called at this rate it will be well over two decades before women make up a third of mps the critical mass that studies have deemed necessary to shift the culture of any maledominated institution it could be half a century before women and men sit side by side in the commons in equal numbers this dearth of women is reflected in the number who are now seated around the cabinet table and then some on wednesday it was announced there will be four women in cabinet with only one theresa may the new home secretary in a highly prominent position women are represented even less well in cabinet than they are in the commons generally then only of the total members the question is this what are we going to do about it in terms of the cabinet that ship has sailed as nan sloane director of the centre for women and democracy says cabinets are heavily dependent on the individual personalities of the people putting them together and on the internal politics of specific parties so i think its a bit pie in the sky to assume you could somehow influence it at this stage for a sense of the tory attitude to womens equality its worth noting a recent fawcett society survey which found that on issues including the gender pay gap and the low rape conviction rate of labour candidates responded to say they were committed to tackling the issues of lib dems said the same and just of tories joined the chorus what we can do is challenge the inevitable arguments that women are proportionally underrepresented in cabinet because theyre inexperienced or less talented all those arguments fall immediately says sloane because none of those now in government has any experience cameron hasnt and neither has most of his cabinet if the argument is well you need people with experience ken clarke would be sitting at that table alone wouldnt he of course one way to increase the number of women at the very top is to increase the number of women in parliament in general the uk now stands at in the international league table of womens representation about level with the united arab emirates and below rwanda sweden and afghanistan the countries that top the league havent done so by accident in most of the top nations theres been some form of robust positive action regarding the representation of women says ceri goddard chief executive of the fawcett society thats true of any country where over of the governing body is women sloane says that such action takes one of two key approaches either a proportion of seats in parliament is reserved specifically for women or a proportion of any partys candidates have to be women any talk of quotas can cause uproar in britain but consider this in the last election all three main parties fielded a male candidate in seats all three fielded a female candidate in just seats so for instance in pakistan and india says sloane a third of seats in parliament are reserved for women while in spain at least of parliamentary candidates have to be women and at least have to be men not coincidentally half of spains cabinet is female because the women are there to be chosen sloane thinks that some version of the spanish system would be most workable here because she suspects people would be uncomfortable with an approach that said half the seats in parliament had to be filled by women earlier this year there was a speakers conference which reported that if there was no significant increase in female mps parliament should consider quotas my view is that is not a significant increase says sloane and therefore at some point in this parliament there should be a discussion on this issue goddard agrees fawcett had a roundtable discussion just before the election she says with representatives from all three main parties and all agreed there would be a time for that debate to happen so in terms of a popular movement i think that anyone who has a feminist agenda should be putting significant pressure on the government and on all of the parties to hold true to their promise to at least have this debate seriously publicly in parliamentary time this could go hand in hand with the wider discussions that are taking place on electoral reform womens representation is currently seen as a side or a fringe issue says goddard but clearly when youre talking about rebuilding our political system and radical change to fail to consider it is completely unacceptable we need a major shift in thinking there are other areas where change is needed if were to address the shameful dearth of female politicians the culture of parliament needs to alter to allow women to feel they can take maternity leave for instance and have the same flexible working rights that the rest of us enjoy ive lost count of the number of very capable women ive met says goddard whove said i feel unable to do this because of what the job requires i hear very few men saying that she suggests that people also need to take on the media it was the newspapers that chose to devote more column inches to the leaders wives than they did to women politicians the parties didnt send out press releases on sarah browns shoes the time to address all this is now says goddard when electoral reform is on the agenda shes excited by the way people have been taking on the media through blogging and tweeting and the fawcett phone has been ringing off the hook there is a groundswell of anger her organisation and others plan to launch a major campaign because this is the first big opportunity for a generation to fundamentally challenge the gender imbalance in parliament lets make

the guardians coverage of women recently has been well manly natasha walter is right that years on from the feminist heyday of the s the prospect of equality opportunity never mind reality is as distant as ever she fails however to discuss the real reason women are still having to go through long and miserable battles for equal pay and are opting out from leadership roles in every sector instead of having it all weve ended up doing it all because even armed with legislation the world around us hasnt really changed jesuss disciples were all male and muhammad instructed men to treat your women well the culture today in which women strain to succeed is still shaped by men who thought it a good idea to organise working life so that the age of expected peak professional performance coincides with needy teenage children and failing parents how perverse that paternity man tends to get promotion while a mother has hers delayed how infuriating that the financial times should profile the top women in business without asking if they got there on their own terms or did they assume like david hare that the brutality of power is a given and that it is women who have to shape up to that reality this in essence is what business schools teach with all those competency frameworks and aptitude tests on the promotion trail giving preference to male behaviours with grim humour the uk equality and human rights commissions sex and power survey extrapolated the current rate of change to conclude it would take only slightly less time for women to be equally represented in parliament than it would for a snail to creep the whole length of the great wall of china years snail travel equivalents for equal representation on ftse company boards are a mere years lands end to john ogroats and the judiciary a pacy years nine times round the m all of us triangulate our family and personal life with our professional ambitions and with me time under pressure women tend to cut the me corner first it is the line of least resistance and put family before promotion while most men will chisel first into the family corner innocently or cynically assuming women will take up their slack which we usually do all that effort trying to do right by everyone and still the grain is against us no wonder we get depressed havent we heard enough about how unequal things are for women and of reading about our agony as we decide that squeezing our values our way of thinking working being prioritising deciding loving into the manly models of democracy organisations social and economic processes is not for us who does david cameron think will do all his big society stuff what we need is more analysis of why the way power and control operates in our society is still so antipathetic to women power does not have to be brutal we can organise the way we run our economy and our society so that all can flourish and find satisfaction in every aspect of their lives what is stopping that from happening how come a paper like the guardian has been seduced into giving more coverage to male politicians wives than to a serious example of sensible female political leadership the green partys caroline lucas because whatever the outcome of this election what she stands for and the way she does it has to be a big part of our shared future the path to genuine equality lies not in liberating women but

as a social worker i earned k pro rata down to hours a week i worked hours a week contracted and some weeks more at home i had a caseload of children many of whom were subject to child protection plans the ones not subject to child protection plans were living in situations where the threshold of risk was nightmarish one day of my working week i attended university to complete a postqualifying award as a single parent i did this job and managed my child and house i say managed because i dont describe the two hours a day that i saw my daughter two hours usually preoccupied with either ringing someone i owed money to or sorting my house as parenting when my salary hit the bank it paid my childcare bill and most of my rent the rest being covered by local housing allowance lha after that the income to run my house go to work feed and clothe my child was per week and i had a job where i was constantly subsidising and meeting little costs incurred in doing the work the cost of a kids bus fare a mothers breast pads a cup of coffee for a client i accepted that poverty was part of parenting a preschool aged child on my own when i was exhausted and weighed six stone had severe stomach problems and was barely sleeping my doctor advised me to give up work i did i came home while not working i lived on per week for the first time since my daughter was born while i had no money i had time to get to know her i had time to parent her this year has been wonderful i was better off not because i didnt pay council tax or have the cost of working but because i got to spend real time with my daughter for the first time since she was born but it is ingrained in me that i should work i set myself up as a writer and started to get copywriting work not vast amounts but certainly enough to justify registering as selfemployed enough that i am starting to bring in a relatively steady stream of money i still get full lha which covers about of my rent at the moment that goes down if i earn more as it should i pay the difference it is a hefty chunk out of my disposable income i dont have any more money than i had on income support but i earn it my eye has always been on the day where i could return to work fulltime rachel starts school this september and i got myself a fulltime job yay then the budget happened not only is there a vat increase but lha rules are to be changed instead of paying out the median cost of local rents they will in future only help with the cost of rent up to the th percentile this detail was lost under a great deal of fanfare about housing benefit paying people to live in mansions and then the phone call came it informed me that the job was no longer there to prepare for cuts of across the board they could not risk hiring new staff even if i had started i cannot physically earn enough to take me above the income level of someone on income support i am now going to be competing in a labour market flooded with the people who will be laid off as part of these cuts in a profession with widespread recruitment freezes i am the candidate who might have to disappear because my daughter is ill and the candidate who may not be able to do latenight emergency calls i did everything right when i left home at i knew that education was the key i stayed at school even though it meant living on a week income support i had assumed when i finished school i would never need benefits again i never stopped working apart from a few months of travelling which i paid for i didnt even consider having a child until i was financially secure prepared and married i trained for a career i was passionate about i worked hard i went to university and borrowed k to do so and this doesnt feel quite real i heard the lib dems on telly saying this was progressive and i dont quite know how to process the magnitude of what has just happened to my life and my future this isnt sink or swim economics i dont have the choice of sinking i exist and so does my daughter but i dont have the choice to swim either if i work i am in poverty if i can get work if i dont i am in poverty my daughter is in poverty unless she goes to live with her dad the poverty could be eased by moving away from the community we are part of or finding a relationship which will bring financial security david cameron has been talking about how to make sure the system doesnt reward people for not doing the right thing by staying married and in the spending review frank field and iain duncan smith are anxious to remove the couple penalty from tax credits they calculate this penalty by looking at net state support but with no consideration for the cost of childcare or rent or the earnings potential of a single person with responsibility for a child i am not just a single parent i am an intelligent woman a good mother and i am more than that except i am not more than that i have woken up to find i am societys garbage and with increasing regularity people feel free to tell me that i suppose it feels easier to do so if the prime minister tells you i am part of the reason britain is broken the only difference between a single mother and a married one is a partner another adult to earn money or take responsibility for some of the domestic chores the benefit trap they are removing is the thing that kept me and many of my friends working im not writing about the wider economic issues of a deflationary budget in a country with no private sector economic growth and whose trading partners are also introducing austerity measures i cant get my head round that right now because i am sat here with a calculator not wondering how the budget might affect me but wondering how i am supposed to survive i am not writing this because i want people to feel sorry for me this blog was supposed to be about more than being a poor single mother i didnt see myself like that but this is the reality behind the rhetoric of fairness and it doesnt seem very damn fair to

single parents will be expected to go to work when their youngest child starts school at the age of five under changes outlined in the budget but campaigners said the lack of flexible parttime jobs that would fit around the school day made the policy a major concern mothers and fathers bringing up children on their own currently get income support until the child reaches thereafter they have to start looking for employment in order to claim jobseekers allowance the age limit is already due to go down to seven this autumn and many parents who will also be hit by the other changes to child benefits are anxious about how they would find affordable childcare if forced to work according to kate bell head of policy at gingerbread a lone parents charity while the immediate overall impact of the budget would be broadly neutral for lone parent families the charity was worried they would feel the pain over the coming years particularly as a result of the freezing of child benefit the government estimated the new rule on single parents going to work which will come into force next october and is forecast to save m by would help up to into employment and reduce child poverty but bell said parents tell us that the jobs that would enable them to work and do their best for their children just arent there labour had planned pilots of schemes to make work pay for lone parents in which they could earn more before their benefits were cut she added if the government really wants to help single parents get back to work that would be a helpful place to start lone parents are the group that has moved into work quicker in the past years but it hasnt been because of tougher benefits conditions its due to increases in affordable childcare and measures to make work pay,2010-06,single parent expected go work youngest child start school age five change outlined budget campaigner said lack flexible parttime job would fit around school day made policy major concern mother father bringing child currently get income support child reach thereafter start looking employment order claim jobseekers allowance age limit already due go seven autumn many parent also hit change child benefit anxious would find affordable childcare forced work according kate bell head policy gingerbread lone parent charity immediate overall impact budget would broadly neutral lone parent family charity wa worried would feel pain coming year particularly result freezing child benefit government estimated new rule single parent going work come force next october forecast save would help employment reduce child poverty bell said parent tell u job would enable work best child arent labour planned pilot scheme make work pay lone parent could earn benefit cut added government really want help single parent get back work would helpful place start lone parent group ha moved work quicker past year hasnt tougher benefit condition due increase affordable childcare measure make work pay,"['single', 'parent', 'expected', 'go', 'work', 'youngest', 'child', 'start', 'school', 'age', 'five', 'change', 'outlined', 'budget', 'campaigner', 'said', 'lack', 'flexible', 'parttime', 'job', 'would', 'fit', 'around', 'school', 'day', 'made', 'policy', 'major', 'concern', 'mother', 'father', 'bringing', 'child', 'currently', 'get', 'income', 'support', 'child', 'reach', 'thereafter', 'start', 'looking', 'employment', 'order', 'claim', 'jobseekers', 'allowance', 'age', 'limit', 'already', 'due', 'go', 'seven', 'autumn', 'many', 'parent', 'also', 'hit', 'change', 'child', 'benefit', 'anxious', 'would', 'find', 'affordable', 'childcare', 'forced', 'work', 'according', 'kate', 'bell', 'head', 'policy', 'gingerbread', 'lone', 'parent', 'charity', 'immediate', 'overall', 'impact', 'budget', 'would', 'broadly', 'neutral', 'lone', 'parent', 'family', 'charity', 'wa', 'worried', 'would', 'feel', 'pain', 'coming', 'year', 'particularly', 'result', 'freezing', 'child', 'benefit', 'government', 'estimated', 'new', 'rule', 'single', 'parent', 'going', 'work', 'come', 'force', 'next', 'october', 'forecast', 'save', 'would', 'help', 'employment', 'reduce', 'child', 'poverty', 'bell', 'said', 'parent', 'tell', 'u', 'job', 'would', 'enable', 'work', 'best', 'child', 'arent', 'labour', 'planned', 'pilot', 'scheme', 'make', 'work', 'pay', 'lone', 'parent', 'could', 'earn', 'benefit', 'cut', 'added', 'government', 'really', 'want', 'help', 'single', 'parent', 'get', 'back', 'work', 'would', 'helpful', 'place', 'start', 'lone', 'parent', 'group', 'ha', 'moved', 'work', 'quicker', 'past', 'year', 'hasnt', 'tougher', 'benefit', 'condition', 'due', 'increase', 'affordable', 'childcare', 'measure', 'make', 'work', 'pay']",92
some years since women were first allowed to stand for parliament britain still has one of the smallest percentages of women in government in europe the cabinet has a woeful four female members one of them lady warsi shipped in from the lords a tacit admission that her party was unlikely to find her a safe seat in the commons according to julian baggini as the recriminations and soulsearching over the lack of women in top political jobs continues londons tricycles theatre is staging a cycle of twelve plays entitled women power and politics inevitably one of these looks at the tortured subject of allwomen shortlists ive always found this a difficult one surely in this day and age what could more undermine a female mp in the eyes of her colleagues constituents and bosses than the suspicion that shed only got the job because she had breasts and a womb to me camerons decision to back the policy looked like a lazy illconceived exercise in window dressing symptomatic of the thin backbone of his new conservatism i still have many of the same suspicions about the tories but a recent visit to rwanda made me think again about what we now sensitively call positive discrimination rwanda still bears the scars of the genocide of that left close to million people dead not least in the mentality of its citizens and leaders but it has made astonishing progress in the years since that traumatic event until the global economic downturn it was enjoying doubledigit gdp growth even in its economy grew by its frequently rated the best country in the region for doing business the least affected by corruption the streets are clean crime is low and much of this success is down to the governments dogged determination to force change to shed traditional hierarchies and among other things to actively battle gender discrimination under rwandas constitution one third of parliamentary seats have to be occupied by females over time this has encouraged many talented women to come forward people for whom working in government less than a generation ago would have unthinkable female mps now make up a record of the rwandan parliament a higher proportion than anywhere else in the world and there are eight female cabinet members having met many of these female parliamentarians window dressing is the last description that springs to mind neither does the onethird rule appear to have fostered a sense of entitlement were not just here just because were woman mp constance mukayuhi told me as we stood in the shadow of the rwandan parliament in kigali one afternoon in may im here because ive performed for the last years when elections come round others tells me the ruling rpf party ranks candidates strictly according to their track record the rpfs objective is after all to stay in power fielding substandard candidates just because of their preferred sex would not serve this purpose too well rwandas foreign minister louise mushikiwabo admits that meeting the onethird criteria is sometimes a challenge theyve found it tough to track down enough suitable female ambassadors for instance its something theyre still working on she says but their active willingness to look for encourage and promote able women puts the efforts of countries like our own to shame of course rwanda has the unenviable advantage of having started entirely from scratch after the devastation of the genocide they needed to rebuild their country from less than nothing as one lifelong kigali resident put it but they used this moment as an opportunity the countrys new constitution is the product of a long consultation and research process where systems of government across the world were studied and elements from many were identified incorporated and refined so we are not by any stretch of the imagination comparing like with like yet seeing how much this small country has achieved for women in the past decade while affluent conflictfree britain has achieved so little made me think again about the viability of positive discrimination and even those dreaded allfemale shortlists at a conference i attended in kigali susan page from the us state department told a story

private investing daytrading and playing the stock market has always been a very male affair yet over the past decade more and more women have joined in ten years ago just of the investors who used the online broker selftrade were women this year it is this trend is not restricted to the one website stockopedia a site specialising in broker research and stock market analysis says between and of its user base is female gone are the days when online investing was completely dominated by men says edward croft chief executive of stockopedia there are increasing numbers of smart savvy women out there who are taking up the challenge of making their own investment decisions they are showing that the traditional route of giving full control of your portfolio to an armslength investment adviser is not the only choice many of the women who have turned to share trading have done so very recently selftrades figures show that the proportion of investors using its site that are women jumped from to in just two years the increasing availability of information and share services online has helped fuel this trend it has also shifted the emphasis away from affluent individuals and city workers reading the blogs and message boards of sites ranging from the motley fool and selftrade to interactive investor and stockopedia it becomes very clear very quickly that investors are as diverse as the shares in which they trade the internet has made investing far more accessible and as a result we find that our users come from all walks of life and from all over the uk croft says however as diverse as the investing community may be many recent investors have taken the plunge because they have been dissatisfied by the performance of their more traditional investments so who are the new female investors samina ayub debt recovery officer samina is a typical mum of three kids aged eight four and two she is run off her feet and juggles the school run nursery and childcare and working four days a week as a debt recovery officer samina has always saved she was prompted to take the plunge into buying and selling shares after her two endowment policies with legal amp general and friends provident performed so badly i just didnt make anything on them there was no point in doing them im better off selfinvesting she says her disappointment in the performance of her investments came at the same time as she faced problems in her marriage exacerbating the need for her to exert greater financial control there was a time when i didnt mind someone else investing my money on my behalf but ive had some issues marital problems etc so financially i need to be secure now im much more conscious of the need to plan ahead and ive realised i need more control over what im doing samina has been encouraged by her stepfather zahid who has bought and sold shares for as long as she can remember and has provided her with much appreciated guidance in the past year saminas confidence in her own investing ability has grown now instead of just buying and holding shares she has taken the plunge and sold shares and changed the weighting of her portfolio as the markets have changed at the moment im just invested in uk shares mainly in power companies and energy providers but im also looking to invest in us markets i could trade a lot more than i do but if i traded more id need to do more research and i dont have the time for that im doing this to plan for my future as well not just for the kids saminas confidence has grown so much thanks to the encouragement of zahid that she has now become an advocate of investing and has persuaded one of her friends to take up her hobby my friend is the same age shes with kids the same age shes a training manager with the civil service but ive persuaded her and she now buys shares the risks are high but its the best way to make some money grow if youve got the balls for it kate charity worker kate not her real name began investing in shares after her husband died my husband always managed the money when he died there were all these decisions that id never taken that needed sorting i carried on working and raising the children and didnt really think about any investments other than to use the isa allowance as it came up each year the turning point for kate was when she stopped work seven years ago i just couldnt do the job and raise the kids on my own suddenly she had more time on her hands and could do the research required to make sensible investment decisions i started off really small before it was someone else always doing that investing and shouldering the risk either in funds or in isas so when i started it suddenly seemed really risky to actually hit that buy button but i went in gently and read everything i could kate has researched her investments thoroughly she began by reading around her subjects that gave her the material she needed to home in on her specialism oil kate was looking to invest in something she could hedge against and for her that was commodity shortages many oil companies may list on the london stock exchange and be bought in sterling by uk investors but they are essentially a dollardenominated asset which can remove the sterling risk once i found my forte of my active investing has been in oil shares im not talking giants like bp but small and mediumsized companies their business is simpler to understand than say a bank or a pharmaceutical company because they only have one product so as an investor youre looking to find which company has an edge due to diligence kate has now returned to work for one of britains leading charities and says her investing takes as much time as she wants it to take i dont run shorts derivatives or warrants and i dont do spread betting i just run straight equity positions so i can switch off if im on a fortnights holiday for example im not glued to my pc but i can do as much or as little as i choose cynthia former civil servant now a housewife cynthia who does not want to give her full name feels she has to do her own investing in order to get any returns having seen her hardearned investments reduce in value under the guidance of a broker having worked at the united nationals industrial development organisation unido for years cynthia took its golden handshake payment worth around and moved to the international atomic agency she left the un altogether in and moved to britain with her husband as unido was based in vienna cynthia entrusted her to an austrian broker seven years later her investment is now worth just its really hard to see my money lose so much value but i feel stuck with it now if i take that money out then ive made the loss real id rather keep the where it is in austria and hope it can make up its shortfall i feel like i really have no control over that money when i came to the uk id left my job so i decided to study for a degree in psychotherapy thats finished now and im a housewife for the moment so i have the time to take control of my circumstances again ive always worked and im used to working so i cant just sit and do nothing investing gives me the chance to do my own research and its not that hard if you are thorough having spent most of her working life outside the uk cynthias investing strategy is strictly global her focus is on brazil china and emerging markets when i was with unido i travelled a lot through asia and brazil so i know where the opportunities are for example brazil will be hosting the olympics in so im looking at small and mediumsized construction companies that i know will benefit from that work im also looking in asia im looking long term at construction engineering and technology my mum is from the philippines and ive travelled a lot to asia for work and this is an area i feel i know im comfortable researching the data and the companies here and i will have so much more control over my investment choices by buying and selling my own shares than i would if i chose another broker however cynthia above is not ready to sever all advice ties she has opted for an advisory online service rather than an executiononly one because she feels reassured that she can talk through her decisions i can do all my own research and come up with my choices but then i can doublecheck as well before taking the plunge she says it wont all be

a storm is brewing at middle temple one of the four inns of court that have the exclusive right to call people to the bar female barristers are trying to organise a nursery in the midst of their maledominated profession but the exec has slapped down their proposals citing concerns about a loss of rental income campaigners accuse them of being more alarmed by a potential change in ambience the final decision will be made a week today to realise why this nursery is important you need to understand this job not only are the hours long and unpredictable but most barristers work freelance which means there is virtually no system of benefits or maternity pay and no obligation to take a woman back who has time off to have children this puts huge financial pressure on female barristers to work beyond their limits one mother i spoke to said she was working hour days until the night of her babys birth while looking after another toddler at home she returned to work just two weeks after a complicated caesarean suffering from exhaustion being a mother is challenging in any profession being a barrister too is a health hazard with such long and irregular hours mainstream nursery provision isnt always suitable for barrister parents and agency workers are hard to bring in without notice the only real option is a nanny but these are phenomenally expensive i spoke to women who were paying anything from to a month for carers in london after vat and chambers fees for junior barristers or those working in the public sector work can become a luxury they cannot afford even with a nanny barristers talk about the stress of having to leave the office at pm to get across london when the care ends a move that frequently means missing emergency counsel meetings if the nanny is sick or there is a sudden need to travel there is no backup i spoke to one woman who said that she had been forced to ask her chambers reception to form a crash creche while she attended lastminute meetings after years of investing in her profession she is considering leaving rather than having her second child while in work it doesnt feel like a choice these are more than oneoff anecdotes they are systemic problems that are reflected in the hard statistics across the industry although the intake of female barristers is good the dropout rate is so high that there are currently twice as many male barristers in selfemployed practice as women of the applicants for qc rank in just were women and there has only ever been one woman on the supreme court a recent survey showed that less than onethird of newly appointed partners to top law firms were women an onsite nursery would help prevent this drain of talent open from ampm it would stop mothers from having to rush home and miss evening meetings knowing they could work later would also allow them to take a lunch break and visit their children on site the female barristers ive spoken to say the men at the top dont get these arguments because they have always had wives at home to support their careers but there may be a legal argument for childcare that the authorities do understand as at least hybrid local authorities the inns have a duty to promote equality of opportunity and a failure to comply with these regulations could cause problems presented with the legal case for a nursery authorities may yet find room at the

should i say i have kids when applying for jobs in law i am a female mature student of studying a masters in law in the evenings after work i really enjoy my course and have begun applying for training contracts with law firms to begin in after doing a legal practice course my difficulty is whether to mention that i have two preschool age children i set up a small business during my first maternity leave and would like to mention this in applications as it has been relatively successful but would you advise not mentioning children i plan to stop the business this summer due to time pressures but to carry on working i have good grades so far and am aiming to get a distinction overall but is it an achievement that i have done this while looking after children and working or is it not worth mentioning i am thinking any employer looking at my age may expect me to have children already or want children in the near future but i just want some advice on the best way to present myself your hesitation is understandable potential employers entirely naturally hope to take on employees who are not only fully qualified but also reliable in attendance and punctuality and nobody can seriously doubt that the mothers of young children find juggling the often fiercely competitive demands of home and work a perpetual challenge so as many stories testify when faced with two candidates of equal merit one with young children and one without many employers have chosen the one whos quite simply going to find it easier to put work first thats tough on people such as you but its also hard not to have some sympathy with the employers its not that theyre necessarily ruthless capitalist pigs a member of staff who through no fault of her own is sometimes bound to be a little late or absent puts inevitable extra burdens on her work mates despite all this i believe you should be entirely open in your application i know its easy enough for me to urge you to reveal all im not the one taking the risk and it must ultimately of course be your decision but particularly in your case it seems to me that youve everything to gain from mentioning your children by doing so you acknowledge an employers possible concerns then swiftly provide reassurance by demonstrating how youve managed so impressively in the past its a huge achievement on your part to have looked after your children to have run your own business and to have done so well in your law course and finally never forget concealment cant last forever if you seem at interview stage to have deliberately withheld a piece of information that might have been significant youll invite unnecessary doubts about your integrity how can i move from unpaid internships to a salaried position last year i was made redundant from a marketing and communications management role i was unhappy with in an industry i hated i received a good payout and decided to follow a career in politics and public affairs a lifetime interest and the subject of my first degree my ultimate goal is a job in parliamentary campaigning for a charity or in a public affairs agency i am also studying a masters degree to support my move its been hard work but nine months on ive been fortunate enough to gain good experience with an mp in a major political party and i feel that i am heading in the right direction feedback has always been very positive and i have made some good contacts however i seem unable to move beyond the internvery junior role and i am tiring of working for free although i was paid by the mp on a parttime basis i feel that people are getting a bit of a bargain particularly given my previous communications experience many of the skills are very transferable i also think that my maturity im in my early s gives me a good competitive edge at this level how can i move on to a properly salaried role or how can i negotiate an intern role up to a salaried role i know i wont be earning my previous salary yet and its an extremely competitive field in a tough climate but i dont think a starting salary is unreasonable that nine months will have seemed like a couple of years to you but its still only nine months and thats not a long time for someone even with previous relevant experience to prove themselves in a new role i can understand your impatience but from what you tell me youve already done well as youre already aware there are lots and lots of younger people only too willing to work for little or nothing in your fascinating world so you must be careful not to feel entitled to anything with all the cuts going on around us and a new mood of restraint apparent just about everywhere everyone in politics will be looking to get all the help they can for as little as they can and ideally for free youre extremely lucky that youre doing something youve always longed to do and have already made some good contacts theyll prove to be priceless but be patient for a little longer and resign yourself

around the dinner table with a bunch of medics last night i listened as a couple of female doctors gave a distinguished surgeon a hard time over the absence of women in his line of work when i opened todays guardian i found harriet harman making the same complaint about the shadow cabinet the old sawbones at dinner gave as good as he got in almost every country in the world despite all their different customs and traditions the proportion of women surgeons is to he said why some evidence suggests women are more naturally attracted to other medical specialities with more clearcut decisions than the blood and glory of the operating theatre the surgeon said there are female surgeons in his own family he added the women present were not impressed and blamed the macho culture that underpins the surgeons maledominated trade theres a flavour of the controversy in a qampa i found here and a more upbeat take here at dinner it was all goodnatured as it often is although not always in politics but it made me wonder yet again why it seems so hard for some women to accept that equal opportunity may not simply be a numbers game because other women may have different instincts and priorities they include the mformotherhood word its very human tug on career patterns so difficult to acknowledge in some progressive circles but there are lots of other reasons not everyone wants to play god or chop up other people it doesnt just apply to women either that alan johnson always strikes me as very grounded very normal quite in touch with his feminine side i dare say we just knew didnt we that he was going to be far too sensible to get mixed up in this party leadership lark i expect hed prefer to play with his grandchildren does he have any than do pmqs or insert stents harman wants the labour shadow cabinet due to be elected in the autumn to have a split between men and women ed miliband the candidate best placed to pick up leadership second choices in a runoff between ed balls and his brother david backs her he had previously called for of places to be reserved for women but hey theres an election on but why seek parity of the labour mps elected on may are women more than half the new parliaments total of compared with in and just in twentytwo per cent thats the same ratio as female surgeons isnt it it was labour that forced the breakthrough electing of the women mp in thanks in part to controversial allfemale shortlists i was always in favour of them in theory quotas are unattractive and unfair as the daily mail and daily telegraph remind us in whites excluded articles several times a week but in practice they are a good shortterm device to address a particular problem in labours case this was accentuated by the fact that british women tend to vote more conservatively than men labours values and achievements such as the nhs and child benefit were attractive to women but not what was widely seen as its more male culture thats changed a good deal but how far do you take a good idea and how do you square it with such awkward facts that labour has long since dropped having an elected womens section in elections to its national executive committee where half the members mps trade union representatives and activists are female goodo but half the places on the shadow cabinet to be reserved for women why onethird of labour mps are women many are new but so are the men allfemale shortlists have given a legup to women which was not available to margaret beckett and betty boothroyds generation or to harmans elected in i keep being told what a tough lot tougher than the blair landslide class of the new intake is but the interesting question to my mind remains what happened to the class of you would surely have expected more women to be in contention for labours top jobs but no of the class of women who made it into cabinet only yvette cooper is still a player and has had three children too hazel blears who has no children became expensesdamaged goods ruth kelly who had four children while an mp left parliament jacqui smith was defeated older women have left too not beckett while vera baird the impressive qc who succeeded mo mowlam in redcar was defeated another victim of the major local steel closure patricia scotland the former attorney general was never an mp but none of them are running for party leader not even the redoubtable harman the task of raising the flag for women has been left to diane abbott who has won little support i made the mistake of thinking that at least some female mps would back her on principle it looks as though i am wrong and that she wont get the qualifying votes im open to persuasion that i might be wrong on the wider issue too but not today yes i know a higher proportion of women get elected mps in many countries the germans may be about to elect a female president to go with their female chancellor its also a striking fact that a cluster of south asian countries muslim and hindu not to mention the catholic philippines and buddhist sri lanka persistently elect female prime ministers just the opposite of what one might predict especially in the muslim states of pakistan indonesia and bangladesh burmas celebrated opposition leader aung san suu kyi is of course a woman too these disparities are interesting and deserve more attention what are they telling us and where is the next margaret thatcher id like to know meanwhile a labour insider reminds me that cooper is still only and may be much more electable as a future labour leader than her husband ed balls but she has a young family and anyway whats the hurry when the coalition looks dug in for a while eh chaps ps theres an international association of women surgeons which seeks to promote the cause,2010-06,around dinner table bunch medic last night listened couple female doctor gave distinguished surgeon hard time absence woman line work opened today guardian found harriet harman making

a groundbreaking study has found that mothers can go back to work months after the birth of their child without the babys wellbeing suffering as a result by assessing the total impact on a child of the mother going out to work including factors outside the home american academics claim to have produced the first full picture of the effect of maternal employment on child cognitive and social development their conclusion will provide comfort for thousands of women who reenter the employment market within a year of giving birth the good news is that we can see no adverse effects said american academic jane waldfogel currently a visiting professor at the london school of economics this research is unique because the question we have always asked in the past has been if everything else remains constant what is the effect of a mum going off to work but of course everything else doesnt stay constant so its an artificial way of looking at things family relationships family income the mental health of the mother all change when a mother is working and so what we did was to look at the full impact taking all of these things into account in one of the most fraught areas of social policy and research several studies over the past two decades have suggested that children do worse if their mothers go back to work in the first year of their lives recent research by the institute for social and economic research at essex university found that children of mothers who went back to work within the first three years were slower learners and a unicef study recommended that mothers stay at home for the first months or gamble with their childrens development the pew research centre in washington found high levels of anxiety among women over the issue the new study led by new yorks columbia university school of social work was published last week by the society for research in child development the national institute of child health and human development study of early child care followed more than children from geographic areas aged up to seven tracking their development and family characteristics it found that while there are downsides to mothers taking work during their childs first year there were also significant advantages an increase in mothers income and wellbeing and a greater likelihood that children receive highquality childcare taking everything into account the researchers said the net effect was neutral the effect of the parenting itself is the key factor said waldfogel it is hugely important how sensitive you are to your childs needs even for women who have to work more than hours a week they can make things better for themselves they just need to take a deep breath on the doorstep dump all the office worries behind them and go in the door prepared to pay attention to all their childrens cues this is good news for all mothers im actually delighted to have been able to disprove earlier studies we just had to ask some different questions and this approach of looking at the whole picture is definitely the right question to be looking at this is especially good news for us mothers who typically go back to work after three months because of the lack of maternity leave but it equally will apply to the typical british family waldfogel added that parttime work up to hours a week provides more desirable outcomes than fulltime employment the authors attribute their striking findings to the rich data used in the study detailing parentchild interactions income and childcare they also used an analytic method that allowed them to calculate the total effect of maternal employment taking into account all knockon effects parents and campaigners welcomed the findings siobhan freegard cofounder of the parenting website netmums said the results would be embraced by every working mother and pointed out that many women had no choice but to work and their attitude was often we are doing our best sally gimson director of communications at the family and parenting institute said the quality of childcare was crucial women should not feel guilty whatever choices they make and that does not mean you have to make the choice to work often it is the more welloff women who have the choice while many others have to work gimson said sam willoughby wanted to go back to her job at a financial services company parttime after having her daughter alice but they were incredibly inflexible she said she decided not to return and now runsmumandworkingcouk which aims to help mothers find flexible options both full and parttime so many things make working mothers feel awful but the reality is as this study shows that going back to work is acceptable there is a notion that mothers should spend all their time with their children but that is wrong you need to also do things that are just for you and a career can give you that julie wilson returned to work full time when her first son james was six months old we had a really good nursery nearby and it was absolutely fine i really enjoyed my job and never considered changing my hours i dont feel he missed me he was happy at nursery he was occupied all the time later on it was really educational when her second son ben was born she returned to work again but went parttime wilson who now works as a freelance thinks the decision to work had no negative impact

its unusual for a book that takes its title and its epigraph women hold up half the sky from mao zedong to receive such critical and popular acclaim in the us as half the sky by pulitzerprizewinning american journalists nicholas d kristof and sheryl wudunn its not until page that we learn who actually said the words that figure on the dedication page simply as chinese proverb then it turns out that husband and wife team kristof and wudunn dont really believe them anyway for the last words of the book urge us to get on with it and speed up the day when women truly hold up half the sky nothing in half the sky how to change the world is new or news although it is sometimes made to appear so in chapter kristof and wudunn describe microcredit as a revolution sweeping the developing world the grameen bank was pioneered in bangladesh years ago it has been a proper bank since owned by more than million borrowers of whom are women with a loan collection rate of almost kristof and wudunn mention muhammad yunus who won a nobel prize for the idea in but only to describe the motivation of roshaneh zafar who set up the pakistani version kashf in kashf has yet to reach its millionth client meanwhile a variety of microfinance corporations followed the business plan of the grameen bank and are now handling bn bn worth of loans kristof and wudunn tend to pussyfoot around the reasons that the preferred clients for microcredit are female firstly they suggest that poverty has greater impact on women the business reason is that womens credit performance is better than mens the moral reason that women dont spend the money on their own immediate gratification but invest it in family business and community yet it would seem from the worldwide reaction to half the sky since it was first published in the us in september it has sold over hardback copies the paperback has now been on the new york times bestseller lists for seven weeks that it has surprised people melinda gates found it a brutal awakening where can she have been the jacket quote from khaled hosseini bestselling author of the kite runner nails what to me at least is worrisome about the book for him it is a savage indictment of gender inequality in the developing world true the developed world gets off scotfree we begin with the story of cambodian srey rath who went to thailand to work was forced into prostitution and traded to malaysia succeeded in escaping was imprisoned under malaysian antiimmigrant law and released after a year only to be sold by the police to a trafficker who sold her on to a brothel in thailand the justification for prefacing half the world with this story is that raths saga offers a glimpse of the brutality inflicted routinely on women and girls in much of the world routinely though such cases are far too easy for journalists to find the inference that they are routine indicts whole nations of criminal misogyny the trafficking of women from the european countries of albania bulgaria belarus moldova and the ukraine to other european countries merits a sentence we are never reminded that the us is a prime destination for trafficked individuals instead the us appears as the potential saviour in practically all cases when rath finally escaped from the thai brothel and returned to cambodia she was put in touch with an american charity set up by a newsweek journalist specifically to help trafficked girls the charity gave her to set herself up as a street trader the authors describe brutality towards women as a malignancy that is slowly gaining recognition as one of the paramount human rights problems of this century raising awareness of brutality towards women is not a slow process the problem is rather that the flash of outrage soon dissipates to lie dormant until somebody or something triggers it again while the vileness carries inexorably on partly because the concerned public is unaware of its own misogyny panic about trafficking has gripped the british on and off since the uproar about whiteslaving in the s when ladies who routinely illtreated their maids put on their hats and went to hear rousing denunciations of the evil foreigners who snatched beautiful young englishwomen off the streets and sold them into prostitution it is years since the passing in the us of the whiteslave traffic act usually called the mann act when the un general assembly adopted the convention for the suppression of the traffic in persons and of the exploitation of the prostitution of others in it was the culmination of a series of enactments designed to deal with what was perceived to be an international scourge for kristof and wudunn the passing of the us trafficking victims protection act of was a milestone in raising awareness of international trafficking on the global agenda as year on year the us fails to pay its un dues and most americans are unaware of the existence of other hemispheres anyway perhaps it was the book lays out an agenda for the worlds women focusing on three particular abuses sex trafficking and forced prostitution genderbased violence including honour killings and mass rape and maternal mortality which still needlessly claims one woman a minute genderbased violence here includes wifebeating in asia but not wifekilling in britain or america rape has become endemic in south africa we learn as if rape had not coexisted with apartheid the solution is apparently a gadget called rapex a tube with barbs inside which a woman puts in her vagina before she goes on a date the kristof and wudunn slant on this craziness is that the rapex is a reflection of the genderbased violence that is ubiquitous in much of the developing world misogyny is as real in the us as anywhere else on earth people who think charity begins at home will be driven to apoplexy by the authors certainty that the us has the answers global figures for domestic violence are cited but examples of women whose sexual experience began with a rape or attempted rape are drawn from ghana nigeria and south africa the evidence about the involvement of women soldiers in sexual violence is taken not from abu ghraib but from sierra leones civil war from haiti and rwanda in contemplating these horrors kristof and wudunn sometimes become downright owlish in their capacity for incomprehension women have suffered grievously in the genocides of rwanda and darfur men too in darfur after interviewing several women who had been raped when leaving their camps to get firewood we asked the obvious question if women are raped when they get firewood why dont the men collect firewood answers on a postcard and lets not forget that immediately after the war the population of rwanda was female in a later chapter the authors sing the praises of rwanda for having the highest share of women members of parliament without appearing to suspect that this may also be a consequence of genocide with no sign of a shudder they intone that rwanda is one of the least corrupt fastest growing and best governed countries in africa one of them you have to wonder what the others are kristof and wudunn have done the usual pulitzer thing of finding specific cases to illustrate general points frankly they write we hesitate to pile on the data since even when numbers are persuasive they are not galvanising a growing collection of psychological studies show that statistics have a dulling effect while it is individual stories that move people to act individual cases cannot prove that behaviours are routine or ubiquitous the authors state with confidence that no group systematically abuses young women more cruelly than mothersinlaw mothersinlaw do not form a group the group with whom they identify is their extended family sure a vicious motherinlaw can drive a young wife to selfharm and suicide but in village society a wise motherinlaw knows that if she is to build a strong cohesive family she needs to earn the love of her daughtersinlaw in the developed world she wouldnt have the option so while the primary purpose of a new movement on behalf of women is to stop slavery and honour killings they write another is to expose young americans to life abroad so that they too can learn and grow and blossom and then continue to tackle the problems as adults nothing in this book would suggest to young americans that their lifestyle perpetuates the poverty that lies at the root of developingworld brutality towards women do they know who made their jeans do they realise that they havent the option of buying americanmade because if they do the asian sweatshop worker will be thrown out of work international aid programmes are infested with people seeking their own salvation at other peoples expense if kristof and wudunn have their way there will be a whole lot more of them a number of explanations for the intractable rate of maternal mortality that continues to bedevil the world are suggested but poverty is left out doctors allan rosenfield and deborah maine wrote their seminal article on maternal mortality for the lancet in in rosenfield received a m grant from the bill and melinda gates foundation to set up a programme called averting maternal death and disability if brilliance and application had been enough rosenfield might have done it but mothers are still dying and for the same reason poverty poverty leads to illiteracy low status poor nutrition teenage pregnancy poor physical development lack of infrastructure and lack of resources and expertise multimilliondollar programmes enter the scenario much too late meanwhile as western doctors win awards for setting up humanitarian programmes in thirdworld countries we harvest the doctors who trained in those same countries whose skills are better adapted to the needs of rich patients than to those of their own rural poor the chapter entitled family planning and the god gulf argues that secular bleeding hearts and religious bleeding hearts will have to forge a common cause if there is to be a successful movement on behalf of women in poor countries the discussion of this issue is dominated by american policy in regard to support of the united nations population fund unfpa and any other family planning organisations that can be found to have supported abortion programmes kristof and wudunn have no objection to the involvement of religious organisations in international programmes indeed they counsel getting the pentecostalists on board because they already have so much influence in the developing world as far as they are concerned dealing with the agonies of women is a matter for charity which they sometimes misname as philanthropy the love of humanity has to be a better motive for intervention than the love of god you would think or even feminism a word that the authors use very oddly usually to pillory an attitude they find fundamentally unreasonable they praise the small campaign for female education charity camfed which was set up by ann cotton to fund girls education first in zimbabwe and now in zambia tanzania and ghana because of what it doesnt do we highlight camfed partly because we believe an international womens organisation needs to focus less on holding conventions or lobbying for new laws and more time in places like rural zimbabwe listening to communities and helping them get their girls into schools without feminism its difficult to imagine how an international womens movement could get off the ground anyone would think that there was a naughty international womens organisation that did nothing but have conventions and lobby for new laws the equal rights amendment was never ratified in sainted america american feminists might find that embarrassing but they gave up lobbying about it long ago funnily enough when it comes to discussing microcredit kristof and wudunn decide that new laws and more women in parliament are exactly what is needed the authors have no critique of globalism to offer nor do they appear to grasp how western economic power keeps the developing world too poor to develop astoundingly they suggest that what women need is more sweatshops the factories prefer young women perhaps because theyre more docile and perhaps because their small fingers are more nimble for assembly or sewing so the rise of manufacturing has generally raised the opportunities and the status of women the implication is that instead of denouncing sweatshops we in the west should be encouraging manufacturing in poor countries particularly in africa and the muslim world one of the best parts of the book unexpected given its own brief is the short discussion of female genitalcutting and the success of a grassroots organisation called tostan in changing attitudes the impulse behind half the sky is a good one anyone who has endured the talkfests of the un for decade after weary decade and seen massive aid projects miss their mark and collapse in a welter of bad faith will echo the authors certainty that it is now down to ordinary people to do practical things for other ordinary people it is tempting to believe that with our loose change we can loosen chains and that the internet will make real help possible as it has never been before the only really enviable privilege that the privileged have is the chance to do good kristof and wudunn make it sound easy its practically impossible but half the sky does make you want to try half the sky how to change the world is published by virago on

immersed in genderqueer circles before i began the real life experience i contemplated the idea of passing with the utmost suspicion the books i read suggested that to pass was to conform to an antiquated binary that suffocated more diverse and fun forms of gender expression exploring territory between male and female in safe spaces thinking less about how id developed strategies to pass in my assigned gender in everyday life i was convinced that transsexual women striving to pass were letting down those fighting for greater trans visibility five minutes of navigating brightons streets en femme made me reconsider passing was now a matter of necessity rather than choice visibility was met with cries of geezer or tranny sarcastic wolf whistles or things thrown from cars i soon understood why most trans women dont aim to be visible at least not when theyre doing their laundry these heckles always came from men usually in groups and i soon drafted my first law of transphobic comment the unimaginativeness of the comment is directly proportional to the unattractiveness of the commenter in one of my first lessons in what it means to live as female i had to consider what types of clothing would draw unwanted attention this meant trying to avoid the classic maletofemale trap of wearing clothes that looked wrong for my age one id fallen into before transitioning wearing floral dresses to clubs only to be told by strangers that you look like my mum i was reminded of my fumbling attempts to learn german and the difference between reciting phrases in a surrey classroom and attempting to converse in berlin guten tag ich mchte oh youre english i realised id have to try harder to learn the language of fashion as not everyone would greet my failures as amicably as the staff in bohemian berlin cafs i decided to ignore any abusive comments they were more irritating than threatening and fairly infrequent but they still made me angry and the realisation that any response could draw further abuse or even violence made me depressed and paranoid about every aspect of my appearance this became apparent in my body language consequently the catcalls came more often after trying some makeup in town six lads pointing and jeering screamed look at that man i changed direction and hoped they wouldnt follow i vowed to switch to trousers and tshirts but the abuse kept coming soon doing anything seemed a drag it felt impossible even to go to the supermarket five minutes away without hassle dressed as inconspicuously as possible i was in the coop when a hideous man in a pink shirt leant over and asked excuse me are you a geezer i dont need this i thought im just buying basil i looked him in the eye and said can you leave me alone please to my astonishment he apologised profusely until a sales assistant asked him not to harass the customers then he left without fuss i realised that confidence is the key to passing or at least to silencing the hecklers considering myself above them i held my head high aware that any abuse could be easily met there was a certain pleasure in answering geezer with wanker and an enjoyable smugness in knowing that this was the worst weapon the transphobes had to throw in broad daylight in a comparatively tolerant city that is walking alone at night was a different story i soon figured that trans women face the same misogynistic attention as other women complicated by the removal of some mens limits on violence towards women the second were read as trannies sometimes groups of drunken men would read me i knew better than to answer back pretending id not heard and quickly walking away sometimes they wouldnt read me and id receive misogynistic abuse instead of transphobic insults as i became more selfassured in myself and in my appearance the comments all but stopped and my attitude shifted again away from the bustle of the city streets i realised as julia serano says that the concept of passing casts all trans people as deceivers something many of us internalise being a consequence of other people gendering us passing should not be an active verb as were passive in having our identities judged derided and denied by nontrans people this too is often internalised and passing has become one of the most important issues for transgender and transsexual people with the fear of not passing by association driving a wedge between those who pass easily and those who dont historically this has been one of the biggest barriers to forming any sort of trans community on a practical level id learned how draining it could be not to pass and felt thankful that genetic good fortune meant that passing was at least possible in certain situations living in stealth though felt neither plausible nor desirable for me unless i cut myself off from friends and family who knew my history as transsexual women were often told to do in the past more to spare their acquaintances the embarrassment of being associated with transsexuals than to make their own lives happier or easier i decided to draw a line id try to pass on the street without striving too hard to hide my intergender status in situations where people knew and accepted it at least in the earliest stages of transition more relaxed i could then consider the cost and implications not to mention the desirability of the various options available to feminise my face body and voice perhaps one day ill be lucky enough to have the problem faced by friends who transitioned years ago how and how much to be open about a transsexual history they feel to be central to their identities when physically theyre indistinguishable from people born female or male in the case of my femaletomale friends for now though i want a break from thinking about passing as for everyone else being is work enough for me juliet jacquess column appears fortnightly you are invited to post comments and questions for juliet below and are very welcome to share

if you want to gauge the energy in the current british feminist movement you have to speak to the young campaigners alex corwin has defined herself as a feminist since she started reading avidly about womens issues a few years ago aged it made her so angry she had to become an activist corwin joined a local grassroots group sheffield fems and since then she has taken part in campaigns that run the gamut local international political cultural she could recently be found in a highstreet newsagent armed with postit notes to stick on the halfclad women in mens magazines inscribed with the words what if she was your daughter once a month she and the group set up a stall in their local shopping centre campaigning on issues including lesbian gay bisexual and transgender rights and how climate change affects women worldwide last year the group helped organise a wellattended conference in they ran a campaign to stop a branch of us restaurant chain hooters where lightly clothed women serve up the burgers opening in sheffield theyre also working on a feminist survival guide to answer questions including do you burn your bra and what can i do about lads mags if she could achieve one lasting change what would it be a total overhaul of the way society sees women she says she is exactly the type of feminist who catherine redfern and kristin aune are celebrating in reclaiming the f word the new feminist movement the books title isnt supposed to suggest feminism ever went away groups as disparate as justice for women the fawcett society southall black sisters and karma nirvana have been working for womens rights for decades now but when redfern started feminist website the f word in she felt there was a general perception that young women werent interested and that the movement was therefore gasping its last people in the media kept saying that feminism was dead says redfern and deriding it year after year as a young lecturer aune noticed the same problem in academiashe met plenty of young feminist students but a lot of older academic feminists didnt seem to believe it the idea of the book says redfern was to try and present a snapshot of the movement and bring it into the mainstream the reader they had in mind aune continues was someone whos vaguely interested in gender issues but hasnt had something that really makes the connections for them each chapter focuses on a different area of current feminist thought and action including arguments around violence against women equality in the home and workplace and sexism in popular culture the book ends with the results of an extensive survey redfern and aune aimed at feminist groups that was started in initially they sent it to organisations but the long complicated questionnaire was eventually passed around to groups newly committed newly inspired feminist campaigners responded and aune says they could easily have tripled that number if necessary threequarters of the respondents were under its just one of many signs that we seem to be entering a new heyday for british feminism another is the sudden burst of british feminist publishing after an extensive drought along with redfern and aunes book the past months has seen the publication of ellie levensons the noughtie girls guide to feminism nina powers one dimensional woman natasha walters living dolls the return of sexism sheila rowbothams dreamers of a new day and kat banyards the equality illusion the truth about men and women today there are more books in the pipeline caitlin moran the times journalist who won columnist of the year at the british press awards is apparently hard at work on a book about the future of feminism and the young feminist writer laurie penny has her own take coming out soon and published next month in the uk after achieving bestseller status and causing quite a stir in the us is half the sky turning oppression into opportunity for women worldwide by husband and wife pulitzerprizewinning journalists nicholas d kristof and sheryl wudunn which reports on the plight of women in the developing world walter has been speaking at events around the country and says the feedback has been phenomenal her talk at the brighton festival completely sold out in quite a big venue i think theres a real hunger to talk about feminism the mood is very different she says to years ago when she published the new feminism and was met with a bruising response from many female journalists people are ready to debate this seriously again kat banyard agrees earlier this year she set up social networking website uk feminista where local grassroots groups can meet debate and build strong supportive ties banyard who is in her late s has been running successful annual feminist conferences for the past six years and has also decided to run a uk feminista summer school taking place next weekend where activists will learn how to campaign more effectively she has been stunned by the response in the first hours people registered she says and three days on we had a couple of hundred ive never seen anything like it im used to spending six to nine months building up that kind of attendance at feminist events when i ask what explains this surge of interest banyard says that significant triggers arise almost every week over the last few months weve had the actor danny dyer inciting readers of zoo magazine to cut their exs face weve had news of padded bras for sevenyearolds weve had an absence of women on the election campaign trail the announcement of anonymity for rape defendants with headline after headline were seeing a continuing need for feminism and with each new incident people are getting involved the movement is wellrepresented across the country aune says she was surprised by the huge amount of activity in scotland and banyard points out that new groups include the belfast feminist network newcastle feminist book group fawcett essex group and cardiff feminist network this last group was set up by hannah austin earlier this year within a week she says there were around members suswati basu a yearold who is currently studying mandarin at the school of oriental and african studies soas in london embodies the movements drive and excitement she has been a feminist activist for four years now in which time she has campaigned against student beauty pageants and been involved with the london feminist networks annual reclaim the night marches largescale protests against male violence which started in the s died out in the s and were successfully revived in basu has also taken part in protests with the activist group object which many of the feminists i speak to describe as the most inspiring campaign around object has been challenging the sexual objectification of women since forming in and they scored their two biggest successes last year securing changes in the laws surrounding lapdancing clubs and prostitution the young feminists who are spearheading this new activism clearly have enormous energy ambition and idealism and in many cases are doing brilliant work but the question of where the movement goes next of what its prime focus should be remains to be answeredthe current burst of feminist publishing is promising but much of it repackages longstanding arguments the noughtie girls guide to feminism is as its title suggests a lighthearted look at the topic reclaiming the f word is a useful book for its expected audience women discovering feminism for the first time but doesnt set out to present unexpected new arguments dreamers of a new day is a fascinating look at the women who were fighting for social justice in the late th and early th century but its context is historical nina powers book one dimensional woman lays claim to new ground but at words is an opening gambit in a bigger battle theres a need for new thinking and more publishing then as well as more focusif as corwin suggests the aim of todays activists is to completely change society then questions remain about where to channel their energy should the focus be on getting more women into parliament getting more women out of prostitution does having more women at the top help all the women further down the ladder should activists focus on the sex industry equal pay violence against women international issues and if individuals and groups choose to tackle all of these how much change can they achieve if inequality between men and women is structural a web of discrimination in which the dearth of women in politics intersects with the portrayal of women in pornography which intersects with the tendency for women to be paid less than men the depiction of women as obsessed with shoes the likelihood that female plaintiffs will be disbelieved in rape cases the attempts to undermine womens abortion rights if the situation of women in britain has an impact on women in france the us iraq afghanistan and the democratic republic of congo then which threads do we pull to make the most impact in bringing the whole web down it feels as though theres so much interest says walter from so many different areas that something positive has to happen but whether it will its hard to know im heartened by the rise in activism says walter but the questions well all be asking ourselves over the next year are how wide is this new wave will it touch people beyond the usual suspects will it galvanise energy more widely in the grassroots bring in other classes women of other backgrounds and will it also touch women who have the power and influence to change things im not saying that women arent asking these questions so its not a criticism of whats going on but its the challenge i feel that were beginning to see more happening but at the moment its still quite focused in narrow areas we need to see it spread banyard is equally aware of the challenges at the moment while feminist organising is growing and really exciting its quite disparate and unconnected she says uk feminista is an attempt to address that issue for me whats absolutely crucial she continues is that we translate this excitement this energy into real gains for womens rights because its not an automatic translation we need fundamental shifts in our culture in our laws in business practices its not a simple process were very much at the stage now of creating a mass base of people whats crucial is that we then use that whats heartening is that feminism does seem to be reaching beyond the ivory towers of academe to a broad range of women redfern points out that there have recently been feminist articles in elle and company magazines while walter says she was surprised to see pieces debating the importance of feminism in the sunday times and the daily telegraph this year power says that even just a year and a half ago when she wrote one dimensional woman the situation didnt seem remotely as optimistic but so much has been happening and there just seems to be a mainstream acceptance that feminisms still around that its not finished its not uncool and its not depressing it suddenly has a contemporary sheen that makes it exciting which wasnt really true in the s or s at all shahida choudhry a yearold mother who lives in birmingham and has worked in the domestic violence sector throughout her career says that although a lot of her work has been driven by feminism its only recently that ive started to frame it like that in the past few years she has been heavily involved with the fawcett society in birmingham and is also the founder of the locally

millions of parents in the uk are being forced to cut their working hours or stop work altogether after having a second child according to a survey for aviva the cost of the sibling survey found that parents with two or more children are feeling the sibling squeeze the current average cost of fulltime childcare for two children is a year the survey found with this figure increasing in some areas such as innerlondon where the cost of a nursery can rise to a child a week childcare costs for children under two years of age can be even higher as a result many parents are deciding to cut their working hours to care for their children themselves after calculating they would be working purely to cover the cost of placing two or more children in childcare full time nearly six out of parents questioned for the survey said the main reason for cutting their working hours after the birth of their first child was to spend more time with their baby however after the birth of their second and subsequent children of parents said the main reason for reducing their hours was financial the study also found that of parents who cut their hours or did not return to work after the birth of their second child take at least five years off work until their children reach school age at this point parents who return to work often opt for flexible hours to fit in with the times their children are at school this fiveyear absence is potentially costing in lost earnings before factoring in the additional costs of supporting a second child one father of two children under the age of two who spoke to the guardian said childcare costs outweigh the income of a second parent working however we would still not place our children in childcare if it was cheaper it is the sacrifice we have made we would not want a nursery to see our children more than we do we decided that my wife would work from home and look after the children rather than pursuing a proper career she will return to work on a flexible basis once my eldest child is in school and my youngest in preschool,2010-07,million parent uk forced cut working hour stop work altogether second child according survey aviva cost sibling

the catholic writer piers paul read is currently plugging his new novel the misogynist i identify read by way of his religion because it has a bearing on his thesis that feminism is a joke inflicted on men by women which is being played back on its perpetrator i have no objections to the book fiction is as fiction does or rather i object only inasmuch as it would have been stronger without the gynophobia regarding festering vaginas what is shocking is that reads own feministbashing should go unremarked in an appearance on radio s front row the author confessed to grave misgivings about the movement its partly this feminist historicism which i think is false that women have been somehow oppressed by men throughout the ages you dont find any evidence of women being dissatisfied with their condition before the th century and then its just a few spoilt bluestockings and servants who get bored i think women saw it as the natural order that the man should be head of the family its also christian teaching and that they played this domestic role and i think the feminists stirred up a sense of resentment against men that persists today mark lawson usually no slouch as interviewer merely made the observation that a good many readers are women and yet read retorted the young women at his publishing house love the book i bet they do for it is a lamentable idiosyncrasy of feminism that unlike other rights movements the campaigns against prejudice based on race class or sexuality its beneficiaries take their emancipation and run many women will not even countenance the fword being prepared to concede only i wouldnt say im a feminist but but what that i like being paid an equal wage having the right not to get raped in marriage if read had argued that african americans knew where they stood under slavery and were well looked after there would justifiably be outrage how is it that misogyny somehow fails to qualify as hatred and why is it that women are prepared to be so passive in defence of their political interests the reason perhaps is that feminism is a movement that resists being confined to a canon instead of a marx it proposes a chorus a sorority an ongoing debate it is ideologically accommodating seeking not to exclude i am not your kind of feminist i once heard naomi wolf inform a woman and were not yours eyerolled the s sister next to me and yet this very inclusiveness can exclude those less attuned to the terms of the debate women dont know what theyre signing up for and what they dont feel part of they wont feel protective towards so when a malicious misreader such as read suggests that feminism is a bed trick to convince a man to grab her and fuck her and tell her to shut up both seem equally ho hum irrelevant reads book may be comic in intent but the real joke is that women are happy to enjoy the benefits of feminism without being prepared to own it defend it carry it forward in this sense at least he is right the joke is very much

sarka in comments to my piece about reform makes the very interesting point that much of what looks like or is denounced as misogyny is not so much an undervaluation or hatred of women as an overvaluation of men i dont think these men and some of the women who support them hate women exactly though they sure as hell hate women who step out of role its more that they adore men and masculinity on femo threads here at cif i have sometimes suggested that androphilia might be a better word than misogyny for some attitudes often men with conservative views genuinely dont think that they hate womenbut they are in love with their own masculinity she quotes the example of her own mother who left the church of england over women priests because she really thought there was something so splendid about being a priest that only a man could do it justice it is an idea worth hoicking up here for discussion among people who may be weary of homoeopathy and magic i think myself there is something in it and that you can distinguish between misogyny and androphilia even when both are found in the same man or woman for an example i would give you cs lewis whose misogyny seems to wax and wane with the state of his love life it more or less vanished once joy davidman found him but his androphilia was a lifelong condition,2010-07,sarka comment piece reform make interesting point much look like denounced misogyny much undervaluation hatred woman overvaluation men dont think men woman support hate woman exactly though sure hell hate woman step role adore men masculinity femo thread cif sometimes suggested androphilia might better word misogyny attitude often men conservative view genuinely dont think hate womenbut love masculinity quote example mother left church england woman priest really thought wa something splendid priest man could justice idea worth hoicking discussion among people may weary homoeopathy magic think something distinguish misogyny androphilia even found man woman example would give c lewis whose misogyny seems wax wane state love life less vanished joy davidman found androphilia wa lifelong condition,"['sarka', 'comment', 'piece', 'reform', 'make', 'interesting', 'point', 'much', 'look', 'like', 'denounced', 'misogyny', 'much', 'undervaluation', 'hatred', 'woman', 'overvaluation', 'men', 'dont', 'think', 'men', 'woman', 'support', 'hate', 'woman', 'exactly', 'though', 'sure', 'hell', 'hate', 'woman', 'step', 'role', 'adore', 'men', 'masculinity', 'femo', 'thread', 'cif', 'sometimes', 'suggested', 'androphilia', 'might', 'better', 'word', 'misogyny', 'attitude', 'often', 'men', 'conservative', 'view', 'genuinely', 'dont', 'think', 'hate', 'womenbut', 'love', 'masculinity', 'quote', 'example', 'mother', 'left', 'church', 'england', 'woman', 'priest', 'really', 'thought', 'wa', 'something', 'splendid', 'priest', 'man', 'could', 'justice', 'idea', 'worth', 'hoicking', 'discussion', 'among', 'people', 'may', 'weary', 'homoeopathy', 'magic', 'think', 'something', 'distinguish', 'misogyny', 'androphilia', 'even', 'found', 'man', 'woman', 'example', 'would', 'give', 'c', 'lewis', 'whose', 'misogyny', 'seems', 'wax', 'wane', 'state', 'love', 'life', 'less', 'vanished', 'joy', 'davidman', 'found', 'androphilia', 'wa', 'lifelong', 'condition']",59
the history of men pronouncing on women hasnt generally been a good one neither has the history of men pouncing on women but thats another story now martin amis has come forward again to state that the world would be a better place if it were ruled by females it is an absolutely great and marvellous and inevitable thing the rise of women he told a book festival last weekend and im now a sort of millenarian feminist men should be urging rights for women for the good of the species his view that women are the kinder less violent sex was endorsed by michael winner as anyone hoping to be taken seriously would want to be adding men are ridiculous women are far better people theyre also far better at washing socks and darning phew running the world and washing the socks thankfully as well as everything else women for it has been said regularly enough to stick excel at multitasking if amis hopes that women come to rule the world i wonder whether he has a particular type of woman in mind he has praised angela merkel for bringing feminine qualities to bear on the german economic and political crisis how about melanie phillips now theres a woman without a trace of those masculine qualities of anger or egodriven bias whose wisdom and analysis would bring peace to the middle east and halt the melting of the permafrost women possess superior values and qualities to men in much the same way that the noble savage possesses a superior form of wisdom untainted by education women are feminised whatever that means because they have been raised often with the best intentions and no shred of conscious application to be feminine and yet just as men raised to be masculine retain individual personalities all women are not the same lets take a moment to state the obvious if women appear to be kinder and less violent than men it is because their universally human capacities for cruelty and violence have historically had no outlet in the public sphere what is anorexia if not cruelty against your own body what is child neglect if not violence against someone less powerful than you when those capacities have had an outlet beyond the home such as in the magdalene laundries for single mothers which ran in ireland until the s the women in charge havent raised hand to brow and wailed but im a woman im too kind to be cruel the nuns who ran them didnt beat and bully the girls in order to impress or outdo men they did it because they could exercise power without rebuke most women manage to live successfully without being consumed by rage at their historic lack of power they may become depressed or at least report becoming depressed at a higher rate than men and attempt suicide more often but like most humans they find ways to prevail over their circumstances it is no easier no more natural for women to be kind and thoughtful than it is for men simply that it is often the only sanctioned behaviour for women who wish to avoid being regarded as mad what the novelist hilary mantel calls the choking knotweed of miscommunication in domestic life exists as much among women as it does between women and men it misses the point entirely to take a view of human potential which limits and defines the qualities of individuals according to which group they belong while disregarding the social conditions in which those qualities were forced into prominence in any case for men to demand that women save them from themselves is somewhat rich men or at least middle and upperclass men have had free rein on civilising activities for a lot longer than women the vote literacy higher education their own money if were to regard women as a single political block rather than as individuals who make up of the population scattered throughout the class structure then surely a more pressing matter for discussion is how women with money treat women with less its not as though the feminist movement has truly benefited women beyond those who felt it beneath them to raise their own children interesting how the right to work claimed by many educated mothers often translates into my right to do an interesting and wellpaid job while some other woman changes my childs nappy or cleans my house or washes irons and folds my dirty clothes for an hour for this reason and many others i dont believe in women taking over i believe in everyone taking over more specifically i believe that class cuts across gender and race the philosopher mary midgley who attributes much of her success to the fact that she was educated during the war when the men were away fighting has suggested that in normal times a lot of good female thinking is wasted because it simply doesnt get heard for good female thinking we can substitute good thinking and get closer to the rub,2010-07,history men

i know exactly where i was a year ago it was sunny and very warm but there was also a strong breeze blowing through trafalgar square at least there was if you were standing on top of a plinth one of people picked at random from a list of registered names i was among those lucky enough to take part in antony gormleys one amp other project the idea as you probably remember was to create a living changing statue in the middle of a formal london square to make an artwork that might build up a picture of contemporary life or perhaps just a picture of the kind of people who can imagine themselves standing alone above their fellow citizens for an hour my date was july bastille day and so as a way of making it more entertaining not to mention as a bit of a disguise i dressed up as marie antoinette in the revolutionary spirit i held up slogans culled from a variety of radical movements and i gave out free cake to those who gathered to watch but it was more than a slice of cake to me it was my little slice of history and a moment of actually being involved in an artistic endeavour for once rather than just writing about them so it was a bit upsetting for me to read yesterday of all days how comparatively few women are professionally engaged in the broader arts scene research released by the new campaigning group uk feminista reveals some statistics that though i already halfsuspected them to be true are sad to see in print for instance of performances at glastonbury this summer were by allmale acts and of the conductors and of the composers featured in the forthcoming bbc proms are women when it comes to visual art of the artists nominated for the turner prize so far are men and of the work showing in tate modern is by men we already know that film and tv suffer from similar problems both behind and in front of the camera with two male tv parts available across the industry for every one female role and with the pool of film directors containing just of women but in an area like writing where it is harder to explain the dominance of men the figures are still disturbing according to uk feminista only of those who are shortlisted for the samuel johnson prize are men and only of the winners of the bafta award for the best screenplay have been women the only source of consolation is the man booker the awards figures are not quite as bad with

many parents are ticking off the last few days of the school summer holidays next year the condem government wants to put single parents with children over five years back into work along with a further currently on benefits which they say will save m how with job cuts including by in the public sector alone its a given that there arent enough jobs for the parents to go to a far more pressing issue is that far fewer jobs paying a reasonable wage are possible within school hours gingerbreads changing the workplace report found that of parents had seen no or few jobs advertised for hours within school hours and could not find jobs with any degree of flexibility primary school practices curtail working parents time and again by ensuring that school holidays and wrap around childcare are untenable with working hours the coalition has failed to address the issue of the weeks of school holidays spread throughout the year with two parents taking an average four weeks annual leave separately from each other it is impossible with a single parent it is simply unworkable the daycare trust found only of local authorities could provide enough holiday childcare this year with a postcode lottery on costs per child depending on the region one newly single mother told me shed love to get a job but shed have to leave every july to do the summer childcare as there wasnt any on offer the added costs of holiday care for weeks and wraparound care was too much to bear how could she possibly sustain a job the key to solving the working parent versus primary schools issue is a threepronged strategy first is immediate school holiday reform thirteen weeks holidays a year is a legacy of generations where there was always a parent at home usually the mother this isnt the case anymore and employees holiday leave doesnt and cant match it the second solution is childcare for primary school pupils to be immediately and radically reformed in terms of finance and hours to reflect the needs of the parents who want to work based on the swedish model for childcare contributions should be capped at of the families income replacing the current hours of free childcare per week for three and fouryearolds hours of childcare in this age range alone benefits very few that tax credits can also cover the cost of up to of childcare will always be a step in the right direction though tax credit reform is now looking decidedly shaky for many families except for those who gingerbreads report found still cant afford the remaining even if they can find appropriate childcare that can take their child to school and collect at home time wrap around childcare must be made available on site at all primary schools including holiday care whether that provision is operated by the school or franchised out by the local authority let me point out the obvious here with existing work hours almost always am to pm and schools hours typically am to pm parents cannot commute to work in time and are not able to leave to collect their children during term time the solution is for flexible working practices enshrined in legislation all employees should be offered the opportunity to work from home especially when a child is sick or to choose hours they can fit around child obligations where the work doesnt require them to be on site the exceptions being professions such as doctors nurses teachers builders this will ensure parents can work and are not excluded from work before theyve even secured an interview and not penalised in terms of wages or promotion when work is secured some will be tempted to say people shouldnt have children if they cant afford the childcare or be at home for their children during the school holidays themselves its a lazy argument akin to saying people shouldnt have children full stop if reforms arent made the coalitions message to parents is clear on paper we want you to work but in practice good luck with that

when tony blair took paternity leave in he saw a dip in his approval ratings the likelihood now is that david camerons ratings would have suffered if he had opted not to take leave more is expected of fathers these days and fathers expect more of themselves at the fatherhood institute we recently polled mums and dads and found that with only a few exceptions they aspired to an equal sharing of parenting roles and yet we still dont seem to have reached the tipping point of change that would create real options for parents wanting to share their parenting employers still assume it is their female staff who will take time off work to look after their families while men who want to be more involved with their children face an uphill struggle to carve out such a path i recently addressed a room of financial services professionals when i asked how many of them had changed to flexible working hours since they became a parent just one hand went up it belonged to the only woman in the room the increased amount of time todays fathers spend with their children comes at the expense of their leisure time rather than their work for fathers rushing from the office to bathtime worklife strains can be severe and damaging not just for the men themselves but also for their families and the unequal sharing of caring is a big driver of the gender pay gap if workplaces have been slow to allow men to be fathers it is largely because they are following rules set by government we still have a leave system which assumes the mother will take responsibility for childcare during the first months while fathers are ushered back to work after only two weeks and even then these two weeks of paternity leave are paid at such a low level that almost half of families cannot afford to use it the last months of the labour government saw the enactment of the additional paternity leave regulations which from april will allow a mother to return to work after six months and the father to use the remaining six months of her maternity leave both parties in the coalition promised to go much further but this agenda seems in danger of going into reverse ideas for helping couples to share their parenting have not resurfaced since the election and the department for business innovation and skills has opened up a review into shared parental leave promising to look at it with a fresh pair of eyes theresa may has hinted that labours additional paternity leave might be shelved or scrapped altogether such a reluctance to get to grips with a dysfunctional leave system is not in tune with the

last sunday afternoon two dozen women and their supporters converged on venice beach california for a very unusual demonstration all the women were topless while the men sported bikini tops the march was organised by gotopless a us campaign for women to have the same constitutional right to be barechested in public places as men its members are committed to helping women perceive their breasts as noble natural parts of their anatomy and the demonstration had been organised for late august apparently not just because of the hot weather but to make a feminist point campaigners noted that it was in august that women in the us were given the right to vote and even in the st century women need to stand up and demand that equality in fact not just in words this isnt the first time those unlikely bedfellows feminism and bare breasts have gone together at feminist fundraisers i organised in the early s women would often whip off their tops and dance wildly to free nelson mandela while arguing that womens bodies should be unbound from the constraints of male objectification many a time i had my pint spilt by a swinging bosom then there is the michigan womens music festival an annual event attended by the knit your own tampon crowd many of whom go naked to demonstrate that womens bodies are natural and beautiful i have a friend who once strolled up to pornographer hugh hefner naked and forced him to shake her hand as part of her antiporn protest he was apparently terrified is the gotopless campaign really feminist though it emphasises that men should be able to control themselves and show respect when confronted with a bare breast in public and highlights the fact that while men are able to walk around almost naked women have to cover up but the campaigns mission statement also argues that feminism has resulted in women repressing our femininity which is apparently a powerful asset as we struggle for equal rights in a masculinedominated world many men support gotopless but not all because they believe in equal rights a number were seen on the protest ogling the topless women and taking photos and film footage on mobile phones something tells me that get your tits out for equal rights will never become a feminist mantra,2010-08,last sunday afternoon two dozen woman supporter converged venice beach california unusual demonstration woman topless men sported

as a proud lesbian feminist i have campaigned for years against the beauty industry and cosmetic surgery i have never worn makeup except once as an experiment for these pages and for years i even refused to wear a bra until i had to dress up in vaguely smart clothing occasionally for work but we all have an achilles heel and mine is facial hair i hate it both on myself and other women i have a particular terror of fuzz appearing on my face and always carry one lone item of beauty equipment tweezers luckily i am not particularly afflicted although in recent years i have noticed one long black hair that sprouts from my left cheek another under my chin and a few barely noticeable ones above my lip the second they appear they are instantly torn asunder my fear of the fuzz is hardly unusual even in the thick of the late s womens movement i remember a close friend a fellow lesbian and hardline feminist confessing im so glad i discovered electrolysis before feminism not everyone shares our prejudices a whiskerspride movement has been growing in recent years across the web there are women writing about their heartfelt acceptance of their moustaches and beards including debra ann beechy who has written a doctoral thesis on the topic my mornings used to involve at least an hour of plucking in front of a lighted magnified mirror she writes now i do not have to get up early to pluck elation over the past two months a feminist activist in bristol called jessica burton has been running a campaign called hairy awarey asking women all over the land to go natural ive been hairy for so long that it just seems normal to me says burton but i do feel that at the moment women do not have a choice about hair i suppose the excitement about hairy awarey was that the simplest of actions leaving the razor on the side of the bath tub can have lifechanging effects for the women brave enough to try it the logic of hairy awarey is that if enough of us give up the tweezers the sight of body and facial hair on women will be normalised and any stigma will eventually disappear but is it really that easy if a hardline antigrooming feminist such as me has an aversion to excess hair how many women are really going to embrace it some already do shazia mirza the comedian and columnist grew her body hair over a period of seven months for a bbc documentary called fuck off im a hairy woman at first i thought i wouldnt be able to do it she says as i was obsessed with hair removal having had a hitler moustache since i was seven but actually it was very easy having body hair is the most natural thing we are all hairy and it is a myth that men like hairfree women after the programme i had thousands of emails from men who said they much prefer hairy women but they cant say that in public because lads mags tell them they have to like a hairfree abi titmuss lisa spirulina a lesbian of indian heritage tells me she is proud of her moustache spirulinas dark skin obscured her facial hair until it became more abundant in her late teens so i got away without being bullied at school about it she says now i am proud of my hairy lip i sit playing with it when i am thinking or watching tv del la grace volcano formerly known as the lesbian photographer della grace grew her goatee beard in the late s to much media consternation i lived for a year with a beard before i decided to take testosterone not to be seen as a man but to make my intersexness visible she says it was rough always getting negative vibes from people knowing they were judging you andor uncomfortable i know quite a few women who have facial hair and are happy about it i know more women who are ashamed and bothered by it she says that all the women she knows who feel empowered by their facial hair identify as lesbians an estimated of all women naturally grow facial hair and the campaign we can face it was launched in june backed by dr dawn harper from the channel series embarrassing bodies it aims to create a supportive community for women with unwanted hair according to a survey of women carried out as part of the campaign of women with unwanted facial hair suffer clinical depression a quarter believe facial hair has held them back from promotion and more than say it has affected their ability to form relationships most women selftreat the problem by tweezing or shaving and the only body hair most women like is their eyelashes and eyebrows the we can face it survey found almost all the respondents felt negative about their facial hair with more than half feeling anxious to very anxious if it was visible and couldnt be removed immediately two thirds said it made them feel unfeminine female facial hair has a number of causes aside from hereditary factors it can also be caused by an excess of certain testosteronerelated hormones or polycystic ovary syndrome pos jessica karjala discovered she had pos after being alerted to the fact that a sudden facial sprouting can be a symptom of the disease when i experienced an increase in facial hair it was coarser and thicker than usual she says and i removed it out of vanity i chalked it up to middle age or perimenopause i wish i had known that my increase in facial hair was an early symptom of a harmful hormone imbalance regardless of your comfort level in regards to your appearance that knowledge could prevent serious future health problems philippa willetts also has excess facial hair as a result of pos and says she wants to be less horrified by it ive known some women with more facial hair than most who looked fantastic and i envy them their confidence years ago when i started gaining weight also as a result of pos and was unhappy about it a friend said i was also judging other fat women i agree and think it is the same with facial hair if i hate it on me i must hate it on other women we have no idea how many women grow hair on their face because the vast majority will pluck it out i talk to all my friends about other beauty issues but this is a big secret between us women can grow more accepting of their facial hair with time julia long a feminist academic in her s says she started to grow a bit of a tache when i was when i hit puberty at school i would be bullied by the boys who made me feel horrible about myself she decided to undergo electrolysis after reading a magazine article about it but her gp told her she would have to wait until two years after puberty if she wanted it to be effective two years to the day i started the treatment she says it was agony and left me with a ribenacoloured rash on my face that was more noticeable than the hair so is it possible to free ourselves from this prejudice in italy there is a famous saying donna barbuta sempre piaciuta everyone loves a woman with a beard could that be the case in britain burton hopes so she plans to make hairy awarey an annual campaign and after spending hundreds of pounds on bleach wax and creams over the years long has now decided to let her hair grow maybe its because i am and men look at me less but i feel so much better now i am letting it all grow out,2010-08,proud lesbian feminist campaigned year

the chartered management institute the mail which has a complex sometimes abusive relationship with its women readers predicts that the findings will outrage millions of women executives who say they work as hard or harder than men its stock prediction in most circumstances the guardians account is calmer and more nuanced as you would expect but it shares the mails and the cmi research teams dismay fortyodd years after barbara castles equal pay act women still earn on average something between and figures seem to vary of what men earn it was around in castles heyday so there is progress and if you want to be more positive are we sure we do we might note that the gap has narrowed slightly in britain in the past year since womens salaries increased by an average against for blokes oddly enough the cmi report also suggests that the pay gap is lowest in the northeast exactly the opposite of what women friends from the north would expect such data usually provides a less than clear picture different sectors have different habits the cmi says it and pharmaceuticals are particularly bad for women though presumably not as bad as coalmining the mails report notes that cranfield universitys annual female ftse report suggests of major firms still have allmale boards compared with a decade ago just of ftse board directors are women and so on the eternal question is whether this is just about sexism im sure its partly so though even that point is not straightforward for example from what we constantly hear from the financial sector investment banking the crowd who got us all into economic trouble is very male in its attitudes and pay structures women bankers win employment cases on pay and harassment but then investment banking must be a very testosteronedriven activity which requires relaxation in lapdancing clubs expensive motors and other toys for boys a lifestyle that cant have much appeal for sensible women so the nature of the work banking or coalmining may be a factor even a cursory glance at google suggests that hours worked are also a likely factor men tend to put in more hours at work a detail that leads to the old familiar core issue women are both inclined andor obliged to make their families a greater priority in the worklife balance equation why should this prompt the mail to demand that its executive readers feel outraged women arent obliged to make that choice any more either by societys dictates women teachers and civil servants were obliged to resign when they got marriedpregnant well within living memory or by lack of control over their own fertility they can work and use childminders parent minders too and they can let their partner stay at home while they become the no breadwinner an increasingly visible choice they can choose not to have children andor family a choice giving australias welshborn pm julia gillard problems in her election campaign this week though it is not oz labors only problem good luck julia all of which strikes me as progress to be welcomed along with jobsharing it seems to work well flexitime and all the other improvements made in womens working lives largely the achievement of labour governments incidentally its good to see the toryled coalition finally catching up after the laggard thatchermajor years but we cant duck the fact that many women choose to put kids or less easily elderly parents first i read in sundays observer another article that behavioural differences between the sexes are not hardwired at birth but are the results of pervasive cultural forces say scientists ok if you say so scientists but i look forward to next sundays edition where other scientists may disagree a woman doctor with whom i discussed it this week reckons its nature over nurture which is certainly consistent with my observations over the years and why not of course a lot of things are tough on women who still despite all that progress do more than their share of housework despite in many cases working for a living too but they still live significantly longer than their menfolk a fact that would cause a lot more media outrage if the highheeled boot were on the other foot of course education makes these sort of choices easier too more good news on this front as well womens share of university places has shot up dramatically as such places have expanded in the decades since the castle legislation theyre a majority in many places now yes its the unskilled working class those failing boys we read about who have lost out to middle class girls as a result though its rarely expressed quite that way interestingly enough the cmis current remedy like that of the fawcett society and similar lobbies is greater transparency in the publication of pay data its something harriet harman was keen to promote and the coalition is thinking about having already shown itself keen to expose public sector fat cats on nongender grounds for reasons of its own i was initially hostile to that campaign since it seemed likely to foment jealousy a fairly useless emotion but its revealed so many extraordinary salaries many not all pretty hard to explain that ive changed my mind even the coalitions new low pay guru will hutton turned out to be taking home gross from the work foundation charity which seemed a bit steep for a chap with other jobs if were heading that way it would be nice to see transparency extended into corners of the private sector where the realities of pay and perks often remain quite well hidden inside annual reports so gender comparisons might as well be in the mix even if they cost time and money to ascertain as they will but dont assume the results will all delight the fawcett society after all economic rationalists who

how many feminists does it take to change a lightbulb having studied at an allgirls school for most of my life it was always amazing that the punchline to this joke was almost always guaranteed a laugh even at a school dedicated to the advancement of african women in postcolonial kenya the idea of feminism appeared to translate to radicalism and images of braburning rallies so if someone told me two years ago that i would be wading into a discussion on the label feminism i would probably have laughed in their face being called a feminist was usually a setup to a disparaging observation about the state of ones personal life for instance wangari maathai the first kenyan to win the nobel prize and long recognised as a feminist and hailed as a heroine in the west was received in kenya in a manner that can best be described as lukewarm yet kenyan women are believed to be among the most liberated certainly on the african continent according to the united nations development programme undp using measures of development adjusted to account for gender only of countries for which statistics are available outperform kenya with regards to gender parity in development this implies that the average kenyan woman is more likely to be educated and to a higher level than many of her african and indeed global counterparts similarly in kenya femaleheaded enterprises from large distilleries and multimilliondollar megachurches to tiny stalls selling vegetables are not unusual so how could a country where women are able to achieve so much have such an ambiguous relationship with an empowering label the kenyan situation is not unusual in many parts of the global south women are rejecting the baggage that comes with western feminism i believe this has to do with how it has defined what women want and how to go about getting it this is hardly a new criticism for decades minority women have argued that western feminism is the preserve of white middleclass women and does not fight the battles of women with other racial or economic backgrounds qualified feminism thirdworld feminism postcolonial feminism chicana feminism emerged as a rejection of this homogenising approach to liberation as many women felt that their double burden gender as well as racial or economic was being overlooked in the modern world economics has for the most part supplanted race as the primary basis for exclusion and discrimination in all societies and while western feminists have by and large succeeded in achieving a substantial level of social and economic freedom their counterparts in other parts of the world continue to struggle in the democratic republic of congo described as rape capital of the world women are not only suffering unequal access to education or economic empowerment they also suffer significant threats to their personal security on a daily basis because of a war fought primarily between men for these women rage against religion for instance seems hollow and distracting as that is often the only institution that will stay and rebuild long after the government and the un and other civil society actors have moved on the priorities of western and developing world feminists differ even in countries where the threat of imminent war is absent the economic oppression of women by patriarchal economic institutions persists the economist noted that in burundi women are the social and economic powerhouses of their society sustaining their families with apparently nothing more than a tenacious desire to see their children do better however they are still forbidden from inheriting land and many are exposed to the threat of beatings or rape in bangladesh the vast majority of the workers in the export processing zones are women yet the cost of being the engines for the economic growth of their country is that women are more likely to be uneducated in bangladesh than in just about any other south asian country nonetheless these feminisms are not diametrically opposed all feminism has so far proven itself better at identifying oppression than in identifying freedom and it is in this gap that the debates arise to western feminists freedom has come to mean among other things sexual liberation try to transpose a similar approach to other parts of the world and youll find that most women see this as another form of sexual exploitation and oppression pointing out that true freedom involves the freedom from sexualisation these positions while miles apart are not irreconcilable both inherently recognise that some form of social oppression is denying women the right to exist as whole human beings rather than purely sexual or asexual objects this desire for a holistic appreciation of womanhood is the true essence of feminism and an excellent place to begin in bringing the disparate schools of feminism back on the same page it is in the interests of all feminists to reject oppression as defined by those who experience it rather than focusing on pointing fingers or claiming superiority over other groups how many feminists does it take to change a lightbulb it doesnt matter as long as we all recognise that the lightbulb needs

what does it take these days to inspire women to selfhate not only to selfhate but to take it to such industrial levels that they are manufacturing their own misogyny last week it took a study by wwwukjobsnet which interviewed men and women finding that threequarters of men preferred to work for male bosses twothirds of women agreed their reasons were that men were more straight talking and reasonable less bitchy cliquey and prone to mood swings and this one made me laugh less likely to feel threatened if others were good at their jobs yeah thats what ive noticed about men too theyre so noncompetitive another reason didnt make me laugh in the same way that roy chubby brown doesnt make me laugh this said the reason male bosses were better was no time of the month so here we have it is it your time of the month darlin that cliche is churned out whenever a woman is annoyed or upset its the staple womanslamming riposte of s sitcoms usually followed by a gale of canned laughter here it was immortalised in workplace lore as a bona fide reason why male bosses are better more depressing presumably at least some women in the survey were happy to go along with it perhaps i should feel cheated that no woman i ever worked for suddenly started bawling about men troubles bitchslapping colleagues or involving me in the intimate workings of their menstrual cycle for the record here are some of my experiences of working for women they asked me to do something i did it they said thanks a little later they asked me to do something else i did it they said thanks and so on a bit monotonous isnt it or should i say professional uncomplicated normal enjoyable in fact strangely similar to the vast majority of my experiences with male bosses this is the point the boss thing is not a gender issue it is a personality issue or if you really want to get brutal an arsehole issue some people can cope with having power over others others be they male or female should never have been given it if gender comes into it at all it is as an afterthought a preference the sprinkle of hundreds and thousands on your workinglife ice cream sundae some people prefer their own sex because of the gender shorthand and intimacy it sometimes brings others prefer the opposite sex precisely because of a presumed sense of difference and distance none of this matters more than this question this boss of yours is he or she a complete arsehole or not whats depressing about this survey is that the catalogue of reasons why women do not make such good bosses is effectively a list of why anyone male or female would be bad at wielding power yet somehow these are defined and presented as female traits so it is that before theyve even reached their desks and fished out a ballpoint women bosses are being branded trashed dreaded and judged by men and more worryingly other women this goes beyond this survey if any women comes out with no time of the month as a reason for preferring a male boss not only should they be ashamed but they should be aware where this selfhatred leads are you telling me that these kinds of attitudes do not subliminally leak into everyday work culture leading to more pressure on female bosses less likelihood of females becoming bosses less respect for female workers across the board is this the working world that twothirds of women really want lets hope not while were all aware of the glass ceiling it becomes a whole new issue if it is other women calling in the glaziers face it becks you are too old so precisely how indignant should we feel on behalf of david beckham and his brutal too old dumping by england manager fabio capello during a press conference well a little but thats your lot capellos crime was one of manners before making any public statement he should have personally called beckham and said sorry youre out and it has nothing to do with the fact that you got right on my nerves hanging around like a spare part in the dugout during the world cup capello was right after south africa i felt that i could play for england but joking apart no player including beckham has a preordained right to be in the squad remember the uproar when glenn hoddle left paul gascoigne out of the england squad then come the matches and it was all ooh michael owen and everyone forgot about indispensable gazza as for the age jibe again capello is right beckham may be one smokinghot papa on billboards selling underpants but he is footballers like other professional sports people have a notoriously short shelf life at their peak they exploit this very fact to get huge wages their argument being i only have a limited amount of time to make money out of this so pay up fair enough fill those studded boots but then they cant act all surprised and hurt when their much trumpeted limited shelf life turns out to be a reality beckham can continue to play the martyr refusing to play a goodbye friendly and insisting chin jutting mistyeyed that he is still available to play for england the heart is with him but the head is not capello lacked manners and sensitivity but he was also right fewer of those diva demands please mr blair no photographs no mobile phones no personal dedications tony blairs demands for his book signings for a journey are reminiscent of the contracts of diva film stars where crew members and other mere mortals are not allowed to talk to them or even look them in the eye tony blair is ready for his close up mr waterstone he should be aware that the public is bored with selfjustifying new labour memoirs which are

the summer holidays cause childcare headaches for working families across the uk but employed lone parents are probably finding these six long weeks more stressful than most as they struggle to balance childcare and employment and the number of single parents desperately looking for extra childcare during holiday periods is set to increase the coalition government has declared that from october lone parents on income support must when their youngest child reaches the age of five actively seek work or take up a job or lose up to of their benefits compelling single parents to seek work is not a new policy the previous government was preparing to introduce a similar measure for parents when their children reached the age of seven but the new policy announced in junes emergency budget is more draconian the government estimates that it will affect single parents in and save m between then and the governments theory is that work is the best route out of poverty and that it is reasonable to expect parents of schoolage children to seek paid employment no such compulsion however has been announced for parents who are couples and living on benefits the lone parents policy will particularly affect women since they account for nine out of single parents the prime ministers own poverty adviser labour mp frank field has said that the government should shift from its obsession with pushing mothers into work and instead remove the benefits received by unmarried unemployed fathers who refuse job offers gingerbread a charity supporting lone parents says it hears from both mothers and fathers who say they would like a job but cannot see how to juggle work commitments with the inevitable unpredictability involved in being the sole carer of their children for those single parents who do work one of the biggest problems is sustaining their employment during the long summer holiday says rhodri thomas spokesman at reed in partnership a private company that operates voluntary employment support programmes for single parents most parents are reluctant to leave their children in childcare for long periods of time says thomas then theres the of childcare costs they have to find tax credits pay for up to lisa walter a mother of four who lives in essex says that being forced back to work is deeply unfair on both her and her children i dont like being stereotyped ive paid tax and national insurance since i was ive gone back to work after having my first two children and ive loved my jobs its not like im workshy single parents she points out do not generally ask to be in their situation and my children didnt ask to be put in afterschool clubs and looked after by other people wendi new who is living in yorkshire after experiencing a traumatic relationship breakdown says she would like to work but the problem is fitting it in with the needs of twoyearold hollie how would i feel if i have to go back to work when she hits five and starts school i think it could be quite tough on her becoming a latchkey kid at five would be hard it would be bad enough when shes older and then in school holidays thered be that frantic search for childcare that i had once before when her childminder went on holiday hollies had a lot of changes and i dont want endless childcare for her she needs stability now anne longfield chief executive of the charity children says there is sufficient childcare out there for probably one in five children that means there isnt any for one in four she says and thats in term time when it gets to school holidays theres a lot less particularly as your child gets older jane connolly from gloucestershire whose partner left her has serious concerns about the impact on her yearold daughter of being packed off to afterschool and holiday childcare to enable her to hold down a job especially when she makes the big transition from primary to secondary school parenting is not just earning money to look after children i as a parent and she as a child want me there at the end of her day she needs that domestic environment where you are together as a family lone parents may already be coping with the painful aftermath of a relationship breakup and feeling emotionally stretched as they try to compensate their children for the loss of a parent says kate bell head of policy at gingerbread add to that the pressure of being compelled to look for work when they may have been out of the workplace for some years the anxiety involved in coming off benefits when they are uncertain whether a job will work out plus the strain of having to negotiate time off with their employer if a child is ill and the result is tens of thousands of very fearful people barely managing daisy rawlins from surrey and mother of three children under six started work in may last year but had to stop in september because her employer said there was not enough work for her they havent reinstated my income support or housing benefit yet so im living on child benefit and luckily because my daughter is classified disabled she gets disability living allowance and i get carers allowance were a family of four im barely managing she says the effect on benefits when lone parents do take up work is problematic theres quite a narrow band in which single parents are better off in work if a single parent chooses to work extra hours their benefits can be hit quite steeply thomas says it is this kind of financial black hole that often makes single parents terrified of dipping a toe in the workplace proposals from the work and pensions secretary iain duncan smith to put in place a transitional phaseout of benefits when a person gets a job rather than a sudden stop are a necessity says longfield changes to housing benefit could also hit lone parents hard a year on from being transferred to jobseekers allowance if someone has failed to find work is deducted from their housing benefit thats the one that will really cut into income because the parent can do all the right things make themselves available for work and still lose of housing benefit says anne begg labour chair of the commons work and pensions select committee the departments work and pensions own calculations are that only of people will get jobs and yes they have to take jobs if theyre offered but if there are no jobs they wont be offered one it could leave their children homeless says begg where all the shorthours schoolholiday friendly jobs are to come from is another concern although weve seen an increase in flexible work a lot of that was in the public sector and thats where the cuts are going to bite hardest says kate green a labour mp and former chief executive of the child poverty action group a recent study by gingerbread covering a twoweek period showed that of jobs advertised in london papers had no flexibility were parttime and none were offered as school hours jobs walter wonders how flexible employers are really willing or able to be if one child is sick i might need two or three days off to look after them theres no one to share that with and with more children that could easily be multiplied unless i take holiday thats unpaid time so how stable is that job really even if you do find one thats flexible out of pocket what would mitigate single parents fears and make holding down a job possible i dont actually think its practical to work and care on my own for three children says rawlins id be out of pocket would lose valuable quality time with my children and i couldnt do a fulltime job using my qualifications because they dont come with flexibility connolly adds you need to be able to limit your job search to within a realistic response time to your childs main place of care because theres only you to go to them if theres a crisis fully funded childcare would lessen the burden says walter but wouldnt remove it and then for the government to meet the cost of losing pay if you have to care for a sick child because in my situation there is nobody else to do that she adds with four children being a mum on your own is a fulltime job without going out to work forcing the issue currently single parents on jobseekers allowance may refuse a job for the first six months if it does not fit their qualifications or does not leave them better off after that if a job is offered they have to take it and says gingerbread nothing in the existing legislation says a single parent must be better off being in work than on benefits under the new policy from their childs fifth birthday single parents will be switched from income support to jsa they will be required to work a minimum of hours a week if their youngest child is aged or under they can restrict their work hours to school hours and would not be forced to take up a job outside those hours,2010-08,summer holiday cause childcare headache working family across uk employed lone parent probably finding six long week

hetero and male is out homo and female is in or so the fear goes ah summertime a season of sundappled beaches and artificial insemination movies the arrival of the backup plan the kids are all right and the forthcoming the switch indicates more than a minor rustling of cultural anxiety by gesturing towards a certain kind of independence for women that they can bypass romantic partnerships with men when having babies while still limiting their characters to many of the reductive romantic comedy conventions these films illustrate the conflicted state of feminism masculinism and the couple in the st century yet the kids are all right scheduled for an october release in britain marches to a slightly different beat the real inconvenient truth of our time is not climate change but the confusion that comes with shifting gender roles thanks to these sexual category adjustments we now live in a time when the atlantic can publish an article entitled the end of men that charts womens social ascendancy even as much of the same old sexism is circulating a time that some label postfeminist while others say there is still so much work to be done summer films are generally thought to be silly and escapist and sperm donor flicks certainly offer the goofy quotient but they struggle to deliver the escapism because they inevitably come up against a masculine hysteria about mens end or more precisely the fear that all ladies now need is their seed this is especially true of movies that deal with reproductive technology as it relates to lesbian partnership as in the case of the kids are all right its important to note that a whiff of male inadequacy hovers around the whole process although there are many situations in which ai is used including on farm animals the main function it serves is to a supplement a heterosexual relationship in which the male is infertile or b in scenarios where there isnt a man in the picture to begin with this places it firmly in the insecurity zone of the psychic map of masculinity these films foreground and dramatise a psychologically and biologically horrifying prospect for men the fragmentation of their manhood both literally and figuratively their masculine presence is no longer required and the semen that comes with it can just be harvested from their bodies and used by others in a way that neither benefits nor includes them its not surprising that for the sake of male egos everywhere these movies appear to pitch a kind of sexual selfservice situation for the ladies but then subsequently revoke that offer although they threaten to take the men out of the mix altogether they ultimately ease up on that threat clearly the recent surge of reproductive technology has raised the spectre of the abolition of men being men and women being women particularly in their having standard babymaking relations given the romantic intricacies of this age of metrosexuality retrosexuality and the advancement of women gay rights and samesex marriage social change has to be acknowledged and assimilated to some degree the kids are all right is revolutionary in that it highlights a real as in flawed but clearly functional example of successful samesex coupledom and recognises an alternative type of motherhood in a country whose president doesnt believe in it and where there have been a number of efforts to define matrimony as strictly hetero such as the recently overturned proposition like the backup plan and the switch the kids are all right does insert a man between the two women in a lastditch attempt to repair the image of male sexual fragmentation but unlike them it also takes him out in the end that is a ringing final verdict on samesex love and by extension on the viability of women living full lives without

its not simply the martinis and the misogyny that date james bond his gender is just so pass a survey of british graduates reveals that women are more tempted by a career in espionage than their male counterparts they are also keen on the police working in a prison and the probation service options that dont even feature in the mens top preferred employers the guardian uk the largest ever overview of uk employers and their potential graduate recruits suggests that while the professional ambitions of male and female graduates are converging women still appear to have significantly different priorities the survey confirms and confounds prejudices simultaneously says steve james of targetjobs which carried out the research men show a bias towards science and itbased professions whereas women are much more into the public sector which surprised me some graduates were asked to name the companies they would most like to work for although the big beasts such as pricewaterhousecoopers deloitte and glaxosmithkline rank high on both wishlists teachfirst the charity that fasttracks top graduates into the classrooms of underperforming schools was the second choice of women whereas it trailed at number for men in third place for women was the nhs graduate scheme rated th by men the women questioned also revealed a pronounced social conscience a fifth of their named employers are charities good works make up only of male ambitions the obvious conclusion is that stereotypes are resistant to progress despite three years of academic rigour women are still guided by the nurturing instinct whereas men pursue big bucks preethi sundaram policy and campaigns officer for the gender equality campaign group the fawcett society reckons the truth is more complicated there is still perhaps a strong sense that certain fields offer a lack of flexibility when it comes to worklife balance the world of high finance for example she says despite more progressive companies efforts there is a perception that some sectors are not for those that want to combine work and family life she reckons that if more companies offered shared parental leave and flexible working practices career stereotypes would soon dissolve half of teachfirst participants regard their stint in the classroom as a chance to gain the leadership and diplomacy skills for use in a totally different profession including finance and accountancy in reality most career paths are determined at school when pupils select their subjects technology firms such as ibm and apple crowd the mens top but dont make it into the female top this could be because girls are not choosing stem subjects at school says jamie oconnell marketing director of the student networking site the student room women still make up only

switzerland is now governed by a majority of women but is this a historic moment for the country the revolution would appear to be only superficial switzerland is actually pretty conservative two new ministers have been elected to the swiss federal council johann schneiderammann and simonetta sommaruga with these two newcomers it is now four women and three men who hold the fate of switzerland in their hands the government represents the main political forces in the country from the nationalist right to the socialist left including the centreright with the countrys presidency in the hands of doris leuthard in who will be replaced in by micheline calmyrey swiss politics is increasingly femaleled we now join finland norway spain and cape verde among the countries with a femaledominated government climbing to second place behind finland which holds the record with women out of ministers switzerland shines with a score of and it could have been even higher as another woman was very narrowly defeated on september five out of seven women really would have kickstarted a huge debate the day after the historic election the swiss press remained relatively moderate in its praise only mentioning a halfvictory but the progress made is real switzerland isnt known to be a good student in terms of gender equality and promoting women to key positions we only granted the right to vote to women in and women from the very conservative cantons of appenzell rhodesintrieures had to wait until to vote locally and were only given this promotion via a court verdict in the first female federal councillor elisabeth kopp was elected for the following five years the swiss government comprised one woman working with six men kopp eventually had to resign for having intervened in a court case concerning her husband in the federal council once again became entirely male it took until for a new woman to join the government ruth dreifuss became president of the confederation in the first woman to attain such a position in december federal councillor ruth metzler lost her reelection once again leaving only one woman in government activists went on to organise a vigil next to the government buildings to express their disapproval starting on march international womens day the vigil saw women taking turns for days as for the swiss parliament is still remains maledominated only of the elected officials are women and in the swiss business world women are still rarely found in positions of power even if business tycoons like nayla hayek enjoy a lot of publicity hayek succeeded her late father as the head of swatch group we should also mention magdalena martulloblocher who took the reins at chemicals company emschemie when her father became a federal councillor and jasmin staiblin who helms the abb group in switzerland either way this new political formula could be of very short duration the federal election of will redistribute positions and determine the future composition of the federal council the seat of justice minister eveline widmerschlumpf now abandoned by her party is shaky and the socialist micheline calmyrey who will take up the rotating post of president again next year will soon retire and it is suggested that it will be a man who will succeed her switzerland could therefore revert back to having only two women in the federal council in and will thus drop down the rankings of countries with governments containing a strong female presence this article was translated from french by jessica reed,2010-09,switzerland governed majority woman

much like one of their fictional heroes buffy feminists spend a lot of time slaying not vampires but cliches no we dont hate men nor are we a monolith we come from all backgrounds and have different opinions on key feminist issues such as sex work class politics and postcolonial development and the vast majority of us do enjoy having sex finally contrary to what rose prince would have you believe in her latest daily mail instalment we also enjoy cooking princes onslaught on feminism is certainly muddled but makes for an amusing read she states that because home cooking was turned into a symbol of drudgery by secondwave feminists it is they who are allegedly responsible for the epidemic of childhood obesity booga booga a decrease in participation in sport among our youth the spread of fastfood chains and a health crisis thats costing us billions nothing about capitalism fair wages or the price of food give me a break flip flopping joys blogger says it better than i can if you must be a condescending pseudo doctor please lets be more appropriate about diagnosing try that fat person died because there were no grocery stores or running public transportation in her neighborhood or that fat person died because she worked three jobs and never had time to prepare her own meals or that fat person died because she went to a school that got its funding from soda corporations and was blasted with advertising from the time she was in middle school until the time she graduated but beyond princes misguided social analysis shes wrong when she pictures feminists as takeaway lovers who wouldnt chop a kohlrabi to save their lives the best cooks i know are feminists from all generations my grandmother mother boyfriend and friends are all part of the club they taught their sons and daughters to cook because they cared and because it is an essential part of growing up to be an independent selfsufficient adult they never stopped kneading bread baking pies or concocting batches of soup just like they never stopped having children because the pill was suddenly made available to them maybe prince should visit bloodroot one of the first feminist restaurants to open in the us which has been thriving for years or perhaps i should just extend an invitation to my house if she dares where i would regale her with homemade tarte tatin confit de canard and food tales from my childhood after all my mother brought me up well enough to be able to hold a job and cook from scratch the skys the limit in feminist parenting prince should not pretend that men cant have a say in what they eat as adults they do not have to rely on someone else to put food on their plates or make judicious food choices for them unless their domestic arrangement is so arranged most men these days greatly enjoy cooking and they are a little indebted to feminism for that dont take my word for it yesterday i asked on twitter whether my male followers liked to cook and who taught them to a flurry of positive replies came flying in some of which i handpicked below i believe princes heart is in the right place when she worries about the access and quality of the food were eating but by putting the onus on women to provide food she is only making things worse if you want families to eat well give them better access to quality produce give them more time in a very hectic schedule and bring back home economics at school for both genders take people by the hand and show them how to cook cheaply and quickly demystify the madefromscratch myth a decent simple meal shouldnt take more than minutes to create teach the benefits of stockpiling bread making gardening keep on pressuring fastfood outlets and supermarkets to deliver better produce free of additives and colourants while openly questioning the relative affordability of such items improve access to nutritious foods in poorer neighbourhoods and most importantly dont play the blame game shaming people into obedience rarely works inspire others to see food as something to celebrate something to be proud of something to savour prince mourns the decline of the gentle art of feminine food for me what matters is the art of caring for the people you love and showing it through food the questions about food cooking and nutrition that now need to be resolved do not concern gender but revolve around social and political

as three female former goldman sachs employees launch a sexual discrimination lawsuit against the firm in new york commentators have put the alleged behaviour of the firms male workers from ordering prostitutes to holding boysonly meetings on the golf course down to the testosteronefuelled banking culture the link between testosterone and the charging of escort services to corporate hospitality accounts remains unproven by modern science as does the association between the male sex hormone and the exclusion of female employees from the golf courses of middle america indeed a study suggested that oestrogen may have as much to do with aggressive behaviours in male mice as testosterone does the argument for testosterone as a cause of male chauvinism is cowardly after all you cant take a hormone to an employment tribunal blaming a testosteronedriven culture for sexism stops men taking responsibility for their behaviour this is as sexist as any piece of cod biological determinism suggesting males somehow cant help behaving like idiots after all sheer liquid chauvinism is flowing in their veins in fact testosterone has been shown to be most effective as an excuse for social aggression rather than a cause of it in another recent study participants performed more aggressively in a financial simulation game if they believed they had been given a shot of testosterone even when they had been given a placebo whereas those who had received testosterone unwittingly were in fact more likely to play fair its possible that people who are inclined towards selfish aggressive or dominant behaviour would find it easier to rationalise their actions if they felt that they were under the spell of testosterone says science writer ed yong noting that the study suggests that testosterones negative stereotype can give people a licence to misbehave feminists often rightly take offence when men dismiss women as crazy or overemotional because of the neurotypical effects of premenstrual syndrome women do not wish to be reduced to our hormones so why should we do the same to men blaming steroid aggression for corporate sexism is a copout,2010-09,three female former

dr cordelia fines new book delusions of gender how our minds society and neurosexism create difference argues against the idea that male and female brains are programmed by nature to provide contrasting talents and skills fines conclusions provide a timely warning against taking too seriously the deluge of books and articles that would have us believe that men are biologically advantaged when it comes to mathematics racing driving or map reading and that women are naturally more intuitive and nurturing so better at childcare and multitasking they can look after a child and clean at the same time no marks for guessing that masculine skills tend to be the ones with status in our particular society gender difference is a thorny issue and historians would be unwise to enter where even some scientists fear to tread but leaving the merits of scientific evidence aside history shows that whenever women start to demand equal access to what have traditionally been mens roles theories about their natural unsuitability tend to emerge recently this has ranged from women not being tough enough to present radio s today programme according to ceri thomas the programmes editor in march to reservations about women lacking the necessary competitiveness for the red in tooth and claw worlds of the boardroom or topflight politics at a time when women are still challenging the glass ceiling while facing an equality backlash the popularity of science indicating biological brain differences between the sexes and from that concluding that women simply cant cut it comes as little surprise despite its claim to objectivity science cannot be immune to the anxieties of its day influenced as it must be by the society within which it is produced our fascination with gender difference as resulting from nature rather than nurture was just as strong at the end of the th century that was when the firstwave womens movement began to raise its voice demanding access to higher education the professions and the vote womens pleas were met with disdain by many scientific and medical men who provided evidence to prove that giving in to womens demands was not only a bad idea but a harmful one too influenced by darwin cuttingedge science pointed to a womans smaller lessdeveloped brain and asked if she could be safely trusted with the vote womens subjectivity to her emotions ordained by her evolution was yet another question mark over her judgement and as to higher education a womans inability to cope with the intense brain work which came naturally to men was simply a matter of fact eminent doctors such as sir henry maudsley warned that women would have nervous breakdowns if pushed too far and were placing themselves in danger of becoming masculinised and infertile there were calls for protective legislation to be introduced for women of the middle classes attending college analogous to acts that protected women and children working in the mines as women made some gains so a small chorus of dissent grew louder in their book the evolution of sex biologist patrick geddes and j arthur thompson lobbied against higher education and a broader social role for women as what was decided amongst prehistoric protozoa cannot be annulled by an act of parliament the social scientist herbert spencer one of the most influential thinkers of his day argued that female evolution had stopped at a stage before mans to preserve vital organs for reproduction if a woman expended energy on intellectual pursuits energy would be diverted from her reproductive system and she would become sterile because of this any extensive change in the education of women with a view to fitting them for business and professions would be mischievous this type of thinking was not new but the scientific language that cloaked it was ideas about sexual difference specifically womens inferiority to the male benchmark go back as far as aristotle and plato with the issue waxing and waning since then in the th century as now the debate raged there were fears about women abandoning domesticity to take on mens roles and talk of a crisis in masculinity as men no longer knew what they were for sound familiar science has proved itself a useful tool in the struggle against change and social issues can easily transmute into unassailable scientific fact rather than opinion theories that universityeducated women may acquire moustaches and the inability to have babies may be discredited now but i wonder how todays science will look in years time,2010-09,dr cordelia fine

writing about sex has often been problematic for women writers in india our literary world is currently stirredup over the remarks of vibhuti narain rai the vicechancellor of a prestigious university in a recent interview rai stated that over the past few years hindi women writers have vied to prove that each is a bigger chinaal than the other chinaal is an urdu word that may be translated to mean adulterous woman or whore referring to a wellknown woman writers autobiography rai said the work should have been titled kitne bistaron mein kitni baar how many times in how many beds in casual conversation such comments might have been ignored but they were part of an interview in naya gyanoday a literary monthly published by bharatiya jnanpith an organisation that awards some of indias most important literary prizes women writers in india have not had it easy freedom of expression has come in dribbles after long struggles in many quarters it still requires a great deal of gumption to write about the body sex and sexuality more than writers have demanded the expulsion of both rai and the editor of naya gyanoday about have boycotted bharatiya jnanpith and its awards both rai and bharatiya jnanpiths director have been sent a criminal notice by a district court for intentionally defaming women writers what this will lead to is uncertain but the incident throws up vital questions about womens freedom education and power hindi poet and translator giriraj kadoo said the vicechancellor of a central university makes a cheap and abusive remark about women writers as part of an articulated dialogue on feminism and women writing and is allowed to go scot free the controversial piece appeared in the magazine of indias paramount literary institution bharatiya jnanpith which gives the countrys most prestigious literary award it is shocking to see that jnanpith has gone this far to save a tainted employee it is a sure sign of the sad decline of a great institution the world of hindi literature has godfathers and women writers are reluctant to antagonise them influential critics are comfortable with women writers only as long as they play safe and avoid controversial topics as soon as sex comes into the picture sweat builds on brows obscenity charges abound and writers are effectively silenced through coercion or threat there is pressure to write about it in a certain marketable way which is again a mockery of both literary freedom and truth tehelka columnist gaurav jai questions whether the issue deserves such rage isnt it time indian women upturned the status quo by refusing to look at a word like slut with such outrage but specific words are less significant than the attitudes they reflect rais tone is misogynistic regressive and censoring his contention that women must not write about the body so much is patronising and prescriptive this can hardly be ignored considering his office the issue is reflective of a larger problem in the literary world one that goes to the heart of what it means to be a woman writer what little freedom one is allowed and the silences which must be observed it is cause for serious thought and in this case hopefully some action,2010-09,writing sex ha often problematic woman writer india literary world currently stirredup remark vibhuti narain rai vicechancellor prestigious university recent

you get an interesting perspective on changing social attitudes towards sex from the bottom of an ft fivemetre firemans pole used by lap dancers as part of a complicated choreographed display oscar owide proprietor of the windmill club in soho is distracted by how to achieve the best lighting on the girl in black knickers who is descending head first from the top of pole gripping on with her thighs dancing upside down with her arms its ever so difficult to do that he says and asks a waiter to get the spotlight changed so her performance is less hidden by shadows when a flattering pink ray has been switched on to the dancer owide who has been running soho clubs for decades reflects on how much more open society has become to this form of entertainment his clients no longer need to hide the fact that they visit nude dance clubs he says most of the stigma has disappeared and a night out at a lapdancing club now qualifies as respectable corporate entertainment with receipts provided so expenses can be recouped from the company there is no prostitution here but clients can stay until in the morning watching individual erotic dances from workers at a go by midnight a cashier is busy processing debit card payments from men who want a solo dance from one of the or so women who are waiting in their knickers and bras by the bar a wellspoken man wonders aloud if he can leave his bar council membership card as security to the right a young man sits in a booth by himself his suit jacket off and top buttons undone his legs splayed wide apart so there is space for a woman in a black thong and suspenders to touch her toes and wobble her naked buttocks no more than centimetres from his face an observer of the mutating sex industry in soho for most of his life owide has an unexpectedly censorious view on the sex scandal of the week wayne rooneys alleged liaison with a sex worker he isnt shocked in the least by the fact that rooney slept with a prostitute but he disapproves deeply of rooneys decision to be unfaithful to his wife when she was pregnant clearly owides views are shaped by his long involvement in what he describes as the business but his position chimes with the broader response to rooneys behaviour there has been indignation at his betrayal of his wife a lot of outrage that an expensively educated girl like jennifer thompson would decide to become a prostitute and considerable bafflement that an england footballer cant get as much sex as he wants for free there has been much less moralising about the central transaction rooneys readiness to employ a prostitute so far rooneys sponsors are apparently ready to overlook the event dismissing it yesterday as a private matter indicating that in the hierarchy of corporate morality use of a prostitute is viewed as a much lesser evil than taking drugs when kate moss was filmed taking a line of coke it had an immediate impact on her advertising contracts does this indifference suggest that prostitution no longer disturbs anyone very much has the explosion in the easy availability of internet porn mens magazines stag nights lapdancing clubs and sex tourism begun to erode our perception of prostitution as an enduring taboo clubowners like owide are seeing a stark shift in attitudes but campaign groups academics prostitute collectives and men who use prostitutes notice it too research documents highlight the difficulty of grasping any accurate statistics about the prevalence of prostitution in the uk home office papers cite research which suggests that there might be about prostitutes in the uk and a more recent calculation that there could be between and million men who pay for sex stressing that the data is unreliable however a study estimated that the numbers of men buying sex had doubled in a decade an increase prompted by a greater acceptability of commercial sexual contact premier league footballers exist in a bubble behaving in a way only distantly connected to normal life exfootballers this week have described how girls routinely target players hiding in their rooms there were nights we went to the strip club and there was loads of money flying around and all the girls were going the extra mile just for the cash one player recalls even beyond the cashladen world of the premier league there is no shortage of supply during the s the number of men paying for sex acts in the uk is estimated to have doubled it has never been difficult to find an escort but men who have used prostitutes recently describe how technology has made things dramatically easier in just the same way that the internet has simplified the way we buy flights and books finding someone to pay for sex has become a headachefree process online before youd have to look for coded messages in the lonely hearts columns or in the newsagents window women who wanted to meet generous gents was a signal that they were looking to be paid on the internet its much easier to find where to go and theres no pretence you have greater choice peter a volunteer charity worker who like most men interviewed for this piece did not want his full name printed says the new availability of free internet porn can also have the effect of stoking an appetite he adds the analogy might be i suppose that its like watching match of the day and then being inspired to go out and play football and try out something youve seen websites where men can post reviews of named and often pictured prostitutes are easily accessed through google speaking openly about using prostitutes remains unusual but the anonymity of the web means users can be as frank as they like in their discussions a typical exchange on a site yesterday runs natasha can be particularly recommended for her figure and her oral technique natasha isnt particularly busty only a c cup true true but im willing to overlook a shortcoming if the remainder is exceptional the lapdancing industry is at pains to make a distinction between what they provide and the illegal sale of sex in massage parlours but for men who go to their clubs the line is often more blurred for a generation of men in their s and early s strip clubs have become an unremarkable fairly uncontroversial nightclub option forcing them to reassess their own attitudes towards the exchange of money for titillation harry an advertising executive visited a brothel twice on a recent holiday in greece most guys have gone to a strip club and have probably had their fair share of dating and casual sex or whatever he says theres not a great divide between strip clubs and brothels and i think thats why people like us would consider it because it doesnt feel like a massive departure his attitude was also shaped by his frequent use of online dating organisations ive been using internet dating sites quite a lot recently and the mindset is very similar you meet up with people with no real anticipation of anything happening and you end up having casual sex because its easy so theres a sort of laziness to it it doesnt really mean anything its ready and accessible and thats exactly how it felt in this place in greece he says dan an online marketing executive visited strip clubs while he was abroad and came away unsettled by the experience i was on holiday it was fun it wasnt that big a deal i didnt feel i was part of that exploitation he says it wasnt sexy it was just so transactional everything that that kind of intimacy shouldnt be and obviously you know what it is its just business business business but it was almost like a vending machine peter stringfellow owner of stringfellows another central london table dancing club also makes it clear that there is nothing to connect prostitution and the light entertainment his club provides but agrees that taboos around his industry are disappearing the people who visit his clubs are now affluent and successful doctors lawyers people travelling on business city workers professor stephen hawking has been to the club and ive had a few drinks with him my view is that if professor stephen hawking has been then the door is wide open for anyone in the world he says womens groups are split on how to respond to the growing indifference towards the idea of women selling their bodies for sex and pornography niki adams of the english collective of prostitutes says she welcomes what she sees as a widening acceptance of women working in prostitution because she believes it will reduce the stigma discrimination that many sex workers face and because it means that the public are now viewing this as a reasonable employment choice but other feminist organisations warn that an emerging readiness to portray women who sell their bodies as making empowered choices is very misleading while antipornography campaigners are uneasy about the longterm consequences of this increasing acceptance of pornography and lap dancing it has never been easier or more acceptable to buy or sell womens bodies for sex acts says kat banyard author of the equality illusion a portrait of modern feminism the scale of prostitution pornography and lapdancing industries is unprecedented much of this is driven by the development of technology now porn can be acquired cheaply immediately and anonymously in your bedroom meanwhile the porn industry has cleverly marketed itself though mens magazines as a world where women are sexually liberated and empowered the reality is very different the effect of being in that industry is devastating with of women suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder television programmes like billie pipers belle de jour are prone to romanticise the profession emphasising the glamour most of britains prostitutes are drug users girls who grew up in care women who are very vulnerable and who are passing a large amount of the money they receive on to the men who run them campaigners stress women who have more in common with the profile of the five sex workers who were murdered in ipswich in matt mccormack evans an activist who will launch the anti porn men project on monday is concerned that the growing consumption of online porn among adolescents is fostering a new more open attitude towards paying for sex mccormack evans is and dismayed by the speed with which his generation has been presented with enormous unprecedented access to cheap porn a decade ago pornography might be something borrowed from cousins hidden under your mattress it was difficult to get hold of there was a feeling that it was something that needed to be kept secret it is not like that now there is a sense that you dont need to pretend that you dont consume this he says there is a school of thought that argues that pornography use has no greater correlation with paying for sex than the link between smoking cannabis progressing to injecting heroin but mccormack evans worries that the growing scale of porn consumption could have unexpected effects pornography encourages certain attitudes towards sex a vision of women as objects that are acted upon there is reason to fear that this will translate into more men seeking sex from prostitutes and that there will be a desire to match the aesthetics of pornography in everyday life in windmills owide is nostalgic for the soho he knew years ago when i first came here women used to walk the streets it was lovely he says the atmosphere now his club gives clients the chance to look at girls far prettier than they would ever be able to marry in front of them with their legs wide open he says its amazing a bleaker snapshot of the modern face of sohos sex industry comes from david miles a former drugs project worker now unemployed who says he has been buying sex for the past

forty years ago the miss world final featured bob hope michael aspel and two beauty queens black and white from apartheid south africa no one today would remember much about the show except that it was disrupted mocked completely rubbished by representatives of the womens liberation movement armed with whistles football rattles subprime vegetables and water pistols filled with blue ink radio has marked the occasion with a terrific reunion programme in which sue macgregor moderates a discussion between three of these feminist heroines aspel jennifer hosten as miss grenada the nights actual winner and a miss world trusty it was a question of smack on the bum get out and smile because this was live i listened with delight and a growing question why did no one try something similar on big brother eviction night why does no one try it on the x factor did they maybe except that they got stopped and censored will something real and hilarious happen tonight supposedly bbs last will we ever get to hear about it if so you can look up the miss world final on youtube its an appalling spectacle oldstyle bbc light entertainment at its worst the albert hall is done up as a glittery sound stage on which glide and slither dinnerjacketed loungelizardy males the girls come on in national costume like dollies stuck on toilet rolls then in highontheleg onepiece swimsuits worn with heels hope is old sour deeply rattled the phrase cattle market had been used on a chatshow the day began with a small explosion claimed by the angry brigade under an empty bbc outside broadcast van as macgregor put it the show was both anachronistic and degrading watching it even nowadays i feel myself flush all over with waves of earlys prefeminist girlishness misery a sense of imprisonment sexual shame forty years later the battered shell of the miss world pageant drags itself along like a zombie in the show provoked riots in abuja nigeria in which people were killed the final happens next month in sanya a beach resort in china its spirit though lives on in bb the x factor all those gruesome television spectacles in which usually goodlooking often vulnerable young people mostly though not invariably women because that would be sexist submit themselves to harsh even sadistic judgment delivered by glossedup celebrity professionals in the studio and by the baying mob at home in the olden days miss world was idiotic but blessedly superficial vital statistics were noted rear views admired token commitments made to world peace these days the sizingup goes on scrutinising looks abilities hopes delusions any aspect of a persons outer or inner being that happens to capture the fancy of the allseeing camera eye sometimes the method picks up on moments that are warm odd funny touching like lots of people i have spent loads of time over the past decade gripped by big brother fascinated by the reality or otherwise of romances tantrums breasts hanks of hair and yet the surveillance is also demeaning and depressing with an insidious invidious way of pumping yet more pressure into a viewers already overloaded head keep up the work on the look the smile the chirpiness the perfection keep up the phoney selfbelief or else on last weeks x factor for example we saw a couple of nicelooking young people with fantastic voices pleasant manners and so little weirdness or neuroticism that the cameras barely stopped to note their names more time was given to ablisa the one who lost it and started fighting and to yearold cher lloyd who cant really sing or rap or anything but who admires cheryl cole so much she has copied the tattoo she wears on her hand cher apparently is the bookies favourite and already a tabloid darling the other day the daily mail was happily fretting that shes been seen shaking and not eating much for her dinner maybe it gleefully speculates cher cant take the strain its not that the x factor is the cause or source of this hateful media sadogawping but then neither was miss world the cause or source of the grotesque objectification from which it took its shape its very crassness however made it a useful vehicle as the historian sally alexander one of the demonstrators in has said for the public announcement regarding the place of women in society that she and her comrades wanted to make now it wont be so easy for anyone trying to do something similar with a programme the tech the pr the security are so sophisticated youve got to be very careful to avoid a hint of terrorism no nerf blasters or super soakers or anything resembling guns or bombs i wont be there unfortunately when someone finally works out how to do it im too old and tired too stuck at home with childcare too out of touch with all this social media stuff from where im sitting though i keep hearing about how entertainment industry employers exploit young peoples energy and ambition in internships that never turn into proper lifesustaining jobs i hear about facebook groups and flash mobs and vuvuzelas sooner or later someone will see a physically nonviolent poetically explosive way of cracking it all open if only for a second all i can say is that if you care to try it

from reclaiming the f word to objecting to objectification theres a new feminist army determined to finally flatten the patriarchy but heres the really radical news patriarchy is dead its dead simplistic dead inaccurate and no longer a useful way of framing gender inequality in the uk forget about castrating patriarchy its time to corral kyriarchy the system identified by harvard theologian elisabeth schussler fiorenza which explains how ethnicity class economics and education as well as gender intersect to oppress us all men as well as women so kyriarchy the substitution of one elitist etymological hairsplitting term for another i hear my newly estranged sisters cry just what feminism needs but this is a neologism with a difference where patriarchy literally rule of the father explains only how traditional male authority dictates to and subjugates women kyriarchy from the greek kyrios lordmaster archion dominionrule relates how each of us whatever our gender is a bundle of privileges we can all too readily abuse by invoking the master power whether thats as a black female barrister a mixedrace trans male teacher or a white immigrant male labourer at the same time the terms connotations of elite authority perfectly tap into the legacy of oppression that western feminists from mary wollstonecraft to germaine greer have dedicatedly derided scoff at my linguistic parsing but terminology matters just as contemporary feminism is so keen to detox the term feminist so patriarchy carries a whole truckload of outdated assumptions about maleperpetuated oppression that blinker us all take porn for example patriarchy just isnt useful when we want to talk about how its proliferation is negatively impacting on men and women alike kyriarchy by contrast accounts for the increasing numbers of men who are suffering from sexual performance anxiety or emotional disconnection with women which can be related to xrated overconsumption and how female performers who can make good money out of being the object of both male and female desire and envy can argue they are somewhat empowered by doing so this isnt to claim porn stars as emancipated feminist role models its just to recognise that sexual allure and money rightly or wrongly accord power that oppresses too kyriarchy links the latest feminist wave to decades of activism while better framing todays more subtle oppressions it helps us to recognise the interconnection of education class and eating disorders such as anorexia and of domestic violence and poverty rather than encouraging us to indiscriminately blame men it contextualises the contempt of workingclass male unionists towards margaret thatcher it helps to explain how women themselves can in some cases morph into the supremacist bully when paranoid mothers pass on anxieties about food and bodies to their daughters ground down themselves by years of trying to live up to constructed notions of beauty perhaps most importantly kyriarchy exposes a sin within the womens movement itself that of feministperpetuated oppression i can already hear feminists hissing at me as i type but dont worry ill hiss at myself in the mirror later for perpetuating the stereotype of internecine catfighting when feminist commentators and charities working to liberate sex workers relate their tales for them rather than letting them speak firsthand thats kyriarchy its also kyriarchy when minority male feminists are forced to veto voting rights in equality action groups because they are male kyriarchy has the potential to settle the ageold argument about privileged feminism once and for all perhaps thats why its so frightening to those that balk at the term and will dismiss this as yet another example of womaneatingwoman it may feel counterintuitive but recognising your own privilege doesnt make the struggle for gender equality any less credible it makes it more so by allowing feminists to see that advantages such as being born to a semiprosperous family or being welleducated dont necessarily protect against say rape whatever british feminism has achieved it has never managed to fully convince men to get their march on at least kyriarchy with its emphasis on individual liberation and social equality gives guys a chance to whinge about how theyre oppressed too and not just by the feminists,2010-09,reclaiming word

somewhere right now a man has just exited the shower and is standing naked in front of a mirror examining his reflection hes casually flexing his biceps and tracing the subtle rivets between his crisp abdominal muscles with his thick fingers he may even be gently cradling the undercarriage of his groin much like a mother would a child but does this man actually exist no because i just dreamed him up out of thin air no doubt projecting my own insecurities upon his sculpted statuesque physique i could have just as easily described a man who is sitting on the couch watching telly unwashed and eating a bag of crisps for breakfast when parsing the complexities of contemporary masculinity both versions are equally relevant but only the former can be used to successfully market deodorant every decade or so a new trend be it aesthetic or otherwise emerges to challenge the status quo of what it means to be a man from the mids up until now the neologism of the moment was metrosexual which was often used to describe men who take pleasure in spending their disposable income on fancy hair gels but now spurred on by the popularity of mad men and made timely by the onset of the hesession the metrosexual is being pushed aside in favour of the menaissance a brave new era of manhood in which men are putting their feet down and reclaiming their manliness from whoever it was that thieved it from them so far the trend has been limited to adverts and sales gimmicks but is expected to leak out into the public sometime round halloween what were once the radical feminist ideals of the s have now become commonplace both in the us and the uk females have long outperformed males in school and are now beginning to dominate the workplace as well and last week it was reported that young single childless women are earning higher salaries than their male counterparts in the majority of us cities many men have welcomed such news others barely noticed some were indifferent while a troubled few have desperately clung to the whole pie in the face of this gender turbulence and economic uncertainty the narrative of men reclaiming their manhood makes perfect marketing sense whether packaged in an aerosol can or in the form of an affordable line of menswear ones fleeting sense of manness is just a banana republic away but this creeping manpanic isnt limited to advertising campaigns and middle management redundancies earlier this year the lower depths of academia also got into the mannish market when an american college opened up a male studies department to counteract what members of the discipline perceived as a feminisms denigration of maleness these phenomena and the associated chicanery help to explain the hysterical levels of anticipation that surrounded don drapers return to the bbc this week and series four started off with a rather difficult question who is don draper perhaps a more pertinent question would have been what as in what is it that makes don draper so irresistible to both men and women and why in her book mad men unbuttoned natasha vargascooper theorises about the root of drapers appeal beyond his movie star good looks though he rarely flaunts it there is a sense of safety about don its clear that he has a sturdy protective embrace don n dick is such an endearing character because he represents the quagmire of st century manhood he is at once paternal and predatory a man in transition who is falling apart piece by piece as he drunkenly stumbles towards the future he is the masculinity crisis personified and conveniently enough hes also the

until she was kat banyard assumed that struggles for womens rights were the stuff of history books of blurry photos of suffragettes slightly less blurry photos of s protesters she had grown up in a close loving family attended an all girls comprehensive and when it came to sexual equality all had seemed right with the world then she went to university to study psychology there she started noticing odd little incidents sexist comments male students using porn a lecturer illustrating a talk about memory function with pictures of the tennis player anna kournikova in a bikini i remember feeling very uncomfortable about those pictures being used by someone who had authority over me says banyard i started wondering what does he think of me what does he think of other women she wasnt sure why these incidents bothered her so much but when her mother lent her the descent of woman an anthropological study by british author elaine morgan published in this first brush with feminist writing changed her life i remember exactly where i was when i was reading it she says and it was like someone had taken the shades off everything looked different banyard was propelled into action into an extra ordinary feminist mission that has included organising major conferences changing the law denouncing the sex industry and defending the rights of refugee women a generation of girls like me had grown up thinking that discomfort about sexism was their problem but in that moment i realised it wasnt just a personal bugbear it was because these issues are all linked part of something much bigger part of structural inequality i remember feeling really frustrated why werent feminist issues headline news less than a decade later banyard has become the most influential young feminist in the country i suspect she will hate this title when i ask personal questions she wrinkles her nose when i ask whether she sees herself as a leader in the womens movement she quickly says no before adding that movements are led by ideas by ideals true of course but not the whole story in some ways she is a slightly unlikely feminist figurehead she is modest mild mannered quiet with just a subtle edge of intensity when she speaks i ask where her incredible drive comes from the motivation that has led her to pursue fulltime feminist activism without pay while many of her peers are often understandably forging careers based on the size of their salaries is she driven by anger no again i think i just like seeing the best in humanity if you believe in the inherent dignity of people in justice and human rights then feminism is for you it says that rape isnt natural for men that men arent inherently violent and that women arent just naturally insecure about their bodies and other issues the best of us is to be found in feminism i find that hugely inspiring its no surprise on some level when banyard halfjokingly says that lisa simpson is her feminist heroine she does seem to share a prodigious thoughtful morality with that small yellow cartoon character in march faber published banyards book the equality illusion and she decided to sink the money from her deal into activism in the book she lays out the issues facing women including domestic and sexual violence the pay gap and abortion rights and sketches out ways to tackle them it is a great introduction for anyone who hasnt followed the womens movement closely and while it is faintly familiar territory to those who have it is still an enormous achievement packed with eyepopping and fundamentally depressing statistics women own just of the worlds land and property murder is the leading cause of death for pregnant women in the us each year an estimated million women worldwide are left permanently disabled or infertile and die as a result of unsafe abortion there are many other details to make you weep i knew that it is estimated that tens of thousands of women are raped in the uk each year and i knew that the rape conviction rate stands at i did not know as banyard points out that a diversity or vulnerability issue is identified in more than of reported rape cases mental health or learning disabilities being the most frequent not surprisingly the horrendously low rape conviction rate is even lower in these cases banyard didnt rest after publication this spring she launched ukfeminista an organisation that acts as a hub for womens groups its website gives people a space to network share information about specific campaigns and find out how best to agitate for change it comes at a time when the uk womens movement is bursting with energy as banyard points out just five years ago there seemed to be just a handful of fledgling grassroots womens groups she is now aware of of which have started in the last six months while she is quick to say that these groups have not sprung up as a result of ukfeminista there is no doubt that the organisation is proving a strong spur banyards interests are broadbased she isnt content with working on a single issue but aims to tear down the entire spiders web of sexual inequality when i ask what most fires her what she would concentrate on if she could attack only one issue she slowly ardently argues true to form for two the first is the sex industry she says that in terms of the basic arguments people generally accept that rape is bad and that we need more women in power but ask people about the sex industry and the arguments are still ongoing there are continued suggestions that prostitution is just another potentially enjoyable career choice that pornography has no ill effects whatsoever theres so much misinformation about the reality of the sex industry she says what it does to the women involved what it does to consumers and what it does to all women in society the scale of it only really hit her when she was writing her book it was then that she spoke to women in prostitution such as emma who saw eight or nine clients a day so many that she was in serious pain i gave longer blowjobs where possible emma told banyard to shorten the time they had intercourse with me banyard also quotes the work of kelly holsopple who has surveyed women who work in lapdancing clubs and found that of them have experienced physical abuse at work including being bitten slapped pinched or punched all of the women had also been sexually abused in the clubs ranging from having their breasts grabbed to men attempting and succeeding to penetrate them vaginally with fingers and bottles banyard points out in her book that the porn industry is now estimated to be worth bn bn a year more than the combined revenue of microsoft google amazon yahoo ebay apple netflix and earthlink her concern is that this industry is proliferating unchecked we have absolutely no idea how a world with so much pornography and prostitution might play out were currently experiencing a level of sexual exploitation which is industrialised she says the scale of which is unparalleled in human history we dont know exactly what the effects are going to be we just know that they will be big and we need to deal with it urgently the other issue that banyard is most passionate about she says is men she bursts out laughing then elaborates she says that the future of feminism depends on mens engagement it needs them and it also helps them right now manhood is highly political it means being in control often being aggressive and essentially being dominant over women until we change that we wont end rape we wont end all sorts of violence and mistreatment and that level of change cant just be imposed from the outside men have to be involved in the process of change banyard has already presided over some significant changes herself last year while working as campaigns officer at equality organisation the fawcett society she and activists from the group object successfully lobbied for a change in the law on lapdancing clubs these had simply been licensed in the same way as cafes but local authorities can now choose to license them as sex establishments during that campaign banyard and one of her colleagues gatecrashed a meeting of the lap dancing association in the boardroom sat owners and managers of various uk lapdancing clubs all male except one it is incidents such as these that emphasise banyards essential guts behind her cool calm exterior i suspect there is a character willing to take some profound risks for what she believes in there have been criticisms of the current feminist movement suggestions that leaders such as banyard arent coming up with fundamentally new ideas fundamentally new ways to tackle endemic problems the fact is though that the feminist issues that need to be addressed now are very similar to those that needed addressing in the s and indeed the s and much as we might want quick fixes they dont really exist the answer is as always hard work serious commitment and painstaking campaigning on all those counts banyard doesnt look likely to let us down,2010-09,wa kat banyard assumed struggle womens right stuff history book blurry photo suffragette

after surveying boys aged four to professor sharon lamb of the university of massachusetts criticised the narrow depictions of masculinity in recent movie adaptations of iron man and batman these films argued the psychologist offer narcissistic sexist and socially unjust male leads in contrast with the more nuanced portrayal of masculinity in the comic book superheroes of old a problem as we are told comics act as gateways to literacy for boys the study divides superheroes into socially harmful and socially positive categories but it misses the fact that no superhero can be separated from the web of relations internal to their individual stories and how each superhero relates to others in the context of the universes they belong to this report seems to echo sentiments similar to the accusations of those levelled at the genre by freidric wertham in his report seduction of the innocent originally inspired by a liberal illatease assessment of the promotion of illiteracy and moral decay by horror comics the report led to a not often retold episode in the history of american censorship in which public burnings of books happened as part of a fervent and reactionary campaign i am not suggesting the authors of the report would ever consider similar actions but i cant shake the feeling that even in this research the superhero is still chronically misunderstood by reducing all understanding of the genre to whether it is a form of toxic intrusion into childhood we miss the complexity of their interactions and relationships yes iron man in his film version at least and batman articulate a glorious spectacle of dripping wealth and greyarea morality but the narratives of their respective worlds already include layers of selfdeception personal uncertainty and the difficulty of every quest for higher ideals witness for example iron mans lashing out at his own reflection after watching a news report about terrorists using his technology to hold a village to ransom or batmans never ending mission for personal absolution through an obsessive struggle with criminals which he pursues instead of dealing with his own guilt at the death of his parents each character through their labours and failures embodies a set of vices and virtues that we can reflect upon in order to navigate our own way through the complexity of ethical and moral situations we may find ourselves in some of the most complex stories which feature superheroes from superman to spiderman ironman and batman all involve a recognition of the ultimate impossibility to always prevent harm in the spiderman comic and movies the death of peter parkers uncle ben results in his awareness of his responsibility towards others batman is punished in the dark knight for ignoring the obscure threat posed by the joker in order for him to pursue his vendetta against organised crime this ultimately results in the death of the woman he loves iron man is shown in the first of his films to discover his companys implication in war profiteering and proceeds to close his weapons development programmes in all of these narratives the hero of the film must come to terms not only with his own implication in the harm done to others but must accept that his ability to make finite choices sometimes results in the exclusion of generally good outcomes this does not undermine the heroism of the superhero but places it in a context of precariousness and uncertainty where doing a good deed must be seen as taking place in a world where the consequences are unpredictable despite this uncertainty the heroes must shoulder the great responsibility their power brings them without any of the security of reliable moral virtues it should also be noted as scifi writer joss whedon has agreed that movies are gateway drugs into the graphic novels and comics themselves where more layers of emotional complexity become available for children to engage with and think through so perhaps the young men who see the films will discover fictional universes populated with characters such as the xmen and green arrow these are heroes who see that adversity hardship and community are not distinct from

women dare you approach the pyramid of egregiousness this is the new chart thats been put together by womens groups in the us to classify the hate words used against us from bad to worse to really quite stinkingly repulsive use your finger of defiance to log on and see it at nameitchangeitorg there a reeking sewage system of sexist sideswipes has been organised into a colourful triangle its the latest project in contemporary feminisms use of the internet to network campaign critique and challenge and it is spearheaded among others by renowned us feminist gloria steinem looking at the pyramid i am impressed by mens creativity tenacity complexity sincerity and commitment for the very first time its a bit like the top smash hits countdown a few old faves peppered among the contemporary classics novelty jingles and onehit wonders at the pinnacle are terms classed as severe misogyny outright objectifying and dehumanising hate words such as bitch whore slut cunt feminazi and new entries such as cougar and milf btw milf means mom id like to fuck and fyi the first time i heard it was in new york at an otherwise allmale meeting of advertising guys at a major womens magazine corporation oh how those men laughed among themselves as i worked out the acronym i couldnt protest because id lose my job and be labelled yep a feminazi next down on the pyramid are words classed as really damn sexist this is for all those backstabbing phrases euphemisms and digs think ice queen nag shrill difficult cold at the base of the pyramid is just plain sexist this is your daily standard breadandbutter misogyny it includes commenting on a womans appearance calling her a girl a babe a sweetie or lightly saying shes bossy or flighty the point of the pyramid so to speak is not to have every word filed in its rightful place we are not s librarians all the terms are terms of hatred originally invented sometimes centuries ago by men now used by both sexes the pyramid is a symbol a resource a focal point a concentration of their hate and our anger you can add to it and on the same site you can also testify about examples of media sexism id like to add some words to the pyramid myself theres humourless paranoid selfish prudish unable to take a joke hysterical manhating aggressive butch these words essentially just mean shut up woman theyre for any woman who dares to get angry and instead of letting the insults sink deep asks the perpetrator just what the hell they think theyre doing manhater in particular makes me laugh women waste a lot of time submissively explaining to misogynists like good schoolgirls why they dont hate men how feminism benefits both sexes and how misogyny must be recognised by all of society ill say this i do indeed hate any man who hates women and expresses his hate in his language his manner his behaviour and his art then there are the socalled ironic seasidepostcard terms for women and our body parts how about funbags i think the pyramid should proudly bear a rack of funbags or how about some casual infantilisation in his last series jamie oliver made a meal for some inmates at a womens prison in venice he delivered it to them with a leer and the phrase here you go girlies like a square of shitsoaked toilet paper the pyramid is a repository for so much nasty matter but much misogynist language is far subtler than oneword disses there is the question of tone which renders any word even one as seemingly innocuous as she totally malign the cleverest most belittling insult i ever heard against a woman was a posh man at the tate modern talking about rachel whitereads turbine hall installation yeah he said shes fun delivered with an infuriating mocking grin then there was the radio network head i heard talking to a male producer about a globally famous pop star who came in and was professional articulate and intelligent shes a funny one isnt she yep replied his flunky if you open her up youll just find batteries and wires even seemingly nice words are often used against us delivered with sizzling spite and patent enjoyment of the victims discomfort the hisses of thats good keep doing that and thats nice whenever i go jogging the homeless guy who said to a friend got a light no well youre looking quite smoking to me babe one afternoon at a road crossing in covent garden a man turned around and began harassing the woman next to me hello how are you darling you are so pretty you look like a supermodel where are you going she didnt reply he didnt stop all these arseholes would say they were only complimenting their victims what are we going to do with our pyramid when its all filled up once weve exhausted ourselves typing our testimonies are we supposed to tote it like a school art project from pavilion to pavilion hoping to shame people into stopping that wont work misogynists dont have any shame they really enjoy attacking women they are not afraid of us they enjoy the sight of our anger and frustration one of my qualms about online activism particularly sites where we out harassers and other types of sex attacker or anonymously post reports of the daily casual misogyny we all endure is that while we feel better afterwards we have not changed anything in the outer world we have just invented a coping mechanism a way to squeeze out and siphon off our rage we have set up an online sympathy group a survivors forum a venting arena but we have not fought the perpetrators much as i like and applaud it i want to see the threedimensional foldout version of the pyramid of egregiousness i want a d glowinthedark dodecahedron a planetsized matrix of misogyny a trillionfaceted dynamo of jet black turbo hate then id heave it aloft and hurl it into the sun where it would set off a massive chain reaction and shoot out skyscraping beams of feminist rage which kill anyone male or female whos ever used those words wiping out id say of human society but leaving the nonwomanhaters behind then we could all relax and be happy which sexist terms and phrases do you find most annoying,2010-09,woman dare approach pyramid egregiousness new chart thats put together

the publication of a calendar showing a number of newlyelected czech women mps in cometobed poses has caused something of a media furore in recent weeks as the wall street journal enthused a new generation of czech women is coming of age that is embracing femininity and sex appeal while at the same time fighting for and winning more equal treatment in the realms of business and government according to a deputy speaker of the lower house of the czech parliament katerina klasnova aka miss january the aim of the calendar is to highlight the presence of women in czech politics to those who might be sceptical lenka andrysova miss september has replied that there are different kinds of feminism so what are we to make of this form of political advertisement i would say that what it signals is less voice for people in czech politics rather than more in the may election women were voted into the lower house bringing the proportion of women up from to this is the same as in the uk but still significantly less than under state socialism and only about half the current level in cuba or sweden the calendar was produced by the public affairs vv veci verejne party a new formation on the czech political scene the party won seats and together with the ods and top parties is now a member of the ruling coalition these events are part of a context of the deep unpopularity of politicians in the czech republic moreover as social inequalities have increased so politicians have not been averse to taking financial advantage of their position on a scale that can make the expenses scandal in britain pale into insignificance all this has given rise to a condition among czech voters that a recent economist article has aptly termed languid despair the public affairs party capitalised on the situation by putting together a line up of candidates away from the traditional mould the leader journalist radek john was already a household name and by pledging to wipe out political corruption in the battle for media attention during the campaign some female party candidates posed in swimsuits the girly calendar was also conceived at this time in a recycling of cold war myths it was said that the womens readiness to engage in the project was the result of years of having to wear unisex clothing under communism to those who were there this does not ring true the calendar doesnt

the highest it is worth noting that previous government was toppled in part because it had introduced healthcare fees although not high in themselves the fees were psychologically significant and deeply unpopular the options were to attempt to limit social inequalities by increasing benefits and banning the fees or to reduce benefits retain the healthcare fees and move more towards a twotier

single parents with children as young as seven will be forced to seek work or risk a benefit cut from tomorrow as new rules come into force charities are warning that up to lone parents nine out of of whom are women are being set up to fail because of the lack of jobs available to them or childcare help to go back to work the changes designed by the previous government mean that all single parents with a youngest child aged seven to nine will be switched from income support to jobseekers allowance jsa parents with a youngest child aged were moved to the new system in and those with a youngest aged were moved over in the coalition has said that the age threshold will reduce again in a years time to five when the youngest child reaches school age the move will add to pressure on families who have been identified as among the biggest losers in last weeks spending review in the days since george osborne the chancellor unveiled the governments spending plans research has consistently identified women and families as the biggest losers the institute for fiscal studies said that families would suffer the greatest losses under the welfare reform plans while an analysis by the trades union congress found that single parent families would lose most from cuts to departmental budgets overall women stand to lose more than twice as much as men research by the house of commons library found that of the bn being raised by cutting welfare alone bn twothirds is coming from women while bn is being raised from men fiona weir chief executive of gingerbread a charity that supports lone parent families said the coalition government says it wants to make work pay and to support single parents into work but the reality is that today thousands of single parents are being set up to fail government needs to act fast to improve availability of jobs with flexible working hours improve the jobsearch support provided from day one of a claim and increase access to childcare gingerbread welcomes the aim of new welfare reform proposals to make work pay but the timescale for their implementation is too long for the single parents affected by todays change we urge the government to introduce shortterm measures to help make shorthours jobs pay and to review recent decisions to cut help with childcare costs which will create a further barrier for single parents trying to get into work switching from income support to jsa does not incur immediate financial penalties but people receiving jsa are expected to be actively looking for work attending jobcentre interviews and be willing to take employment that fits within their childs school day if they refuse work they can lose up to of their payments the extension of the plans until the youngest child in a family reaches the age of five was announced at the budget when the government estimated that a further single parents would be affected in saving m between then and weir highlighted the downturn in public sector employment as a particular barrier for single parents finding jobs women make up of public sector workers and of local government employees and are expected to bear the brunt of the estimated job cuts many of them work parttime in order to fit their jobs around their family lives there just arent the jobs michael ireland a lone parent of three has been unemployed since he wound up his freelance photography business in june two weeks ago he received a letter saying his fortnightly in income support was to stop from november and that he was to get jobseekers allowance instead a change he supports in theory i think the government is right to encourage people to get jobs but the problem is they havent put in the support to help people like me get back into work he said there just arent the jobs out there at the moment and it is only going to get worse after the cuts announced last week his children two boys and and a girl attend different schools and he has to drop off and pick up the two youngest every day when i look at job adverts the first thing i look at is not the pay but the hours he said realistically i cant start until and i need to leave by at the latest ive looked at getting my daughter into a kids club at her school but its jammed full a place there costs per half hour but id take it if we could get one so that i could work he has applied for all sort of jobs

zoe browns diary was even fuller than usual one thursday last month in the morning she was booked in for a caesarean operation at lunch time she was scheduled to be back at her desk running her webdesign company an extreme work ethic perhaps but not a unique one last year frances justice minister rachida dati returned to her office five days after giving birth fearful according to reports that maternity leave could jeopardise her position her worries were wellfounded a new survey by interexec an executive agency reveals that over half of headhunters recruiting for a salary of or above believe that women should return to work immediately after childbirth if they want to be considered for top jobs most mothers prefer of course to shrink their horizons and enjoy their baby which is why the pay gap between men and women in their s and above widens so unnervingly however impending cuts in child benefit and tax credits on top of soaring living costs could impel many middleincome parents to return to work sooner than they might have chosen and although revised legislation and shifting social attitudes have made it easier to combine career and family the enormity of the shift from teletubbies to teleconferencing remains as daunting as it ever was the ideals of good mothering and work place norms are in conflict says martina klettdavies senior research fellow at the family and parenting institute its becoming more and more accepted that women can raise a family and earn a living but the dilemmas facing mothers are greater than ever because parenting has become so professionalised childhood has been given over to experts who offer conflicting advice on what kind of childcare is most effective the right time to leave your child and mothers who would once have relied on tips from their parents now feel they must have evidencebased advice luckier mothers once they have surmounted the obstacle of nannies versus nurseries will have their previous job ready and waiting for them but the woman who walks back into the office breast pads under the business suit is likely to be an altered person to the one who left it a survey conducted by online parenting network netmums found that workplace discrimination was at its worst when women returned from maternity leave with women reporting that they were treated differently managers with the best of intentions may sideline them in order to ease them back into work colleagues might resent covering for a mother who has to leave early to collect a sick child but womens own perception of themselves can also be to blame when you become a mother you can feel youve lost your way says sally russell cofounder of netmums body image is a concern and you feel youre somebodys mum rather than a person in your own right you dont have time to read the papers you dont engage in adult conversation then theres that spectre that stalks all parents guilt women who thrive are those who overcome feelings of guilt says jennifer listonsmith a maternity consultant at advice service myfamilycare many though feel guilt at work because they think they are not pulling their weight and guilt at home because they are leaving their child this can really undermine selfesteem employers need to be aware of this and offer appropriate support some larger companies have taken to employing the services of maternity coaches to advise on familyfriendly compromises and to mentor women returning from maternity leave women can also book themselves a place on a workshop run by organisations such as myfamilycare and womenlikeus but they can also help themselves with informal arrangements business psychologist ros taylor whose new book confidence at work is published in january suggests women can appoint an amenable peer as a buddy before they go on leave they can keep you in touch with whats going on at work and just as important gossip so that you dont feel cut off when you return she says for mothers who have no job to return to or who need to change their career to fit in with their new circumstances the situation is tougher danielle coolbear worked in an nhs customerservice department in london before having the first of two children three years ago she wants to return to work for social as well as economic reasons but is finding the logistical and emotional challenges a daunting obstacle i think just being back in work would relieve the sense of isolation and also be a confidence booster but its getting to that point that i have the difficulty with she says im a different person since having children in that my priorities have changed theres the difficulty of finding a flexible job weighing up the cost of childcare and transport with takehome pay and my lack of confidence at present employees with weeks or more continuous service including maternity leave have a statutory right to request flexible working hours if they have a child under or a disabled child under and their employer has a statutory duty to consider it but thats as far as it goes if the employer can demonstrate that flexible hours will undermine business the request can legally be refused part of the problem is an ingrained to mindset which has fashioned jobs to fit in with inherited routines because were so used to employing people fulltime were not used to breaking up projects into parttime chunks says listonsmith theres a culture that unless youre seen to be at your desk youre not doing your job some companies have the facilities to offer flexible working but employees especially in law and finance are reluctant to ask for it in case it counts against them and so it will until top jobs are broken down into more manageable components and flexible working is available to everyone so parents are not seen as a privileged group the extra costs of employing two people to perform one job parttime will deter some companies but it can benefit all concerned not only does the employer get two brains and perspectives for not much more than the price of one but they should expect a more refreshed and loyal workforce flexible hours can reap even more rewards without the extra outlay a mother can clock off work for school pickup then clock back on after the kids bedtime and do a teleconference with the us says listonsmith in a global market the to model really doesnt work any more small companies tend to have a better track record of this because they are more used to working round key staff in order to retain them however attitudes among larger corporations is improving partly because as the average age of firsttime mothers rises more will have reached management levels and become indispensible when they give birth five years ago firms would ask me why they should bother changing their practices says listonsmith now they want to know how they can go about it generation y is coming through with different views on worklife balance and companies are preoccupied with how to retain good staff global management consultancy accenture was this month named top uk employer for mothers by workingmumscouk because of initiatives to retain women at every level thanks to investment in the latest communications technology a third of its staff works flexibly and of flexible working requests are granted the enlightenment began a decade ago when female employees set up an informal support group and senior managers harnessed it to promote the recruitment retention and progression of women we started offering nine months maternity leave on full pay says fiona ohara human capital and diversity lead for the uk and ireland even so only came back so we added workshops for women about to go on maternity leave support during their absence and mentoring on their return and now rejoin us we had to invest in these programmes but the returns have been so great that its a nobrainer now a lot of our clients are asking how they can do the same increasing numbers of top

struggled with my confidence in a new workplace and role she says i was working full time which i found hard and after six months tried to change to a parttime role i would have happily been demoted

watching the portrayal of facebooks story on screen i saw not just a new venture an exciting innovation and a few young people making their mark on the world it was a tale of young men on a quest for dominance interwoven with lashings of disrespect for women this wasnt necessarily the surface nor the only narrative but the girls on screen were kept in place throughout the film as sidekicks groupies and nightclub dancers there only to inspire derision and passion in the geniuses doing the coding at one point in the movie when a groupie whines can we help the answer is no no one says get back in the kitchen no one says sit there and be pretty they dont have to and when it comes to sexual pleasure of course woman are giving not receiving if the women found in the social network represent the stereotype a progressive society is seeking to get beyond why are they still there why in this most modern of cyberdramas are the female characters the same as thcentury tales shamed and shaped by the pressure to comfort and be comforted by the men around them who are doing all the important exciting stuff this is not to draw any conclusions around the misogynism of facebooks founders nor those who packaged the hollywood depiction those points have been explored elsewhere instead id like to throw out a thought or two about the consequences of building social networks or indeed any information systems without a balance in gender influence if as cif user antonio recently commented the geek will inherit the earth how does that sit with female emancipation as our everyday lives become more and more connected who is writing the code building the new world in the uk only of computing professionals are women in boys sat more than of alevel computing exams this means patriarchy is rumbling on ever more prevalent in the newest freshest most powerful end of the labour spectrum the tragedy of this macho new world is it is coding patriarchy into the way we communicate when we construct systems every category is a choice every option is borne of human bias gender is thus materialised in the tools and techniques developed numerous empirical studies have shown how the absence of female input impacts the design and construction of technical artefacts for example the microwave oven the telephone robotics and software agents to ensure a future with more balance we need to reduce the deficit between men and women in tomorrows sociotechnical workforce in the next big internet startup and to achieve that it culture needs to be sexier and safer for women to enter sexier in the sense of substituting the male gaze for a human one perhaps starting to add to the technical rhetoric of speed and memory a narrative around the immense possibilities for hardware and software as applications to enhance peoples lives unfortunately we tend to portray technology as a noncreative discipline people often think of technical work as the opposite of anything creative where weaving textures sounds and colours together the sort of things little girls are encouraged to do early on does not apply but i have found that when you really take an interest in coding the opportunities for creativity are infinite there are so many new shapes options structures and ways of organising to play with but thats not the way we talk about technology and it might go some way to explaining the lack of allure technical expertise has for female students there is of course attention being given to this problem already perhaps you can comment with your experience in the field but id like to humbly suggest a few things its time to stop throwing around words like geek so little girls would rather be using machines to stroke cute little puppies than finding out how they work its time to stop mystifying code and hardware and pretending its way more complicated than it is its time for female role models up there on screen as powerful successful internet engineers and new media moguls it was nice to see trousersnake on screen but it would be have been even nicer to see a powerful female peer up there alongside him perhaps someone like christina aguilera showing women we can be filthy dirty whatever if they want to be but who can also be great coders in this way we may have a real hope of enticing girls towards a path in which they can construct algorithms and design the systems of the future,2010-10,watching portrayal facebooks story screen saw new venture exciting innovation young people making mark world wa tale young men quest dominance interwoven lashing

plinkfizz best recruitment policy and royal bank of scotland best emergency childcare sarah jackson chief executive of working families and a judge on the awards panel said being included on the list

commitment and innovation in industries which traditionally have a large male workforce she said this also carried through to a focus on fathers and paternity something that is crucial as we move towards balance and flexibility for all another judge mary mercer the principal consultant on flexible working at the ies said the overall results showed that the part played by line managers in allowing their teams to work flexibly was crucial options for flexible working are not the same thing as opportunities to work flexibly she said we know that flexible working can bring significant business benefits few organisations are currently measuring what these are or understanding what they might be in the future the award for bis may come as something of a mild embarrassment to the government after employment relations minister ed davey last month announced the government would only extend the right to request flexible working to parents of children aged under the move disappointed flexible working campaigners who hoped the right would be extended to all workers currently only parents with children aged or under have the right to ask their employer if they can work flexibly at the time cary cooper professor of health at lancaster university management school and also a judge on the working families awards said the government had succumbed to political pressure from employers who were keen to see a reduction in employment law red tape he said some employers particularly the smes dont understand what it means it is only the right to request flexible working

women are entitled to be supported for the time they need while having a child those first months with a baby are undoubtedly precious yet maternity leave differs enormously across europe last year i wrote on this very subject for cif and said that much of the uks maternity provision was poor however i am concerned that the legislation meps will vote on on wednesday which seeks to increase minimum maternity leave across europe from weeks to weeks will leave many women in britain especially lowpaid women on the minimum wage worse off financially the maths are simple for a woman on the minimum wage of working for hours a week weekly pay would be per week if she took the full entitlement for maternity leave she would receive per week for the first six weeks of full pay and per week for the next weeks standard rate regardless of earnings which amounts to she would also have the option of further weeks maternity leave unpaid this is a total of however under the proposals being voted on in the european parliament which seek to provide weeks maternity leave on full pay a woman with the same working conditions would receive per week for the first weeks a total of this would be around less than under the current system of course parttime workers would stand to lose more however there are other elements of the report that i favour such as additional provision for parents of children with disabilities as well as premature and multiple births and strengthening womens legal protection against dismissal and working time arrangements on return to work these are good aspects of the draft directive and should be supported but business groups voice concerns that i can hear even in brussels namely that businesses and in particular small and mediumsized enterprises will bear a huge financial burden if these proposals go ahead we must remember though that the very earliest they could be endorsed by each member state is not for at least another five years by which point i expect that the political and economic landscape across europe and in britain will be very different i hear the concerns but we must protect women and their right to maternity leave we have come a long way over the past years and must seek to strengthen maternity rights but in the correct way not by hitting the least well off and most vulnerable women,2010-10,woman entitled supported time need child

here we go again a young woman writes about sex and the media gets its knickers in a twist the reaction to the fuck list a joke thesis written by an american student who catalogued in graphic detail a number of her sexual encounters is somewhat hilarious in its predictability like a moral panic wringing its hands with hypocrisy quick to decry her behaviour as immoral the media continue to espouse one rule for men but a sexist doublestandard for women when it comes to sex someone please wake me up when this records changed im already bored the document in question which was supposedly for the authors friends eyes only but was leaked online after she emailed it to them is entitled an education beyond the classroom excelling in the realm of horizontal academics it appears to be an attempt at satire a thesis presented in powerpoint form that describes the sexual prowess of men who are named and identified by accompanying photographs alongside bar charts and graphs i say attempt because the most remarkable thing about it is not the shock factor of its content but how utterly dull and lacking in humour it is and while it may list erotic proclivities in detail its about as arousing as a trainspotters notepad after theyve jotted down the latest locomotive to pass through the station its badly written not captivating in any way and lacks any insight into either the authors mindset or the motivations behind the people with whom she has sex if youre going to share intimate details of your sex life with others you may as well make it arousing andor funny and this page dossier fails to do either so why besides the medias desperate onanism over women and sex is it being simultaneously hailed as a feminist tract and also an evil manifesto that will corrupt young girls fragile minds its arguable that a woman writing about her sex life and rating men based on their sexual performance just as young men in us colleges jock culture do with women may be liberating for both the author and for other young women we live in a culture where women are judged based on their looks and sexual attractiveness far more than men are refute that all you want but from the movie through to last weeks release of the social network women are still discussed purely in terms of being hot or not this thesis offers a different view demanding that women be afforded the freedom to be critical about the sex and the sexual partners they have rather than just be passive recipients or does it while this fuck list may be seen by some to be a transgression because of the role reversal of sexual objectification i would argue that it actually just reinforces sexist stereotypes for a woman supposedly liberated about sex its disappointing to note that she rates her sexual partners more highly if they compliment her on her appearance notable mentions being that she has a nice rack rather than focus on her pleasure or whether her sexual desires are being fulfilled she seems more concerned with receiving external validation of her attractiveness thus reinforcing the idea that what women really seek is to be sexually desired by men screw no pun intended actually having sexual desires of their own the demand for an appreciation of physical appearance is not onesided though throughout the document the author brags about the hotness of the men she has sex with and ranks them on their attractiveness by purely judging men on their looks shes not achieving some supposed soughtafter equality of sexual objectification just welltrodden depths of shallowness she seems to see it as an accomplishment to bed a man who is pursued by other women including those men who are in relationships already thats some proper solidarity there sister real empowerment in the making worst of all perhaps she spends time detailing the size of her sex partners penises giving them a low mark and describing their sexual prowess in negative terms if she feels they are too small theres no denying that some women are wrongly obsessed with the size of genitalia but one can hardly applaud this womans very limited portrayal of men equating their masculinity with their penis size just reinforces an oldfashioned sexism and one that potentially damages men and the development of their sexuality psychologically its disappointing that given the opportunity to challenge this narrow definition of masculinity she instead perpetuates this view and thus reinforces the notion that women are shallow phalluscentric and oblivious to the possibility that men might have insecurities about their bodies too for all the supposed humour in this thesis its still not funny or feminist for that matter to be antimen perhaps her lack of selfawareness and her inability to provide a social critique are what has led to so much criticism and the fact that she named people publicly is an obvious violation of others privacy which clearly highlights her naivety what worries me though is the widespread slutshaming the author is now receiving from the media her sex life is being routinely condemned were a man to have written this hed be getting slaps on the back or have a movie made based on his life for being a stud women who talk about sex instead attract newspaper headlines chastising them for their actions and have moral judgments cast on their behaviour which men do not have to endure while the men written about in this document will suffer a temporary embarrassment and an unjustified invasion of privacy in their lives their sexual activities and behaviour are still seen as acceptable its a sad truth that the impact of the medias attacks on this young woman will be felt for some time to come and rather than helping empower other women this joke thesis only serves to remind them that the freedom to explore their sexuality without fear of judgment is still sadly some way off yet,2010-10,go young woman writes sex medium get knickers twist reaction fuck list joke thesis written

we want more women in the workplace we want more women at senior levels we want more women on the boards of companies but we are not going to achieve this any time soon if most of the women in the current series of the apprentice have anything to do with it as a woman who works outside the home and runs a successful business i am very conscious of being in the minority i know many other successful female business owners liz earle chantal coady linda bennett anya hindmarch and many other senior women who have succeeded in organisations largely dominated by men sian westerman at rothschild amp sons helena morrissey at bank of new york mellon helen weir at lloyds banking group all these women are inspiring role models and know that they are helping to establish the value of senior women in the minds of the mainly male leaders of britains biggest companies sadly not all women are as conscious of their potential to support the cause of female advancement on wednesday the allfemale team on the apprentice having lost that weeks task had to appear in the boardroom before lord sugar and answer for their actions they were being watched by approximately million people what followed was a socalled watercooler moment discussed the next day in offices around the country a fullon descent into mayhem as all the women argued with each other about their relative culpability for their failure the team leader laura moore who i would have fired immediately couldnt have worked her way out of a wet paper bag let alone make a decision or manage a team this is the uks mostwatched business programme how are we going to advance the cause of women in the workplace if its female participants descend into a catfight when things dont go their way all that is doing is reinforcing the stereotype that exists in mens minds some call for quotas in the boardroom as happens in norway i am against it it brings quantity not quality to the boardroom more women of itself will not improve governance or corporate decisionmaking remember the company wrapit its female founder and codirector pepita diamond was banned as acting as a company director for seven years after insolvency service investigators found that she had assisted in making of false credit card refunds in the summer of enron was the seventh largest company in the us before it was brought down by accounting fraud it had a woman on the board just the one mind you wendy gramm but she was on the audit committee good examples matter i employ a lot of women and they will go far which will support the cause of their gender thats what we need not more regulation karren brady knows that and pointed it out to the women on the apprentice they could do worse than look to stella english the woman

grandparents who give up work to look after their grandchildren will no longer lose out on the basic state pension from april following a consultation on changes to national insurance credits launched by the government today the proposal if introduced would benefit around grandparents currently workingage grandparents can miss out on retirement money if they stop working before building up enough national insurance credits to get a full basic state pension the department for work and pensions said that on average people become grandparents for the first time at age and often give up work to provide childcare to a grandchild the credit aimed at anyone who is providing care for a young relative under the age of will be added to an individuals national insurance contributions record and count towards their basic state pension as of april years of ni contributions are needed to qualify for the full basic state pension minister for pensions steve webb said i have supported the idea of a grandparents credit for many years for too long the vital childcare that grandparents provide so that parents can work has been overlooked by the system it is about time that we protect the pension rights of grandparents many who are in their early s and giving up work early to provide vital childcare parents of children under and carers receive a credit towards their basic state pension so it makes sense to extend this to grandparents of working age too sam smethers chief executive of national charity grandparents plus said we warmly welcome the introduction of the grandparent national insurance credit we know that working age grandmothers on low incomes provide a substantial amount of childcare until now they have done so with the risk that they could miss out on a full basic state pension this is also an important victory for the principle that grandparental childcare does count and should be recognised we believe it has implications for other areas of government policy the government is also proposing to bring to an end ni credits for the tax year in which people reach age and the two following tax years known as starting credits to have effect from april this is expected to prevent youngsters from overseas working in the uk for a couple of years before claiming a partial pension for life years later the government said that a small number of young people currently below the age of may be hit by the removal of starting credits these are people who marry or form a civil partnership and have responsibility for children and whose spouse or civil partner dies relatively early in their working life in order to get the full amount of widowed parents allowance there is a condition that of the working life is covered by qualifying years of ni contributions or credits if starting credits are abolished this demographic may find their state pension entitlements affected the government would therefore like to hear from the bereaved to see how government should protect people whose entitlement to bereavement benefits may be affected as a result of the demise of starting credits as well as childcare providers to help define who should be included in the list of adult family members who provide familial child care the consultation begins today and runs until november,2010-10,grandparent give work look grandchild longer lose basic state

the principle that the receipt of benefits should be tied to efforts to find employment has become a cornerstone of britains welfare state two welfare reforms introduced this month will further extend and entrench this attitude on monday incapacity benefit ib claimants in aberdeen and burnley started the process of being migrated over to employment and support allowance esa in a pilot before the reform is implemented nationally in march all existing ib claimants will undergo a work capability assessment with the government estimating that some will be found ineligible for esa and transferred instead on to jobseekers allowance jsa the second reform sees the threshold at which lone parents become ineligible for income support on the basis of their parenting alone reduced from when their youngest child is to aged seven the lone parents affected by this will instead have to claim jsa which will require them to actively seek and be available for work from the childs age threshold will drop further to five so that nearly all lone parents with schoolage children will be expected to be in employment or on jsa looking for work despite crossparty consensus that work is the best form of welfare and conditionality the right tool for increasing rates of employment among benefit claimants there are numerous fault lines with both policies many people on incapacity benefit could be incorrectly found to be fit to work and there is evidence that the assessment process also fails to appropriately take account of those with mental health issues and fluctuating conditions pushing lone parents on to jsa deprives them of the freedom to choose to prioritise parenting and sends a strong message that the state does not attach much value to their caring responsibilities depicting paid work as the primary responsibility of the dutiful citizen has exclusionary outcomes for all those not able to participate in paid employment it devalues other forms of contribution such as parenting volunteering and community participation ironic in the light of david camerons big society justifications for the governments approach often stress the transformative potential of paid work to alleviate poverty and improve physical and mental health and family life but this rhetoric notably ignores the prevalence of poverty among working households and the reality of life in lowpaid menial employment it also wrongly assumes that people on benefits dont want a job most disabled people and lone parents share an aspiration to work one that is most often frustrated by an unequal discriminating and often inaccessible labour market lone parents struggle to find jobs flexible enough to combine with their parenting commitments while also having to pay for expensive childcare disabled people face a labour market that often discriminates against them and many must overcome physical attitudinal and societal barriers before finding paid employment these groups do not need sanctions but radical government action to create a more equal and accessible labour market a programme centred on delivering truly flexible working and improving opportunities for disabled people to enter the workplace would stand a far better chance of success than these illjudged reforms ruth patrick is a columnist for disability now and a postgraduate researcher in the school of sociology and

one of the difficulties of applying the concepts of justice and equality to womens lives not least for the women who live them lies in distinguishing what is inherently personal from what needs to and can only be accomplished politically one is not as simone de beauvoir put it born a woman one becomes one it is admittedly no longer the fashion to interpolate womanhood in those terms the category of woman has become one in which personal freedom has all the moral prerogative while the idea of a female politics has been more or less disowned thats well enough so long as things remain acceptable the difficulty comes when theyre not once politics have been dispensed with the discovery is made too late that there is no longer any framework for expressing anger these days the safest place for a womans anger is in the office where she has legal rights the city workers who take their millionpound harassment suits to tribunals make an interesting point of comparison with the middleclass mothers protesting at the loss of their pittance of child benefit the highpaid professionals generally win the mothers probably wont they may have cared beautifully for their children but their politics have been left to run to wrack and ruin they are at a guess not supporters of the wages for housework movement they may well be ambivalent about the tenets of feminism itself so their anger is in itself a little startling coming as it does out of the politically at least noiseless realm of modern female domestic life in fact women arent hard to radicalise the problem comes when the radicalisation isnt expressed as a set of laws if we had to ask for the vote every time there was an election we wouldnt always get it and there remain numerous aspects of equality that are left up to women to insist on in their daily lives in just this way domestic work sits right on that line as a politicised issue that lies within the remit of the personal many of the same women who assert their rights at work return to homes and families in which they do far more than their share of cooking cleaning and childcare it is in the politics of domestic life that we see the perils of an insufficiently evolved equality and as such we can identify it as the place where feminism was stopped in its tracks it remains the case that when a woman enters her home she is crossing the threshold between two worlds and entering a place where her willingness is raised to the status of a contractual obligation one woman might wish traditional forms of femininity to remain available to her in this place because she enjoys assuming different guises another might experience the same duality as acutely oppressive it is fairly likely that the former is middle class some are fulltime working mothers some are at home with the children and many spend periods in one and then the other role this is a uniquely modern drama and it is as much a psychical drama as a practical one in which home is a place governed not by concepts of fairness but by willingness and desire in domestic life the womans value is inherent unquantifiable at home she exchanges proven values for mythological ones she wants to be at home and because she is a woman shes allowed to want it this desire is her mystique it is both what enables her to domesticate herself and what disempowers her it is this notion of willingness of want to or ought to acting as a screen for have to that makes domesticity so very difficult to radicalise unlike the middleclass suffragette movement the will to radicalise domesticity has come from the margins this may be one reason why women have the vote while their domestic work remains unwaged or unrecognised the activist selma james founded wages for housework in the s as a new york factory worker turned fulltime mother she simply numbered the domestic among other forms of exploitation the difficulty of ascertaining the objective worth of womens work in this interpretation is further complicated by issues of status and class the middle class woman is more likely to mythologise her femininity to believe she chose it even to enjoy playing the role of domestic goddess her pleasure her freedom to choose becomes entangled with the actual work of house and children to the point where they become impossible even for her to separate it is this confusion that manifests itself in the politics of child benefit where what is perceived as problematic is not the benefit itself but its universality the welloff woman has no particular need of a state benefit but the money symbolises something in whose loss or concealment these same women have consented what it symbolises is recognition recognition of the difficulties and selfsacrifice of nurture but more importantly of a common enterprise of the fact that in children the personal once more finds an interface with the political middle class parenthood as it is lived may sometimes be narcissistic selfconfirming soaked through with the philosophy of consumer and personal choice but it is also the point at which the private goes out into the world once more at which the mother becomes visible and politically active again would the women who protest about losing child benefit agree to have their domestic work legitimised and waged one consequence at least might be the replacing of todays atomised femininity with a new era of female unity,2010-10,one difficulty applying concept justice equality womens life least woman live lie distinguishing inherently personal need accomplished politically one simone de beauvoir

so a call has gone out for grandparents around spain to down tools and go on strike because theyre sick to the back teeth of all that childcare babysitting to baby sitin spains grandparents to strike september will they heed it probably not grandparents see the children as their responsibility they care too much to put themselves first so they are taken for granted undervalued and unrecognised research our charity did a year ago estimated that the uks million grandparents are supporting families by providing childcare worth bn every year parents often see grandparents as the perfect childcare providers because they do it for love not money the children already know and trust them they will care for the children when they are ill and cover antisocial hours they will even have children for weeks at a time to get parents through the school holidays but it costs it costs grandparents money while the children are in their care bus fares lunches treats it costs them time grandparents may give up work or reduce their paid hours to care younger workingage grandparents tend to do the most most grandparents in this situation are women who have already had time out of paid work to raise a family they are less likely to have the national insurance contributions they need to get a full basic state pension so taking more time out of paid work to care for grandchildren could cost them in retirement but few think about that spains example where half of all grandparents look after their grandchildren every day one in eight for more than nine hours a day exposes the reliance of this society and its economy on a voluntary unpaid army of carers here grandparents provide the childcare that working parents cannot give and the state does not offer and as the article points out spains culture of long hours and lack of parttime jobs does much to encourage the situation the uk economy would grind to a halt if grandparents went on strike as they were being asked to do in spain one in three working mums rely on grandparents so that they can work also it is a concern that the cuts in public spending that we are facing will see a reduction in formal provision of both childcare and care services for older people grandparents will be expected to fill this caring gap for both their grandchildren and older relatives if we are going to rely on grandparents more we have to recognise the contribution they make seven out of grandparents agree they should be paid through tax credits or childcare vouchers but there is another hidden group who do the hardest job and who get the worst deal these are the familyandfriends carers in the uk most of them grandparents who are raising children who can no longer live with their parents this may be because of parental drug misuse abuse or neglect imprisonment domestic violence bereavement or a combination of factors it would cost the taxpayer bn each year in care costs alone if those children were in the care system if

two years ago my husband and i both worked fulltime as teachers in separate ofstedgraded outstanding comprehensive schools in middleclass neighbourhoods in suffolk i earned about per annum and my husband about we had a very comfortable life with our combined income of around in we decided to start a family we now have a twoyearold daughter and i am expecting our second child in january in order to look after our children i decided to forgo career progression and opt to work part time i now earn per annum to offset our income deficit my husband took a promotion to a new job in a much tougher school in a deprived part of a much bigger town he now works in a more stressful environment and works evenings and weekends regularly due to his increased responsibility and workload his income is now about and so he is a higherrate tax payer our combined income is now therefore about following yesterdays announcements we stand to lose per year in child benefit from this is on top of taking an initial combined pay cut in order for me to bring up our children parttime we have a large mortgage of around costing us per month for our modest end terrace house neither of us had grants at university and i still owe money on my student loans despite graduating in we pay for childcare while i am at work under this new proposed system of child benefit if i returned to work fulltime and earned the i did two years ago our childcare costs would obviously increase but i would still be better off than i am now my husband could go back to a less stressful teaching job earning what he did before and have more time to spend with his family we would earn a little under again and would keep our child benefit my question is how would this benefit our daughter and her unborn sibling we would be financially better off but would the children really benefit from having two fulltime working parents although neither of their parents would see them much except at weekends we would have extra per year we could put in a trust fund for them as well as our higher combined wages how can the government call this system child benefit at all we agree that people in our income bracket should be the first to lose child benefit payments if cuts are to be made but what we cannot understand is the system being introduced to judge who is deserving maybe we should get divorced as our parents possibly should have also done to have made sure we got student grants under the previous conservative government in the s the writer of this blog prefers to remain anonymous because of the personal

in the week that made in dagenham opens at the cinema celebrating those heroic women who walked out of the ford plant in to fight for equal pay how depressing to read that of british schools now offer cheerleading as a sport one march forward two twirling skips back the other day someone asked me on twitter are you a feminist of course i tweeted back five minutes later possibly overthinking a brief exchange of sentences with someone i will never meet i added but it depends what you mean by the word feminism has matured nicely to the stage where its definition is complex and flexible my first instinctive reply had taken the question to mean do you believe in equal pay equal rights and social freedom for all but in that is surely just another way of asking are you normal or a moron if my tweeter was inquiring whether i am an active campaigning feminist that would be no but i know where my heart lies when i hear those great old birds from dagenham reminiscing about their struggle and when i see teenage girls in boots and knickers waving pompoms and being told they are doing sport they arent doing sport they are waggling their arses near boys who are doing sport the boys are motivated to compete harder and triumph in the subliminal or not so subliminal hope that theyll get first pick of these little minxes on the sidelines even if you dont think its sexual and i do i think these girls might as well be bent over a rock waiting to be mounted by whichever caveman gets back first with a rabbit in his hand at best their job is to support the action rather than take part in it boring boring boring this is the week of the london ept poker festival in paddington i have been playing for years and only now are we starting to see more women at the tables trying to win tournaments rather than sitting on the rail looking pretty for their competing boyfriends ive been having the same tedious conversation for over a decade why cant women win at poker they can they just dont think its their place to try and just as that mindnumbing qampa starts to die down i open a newspaper to find that a whole new generation of young women is being trained in the watchingandwaving role rather than getting stuck in for gods sake girls think of dagenham put your trousers back on and try to score a goal it isnt just my inner feminist that balks at a supportive beautifying role for girls in their formative years it is also my inner geek i was your classic school nerd chubby blotchy badly dressed maladroit scared of alcohol and readier to die than dance i was quite bright but that doesnt get you invited to parties it gets you invited to speak at the debating society to an audience of none when i wasnt angrily reading david copperfield and thinking i can spell every word in this book so if you dont want to kiss me then you lose sucker i was browsing american teen fiction in the secret hope of learning how to be a cooler girl but all it ever made me think was at least we dont have cheerleaders in american teen fiction and presumably culture the gap between the cool pretty girls and the losers was infinitely more pronounced because the cheerleading squad was a formal division between them wrongly shaped american girls didnt just feel left out they were these days as you can probably tell i wear squareness as a badge of pride i present the absurdly difficult quiz programme only connect monday nights on bbc which some have been kind enough to call the geekiest show on television i am free to be proud of that now thats not just because im older and worry less nor because someone else does my makeup for me though thats a mercy its also because geekiness has become rather fashionable the information age gives kudos to anyone who understands or cares about technology social networking allows kids to type their hellos rather than mime them across the terrors of the dance floor the average teen film hero now has thick glasses striped clothes and a brain like a computer im not saying that kids who score lower on brainpower and higher on hotness should be denied their chance to shine theyll shine anyway dont worry about that there is barely a teenage girl alive who wouldnt swap a point iq for a size figure and perfect skin and those are the clever ones but the social gap between beautiful cool teenagers and shy clumsy latedeveloping ones which causes real misery for millions of young people was narrowing with the rise of geek chic the opportunity may finally be there for school sport utopia everyone kicking around in the mud having fun learning to compete hard yet be gracious in defeat with those who are always defeated having their other strengths respected so they dont feel like big fat failures or you know have cheerleading jam that teenage beauty contest right on to the actual curriculum forty years after the dagenham strikes four out of british schools are putting the hot girls in porny costumes and teaching them to shake their buns through life the chubby or selfconscious girls can only watch envy and remember that they dont look right meanwhile the boys play football and learn that competition is a male thing in another years perhaps these men can be paid more than women for the same jobs because they are literally more goaloriented well done everybody wwwvictoriacorencom,2010-10,week made dagenham open

across the world one in three women are subjected to domestic abuse in the course of their lives and one in five to rape or attempted rape according to the un rape is used as a weapon of war in many conflicts the horrific impact of which we have seen for years in places such as darfur and dr congo how do you begin to get governments across the world to begin to tackle this actionaid and other nongovernmental organisations thought last march that they had achieved one small step forward on that path the labour government finally appointed a minister for international violence against women glenys kinnock the idea was that she would be able to move this agenda on both domestically and internationally key tasks in kinnocks intray included getting gender issues out of the preserve of the department of international development dfid and into the ministry of defence mod and the foreign office fco too the logic was inescapable given that of victims of conflict are civilians in congo you are more at risk as a woman than as a soldier internationally there has been a real momentum driven in part by hillary clinton the un women agency has been set up under michelle bachelet the former chilean president but kinnock for all her immense experience and commitment had only just begun work before she left government since then the coalition government has been stalling promising to attend to the issue and finally today they announced that lynne featherstone will be their champion for the issue but this is not a ministerial post there will be no budget and no staff featherstone wont have the clout to really advocate on this issue where it needs to be pushed into the entire understanding and policy on security peacekeeping and conflict resolution the problem was that the government was in a dilemma embarrassingly all the ministerial teams of dfid mod and the fco are male there simply was no woman minister who could represent britain on this issue abroad and they wanted a woman given the importance of gender in development this is a problem which is likely to dog this government while of course men can and should speak up on gender issues it isnt always as credible or convincing to have male politicians talking about female empowerment andrew mitchell speaks up on womens issues such as maternal mortality but inevitably it is edged with a note of gallantry today is the international day for the elimination of violence against women but violence against women too often drops below the radar and becomes a private problem recognition and greater understanding of how it circumscribes womens lives all over the world is woefully needed millions of girls dont finish their education for fear of violence and rape on their journeys to and from school millions of women cant make their voices heard for fear of retribution violence against women impedes progress on the un millennium development goals our whole understanding of conflict and security is still dominated by narrow concepts of men fighting other men with pieces of technological weaponry one of the most urgent requirements is to embed into emergency planning womens needs for security in the aftermath of both haitis earthquake and the tsunami in asia there was an increase in rape if women are heard responses can be put in place in haiti women made their anxieties clear and groups of men set up patrols of the camps to improve security for women this is the kind of innovation which needs to be bedded into a wide range of security work and that requires shifting deeply

of course there are differences take a photo of women and men in any moment in time and apart from those matters related to reproductive physiology you will find average differences in say fondness for romance novels vampire movies power tools and fistfights when i was a student the differences of interest were in such skills as finger dexterity which explained why women were better at typing and cooking womens raging hormones which made them unfit for serious work or political office and fear of success which explained why there werent more women in the professions interest in finger dexterity vanished when men got their clumsy paws on keyboards and kitchen utensils and fear of success was trampled to death by the crush of women entering professional schools once discrimination became illegal there is a benefit to having written about sex differences your whole professional life you get perspective when i was growing up no american woman had ever been an astronaut a rabbi a general a supreme court justice or secretary of state women were barely blips on the radar in law medicine business bartending insurance police engineering and politics there were no womens wcs in the us senate men and women cheerfully claimed theyd never work for a woman boss or vote for a woman of course some things were better when i was young pms hadnt been invented there is also a disadvantage to having written about sex differences your whole professional life it makes you feel awfully old having to read over and over and over and over yet another incarnation of the view that men and womens brains differ in structure and function differences that explain why women are allegedly better at empathy and talking than men and men are better at maths and science you tip your hat to the current generation of scholars notably cordelia fine with delusions of gender and rebecca jordanyoung with brain storm the flaws in the science of sex differences and you are grateful that they have taken up the cudgel as you sigh here we go again to be sure the biomedical revolution has produced stunning brainimaging technologies revelations about the human genome and fascinating discoveries in behavioural genetics few psychological scientists are still fighting the natureornurture war i remember how angry feminist scholars were in the s with sociologist alice rossis biopsychosocial model of parenting we wanted the bio part out of there but that battle is over its nature and nurture few scientists or parents believe that any child can become anything with the right environment the childs own genetic predispositions have something to do with his or her personality and interests but if biology itself is not the enemy in the study of gender biological reductionism still is the latest version even has a name neurosexism the use of new technology or the language of neuroscience to support old prejudices and stereotypes ive been following the studies of sex differences in the brain for two decades now and have yet to be persuaded that they mean much because the investigators perpetuate the same errors first the very differences in behaviour they wish to explain are stereotypes women are more empathic than men and then any sex differences that turn up on a brain scan are invoked to explain them but empathy is not a fixed trait like eye colour it varies with the situation when social psychologists observe men and women in different situations where they are given the chance to behave empathically or not sex differences evaporate are women more empathic than men in their dealings with enemies or strangers dont count on it second even when investigators discover a small brain difference say that in some women both sides of the brain light up while they are doing a puzzle whereas in most mens only one side does they often ignore the fine print the more important finding that the sexes didnt differ in their actual test performance third brains are as idiosyncratic as fingerprints shaped and sculpted by their owners experiences over time yet most people want to hear that brain structure determines behaviour not that behaviour affects brain structure in terms of brain function the overlap between the sexes is greater than any average difference between them yet its the differences that get the attention publicity and funding here then is the irony in developed nations where women fight in battle and men change nappies the sexes are becoming more alike in their roles jobs motivations and values placed on work and family yet efforts to pinpoint some essential difference in the brain continue in the many countries in which women are completely ruled by men where even the attempt to attend school puts them in peril of their lives sex differences are at their greatest can brain scans explain the dazzling pace of progress in some nations and the brutal oppression of women in others worldwide the greatest predictor of womens advancement in science is the extent to which they have equal access to education and careers not which half of their brains lights up when they are doing a maths puzzle that is a finding that has not changed in my lifetime and i doubt that all the brainscan studies being done today will change it in the future the university of cambridge centre for gender studies in association with the guardian

forty years ago tomorrow the televised miss world beauty pageant was hit by tomatoes as well as smoke flour and stinkbombs millions of tv viewers watched the first headlinegrabbing act of the newly formed womens liberation movement wlm as they chanted were not beautiful were not ugly were angry born that summer the movement flourished for a decade and sparked hundreds of feminist groups all over the country in miss world was as much of an institution as the queens speech or armistice day on british tv but the protest at the royal albert hall in london marked the beginning of the end dropped by the bbc at the end of the decade it is now available only in the more obscure parts of the multichannel world although it thrives overseas it seems incredible that it was on tv says sue finch one of the protestors it really was a cattle market jane grant who had been at the first wlm conference at ruskin college in helped to organise the protest she fondly remembers the detailed planning and stresses that the focus was on the shows host bob hope a hollywood comedian with a reputation for reactionary and racist gags it wasnt about messing things up for the women in the competition or causing harm in any way sarah wilson a veteran of s revolutionary politics was chosen to start the protest when bob hope was going on and on with terrible grotesque stuff i got up and swung my football rattle it seemed ages before anybody responded people were lighting their cigarettes to ignite the smoke bombs but then i saw stuff beginning to cascade down from her position in the balcony jenny fortune saw the signal she had come with a busload of women from essex university we threw leaflets bags of flour and smoke bombs the albert hall was covered with smoke and leaflets it was pandemonium one woman who had been watching miss world on tv at home nearby actually raced out of her house and joined in fortune was among several women to be arrested finch who was nine months pregnant was seized by bouncers and literally bounced out grant was held in a room in the hall until about midnight four of the women decided to conduct their own defence including jenny fortune and jo robinson robinson was heavily pregnant and repeatedly used her right to ask for a loo break which eventually annoyed the magistrate when she threatened to relieve herself in the court a fracas ensued the women on trial were rearrested and spent the night in holloway prison and ended up being fined for various offences nevertheless fortune describes the experience as an epiphany it was the most fantastic feeling facing your fears and my fears were my familys fears if i stopped being a nice middleclass girl id get into bad trouble some of the women continued campaigning fortune became active in the claimants union and in housing politics in east london campaigning for womens right to housing in their own names sue finch became a peace campaigner and earlier this year was among demonstrators who closed down the aldermaston weapons base the movement is part of the current feminist renaissance some of the miss world veterans will be joining a reclaim the night march started in the s revived in the s against violence and sexism in the streets not everything has marched on however this week saw another anniversary years ago the sun launched its page parade of naked women yesterday in that paper feminist germaine greer wrote in support of the feature the womens liberation movement changed a bit of the world on november they didnt change everything this article was

type men and hardwired into google and you tap into a wonderfully absurd catalogue of assertions about male behaviour men are hardwired to cheat ignore their wives suspect infidelity overspend fail love money pursue women and achieve supremacy in the workplace meanwhile women are hardwired to worry about their weight and dump cheaters all include the magic phrase scientific studies show its a snapshot of how science is being used and abused to legitimise gender stereotypes it would be laughable if it didnt signify how a form of biological determinism the claim that differences between men and women have a basis in innate biological characteristics has reemerged and acquired an astonishing popular currency this fascination in differences between the sexes is a staple of the selfhelp industry john grays thesis about planetary confusion men are from mars and women are from venus has spawned nearly two decades of publishing with guides on everything from communication to food and all still enjoy warm amazon reviews and healthy sales whats changed in recent years is that the idea of innate biological differences for instance in cognitive abilities or communication skills has gained academic credibility and powerful champions in widely admired researchers such as simon baron cohen author of the essential difference and steven pinker in their wake has followed this boom in scientific studies claiming to find hardwiring for sex differences and every time they do so they are guaranteed to accumulate column inches of free publicity the argument is that breakthroughs in neuroscience genetics and evolutionary psychology are proving false the feminist consensus of the last odd years that gender is entirely a social construct the claim is that there are innate differences and they go part of the way in explaining why men and women have such different lives nonsense retort a number of prominent women academics who have been trying to fight back in the us and the uk a new book brainstorm by rebecca jordanyoung exhaustively analyses every relevant study on hormonal sex differentiation of the human brain and argues that they are riddled with weaknesses inconsistencies and ambiguity its a clarion call for better science on the subject jordanyoungs call is echoed in the uk by deborah cameron an oxford professor of language and communication she takes issue with one of the central claims that women have superior verbal abilities some speculate that this is linked to brain structure others that it has an evolutionary explanation cameron sees both as purely speculative and insists that explanations of difference must take account of three much more prosaic factors first that verbal behaviour is linked to activity type what someone usually spends much of their time doing if that activity type is looking after small children or repairing drains it will affect how they use language second verbal differences reflect differences in power and status contrary to the commonplace assumption that women speak more there is now mountains of evidence claims cameron that where status is not a factor there is no difference between men and women where status does matter such as office meetings men talk much more than women finally cameron argues that we use language to project our identity much like our choice of clothing to distinguish our sense of who we are in terms of class life role as well as gender and all of these identities are socially constructed factor out these variables and youre left with no clearcut differences in how men and women use language or take another central pillar of the new biological determinism which asserts that men and women have different cognitive capabilities professor elizabeth spelke has spent her academic career looking at cognitive development in infants and concludes all this research supports the startlingly boring conclusion that there are no significant differences between men and womens cognitive abilities a tiny number of tests show sex differences one of these famously used to argue that men are better at engineering and other sciences is a test comparing two shapes men are slightly more likely to use a method known as mental rotation despite it being rather less efficient overall in items in the test only three show sex difference two of them favour girls and only this aspect of mental rotation favours boys spelke is astonished as to why this slight difference favouring boys has attracted such disproportionate attention but if the evidence for biologically innate differences is so flimsy and full of conjecture why does it continue to have such a hold on the imagination in bestselling selfhelp books and among brilliant respected scientists cameron suggests that this grasping after certainty about gender roles is a response to anxiety there has been and still is rapid social change around the roles and opportunities of men and women cameron adds that a lot of the debate around differing communication skills seems rooted in a rise in conflict between the sexes my parents never had an argument about whose career came first or who should do the washing up but now everything is up for grabs without clearly differentiated roles men and women are competing over the same things job status time with the children whos going to do the housework which makes harmonious communication difficult so people look around for explanations spelke adds another intriguing dimension to the sustained popularity of forms of biological determinism her most recent research devised tests which showed that children as young as three begin to categorise the world by gender work she is doing indicates this could begin to develop even earlier at months interestingly the same process of categorisation in infants is not evident when it comes to race we are predisposed to see the social landscape in terms of gender says spelke she thinks its possible that it served some adaptive purpose in our evolution but that actually gender is a very bad indicator of behaviour because there is so much variability within each sex for instance if one man likes bananas that is no reason to assume another does to spelke this predisposition means the debate about the differences between men and women will never reach a settled conclusion we keep on looking for differences because that is one of the basic ways we order our experience of the world that doesnt mean change isnt possible just that the argument will carry on getting sidetracked to focus on tiny differences rather than the much greater similarities good science will challenge the tendency to stereotype the danger though is what cameron refers to as stereotype threat if you tell women that women do less well in a maths test they will do less well confirming the claim dont tell them and they do better stereotypes are dangerous they become selffulfilling and can generate discrimination cameron points to interviews with callcentre managers who were discriminating against hiring men on their assumption that women were better at empathising so beware a popular mythology of hardwiring that can result in some very concrete and pernicious outcomes the university of cambridge centre for gender studies in association with the guardian and supported by cambridge university press is organising a series

the coalitions poverty adviser frank field will call for all children to be given parenting classes at school when he presents a governmentcommissioned review into poverty to the prime minister later this year the theme of fields review is how to prevent poor children becoming poor adults he recommends a move away from a mainly financial approach to tackling child poverty favoured by the last government to a strategy that focuses on parenting and on the early childhood years up to the age of five being a parent apart from running the army in afghanistan is the most important thing we will ask anyone to do and we assume people get the knowledge by osmosis and they dont the former labour minister said he said he was disturbed by research showing how accurate a prediction can be made as to where a child will be in their s by looking at their ability at months and just before five years narrowing divisions in childrens readiness for school at five was central to tackling divisions in later life he said a report by the sutton trust charity published last week showed that poorer children are twice as likely to start school with behavioural problems and warned that the gap had widened over the past years field interprets those findings as evidence that although the labour government was successful in reducing the overall number of children living in poverty parallel work needs to be done on reducing nonfinancial inequalities he argued that with generous investment the foundation years the first five years of a childs life could become more powerful than class in determining where children will be at five and where they will be at part of the problem was a decline in peoples understanding of good parenting he said there has been a rupturing of the level of parenting skills in my lifetime there was a collective wisdom about the beneficial effects of tough love you set boundaries for your children but you loved them within those boundaries during his research for the review he met numerous teachers who said those boundaries were no longer being set i think it is more difficult to parent now than it was the pressures on you are greater it is expected that people mothers should work and rather quickly after birth even if they are on their own postwar housing developments have split up communities you are bombarded with demands from television about the things that children should have it puts a much greater pressure on parents to add to that you may not have had a good role model yourself he said ive met lots of heads who say children are worse prepared for school now than they were years ago children should be able to sit still they should know their own name they should be able to take their coat off they should understand the word stop they have to be able to hold a crayon teachers had told him they were increasingly obliged to teach children these skills he said in recommendations that he will present to the education secretary michael gove this week field will suggest that parenting should be taught as a theme within other subjects not as a separate ghetto subject so students would look for example at the development of a childs brain within their science gcses the teaching would help children understand what would equip them to be a fivestar parent while money is important he said i will be arguing in the report that there are other circumstances which the research shows are as important as money in determining outcomes the interest you take in your children how you bond with them whether you read to them the interest you show in what they are doing at school the government is committed to the same goal of eradicating child poverty in the uk by as set out by labour and has increased child tax credits paid to families falling below the poverty line field who was a director of the child poverty action group charity before he went into politics said he thought the extra money should have been spent on sure start projects aimed at helping children in their early life i would have argued though i wasnt in the game to argue a different split of that money between tax credits and the foundation years because if we are serious about transforming the lives of poorer children it wont simply come by increasing tax credits however generous they are,2010-11,coalition

as the changed landscape of capitol hill emerges there are new features silhouetted against the horizon they have shapely figures sharp suits and big wallets and hair blowdried to within an inch of its life they are sarah palins women the mama grizzlies age experience and crucially motherhood count although not as many won on tuesday as she would have liked they are a fascinating new political breed for us to contemplate not least in relation to our own female mps who find motherhood a tough struggle in the political sphere rather than a useful and overt votecatcher with the exception of christine odonnell who failed in delaware many of the grizzlies have broods some substantial like their heroine michele bachmann who was reelected to her third term in congress for minneapolis has five kids and she and her husband have fostered more in oklahoma mary fallin a mother of six including four stepchildren was voted in as governor and was accused of playing the mommy card against her childless rival palins women have turned their own fertility along with the makeup and the backcombing aimed to entice the men as well as impress the women into a political weapon whatever you do dont mess with these mothers mom knows best the only close comparison here in the uk is the mumsnetters courted so assiduously by all the male party leaders who have to bend their knee to the women you mess with at your peril but as yet none of these women has made the final step into running for political office for any party and those few women who do push through to the upper reaches of westminster often feel they cannot stay the course ruth kelly a former minister for women being one of the most obvious examples her politics aside many women expressed concern over how difficult it must be looking after four young children rather than noting how brilliantly equipped she was for high political office much fuss was made of the fact that she refused to take home a red box at night while responsible for the treasury brief yvette cooper also made it clear she would put her kids before political ambition citing her three young children as a reason not to run as labour leader rather than an ideal qualification for the job caroline spelman who sits on the tory frontbench holds it together with three kids on board but came a political cropper trying to pay for her nanny diane abbott perhaps came the closest to the status of grizzly running for the labour leadership and proclaiming west indian mums would go to the wall for their kids which then got her into trouble and the one mother who made it to the top margaret thatcher scarcely alluded to her children although the mummy returns came in handy later for headline writers its not an entirely new phenomenon in us politics and hillary clinton and michelle obama have had to play the game too but palin and her mamas have taken the maternal to dizzying new heights rather than hide the kids or try to cope with them away from the limelight they put them up front and sell themselves as wise mothers of course it costs money and not a small measure of ruthlessness it would also take radical change at westminster in terms of attitudes towards women and readiness to make a political life compatible with family life before many might contemplate it but in terms of political potency whatever you think

when word got out that stephen fry the tweedy cuddly face of acceptable bourgeois homosexuality had said something rather offensive about women a collective gasp rang out across the nation he couldnt have surely not lovely stephen fry for whom even the most homophobic grandmother reserves a soft spot not stephen fry the only man whom both the drugsandbuggery counterculture and the brandyandbigotry establishment recognise as one of their own unfortunately everyones favourite gay uncle really has proposed that women only ever have sex for money or to manipulate a man into a relationship despite claiming to have been misquoted by attitude magazine fry is on record in several other interviews opining that women dont really like sex for if they did they would go to hampstead heath and meet strangers to shag behind a bush frys words have upset many of his fans and for good reason the writer and broadcaster has a special genius as a chronicler of adolescence of the indignities of lust and romantic adventure for many of his followers this wry empathy with an almost universal human imbecility in the face of groinal temptation is what draws us to his work reading stephen frys books was a huge comfort in my lonely horny teenage years as such it is doubly hurtful that fry now informs me that as a woman i lack the necessary equipment to understand sexual desire as he elucidated in another interview you dont get what its like to have one of these in your bloody trousers many have queried whether fry a man with limited experience of a ladys intimate regions has the right to pronounce on female erotic preference feminists across the internet have defended themselves against the wearisome patriarchal charge of frigidity the more profound question however is why fry feels that females inhabit a world so alien to his own there are after all significant points of similarity between the erotic experiences of gay men and straight women not all of them anatomical both men and women who grow up desiring men understand what its like to have ones desires frowned upon both men and women who grow up desiring men know what its like to fear violence if we express our sexuality especially if were brazen enough to walk alone on the streets at night in this context frys spectacular ability to entirely dismiss the culture of shame sexual threat and social stigma associated with female sexuality seems offensively myopic the national treasures utter indifference to female experience is particularly chilling because he embodies a certain strand of cosy unthreatening uppermiddleclass homosexuality within whose ranks misogyny routinely goes unchallenged instead of solidarity in the face of a heteronormative patriarchy that oppresses all of us there remains a chasm of suspicion and misunderstanding that obstructs genuine solidarity between women and gay men frys words are a perfect expression of that process of mutual incomprehension a process whereby our culture has become so alienated from its own sexuality that erotic impulses can never be a point of community only of difference for example despite the bland saturation of our aesthetic environment with images of sexy ladies female sexuality is still a mystery to many men gay and straight a lot of men find it hard to grasp the many social reasons for female sexual reticence and harder still to imagine that a womans desires could have any similarity to their own frys belief in the rigidity of sexual difference overlooks centuries of sexist and homophobic oppression there are many reasons why women dont tend to go looking for a bonk in a park not only because a culture of shame and violence prevents many of us from seeking sexual enjoyment but because cottaging and

this year has seen a positive start to my review tackling the issue of why british companies have so few women appointed to the company board when i was first tasked by the government to take on this role i was inundated with offers of support from businesses and individuals looking to take part and help me with this work this support has been very welcome and has been reflected more widely by the momentum that this topic has built following the launch businesses media the department for business the government equalities office and the prime minister have really got behind the issue this impetus must not be allowed to wither as we move into we need more than just words of support from executives and real progress to be seen when cranfield university publish their female ftse over the coming years i am pleased to see that the debate has caught peoples imagination while much of the media focus has been on the dilemma of whether quotas would help or hinder womens progress this issue is a lot wider than this one question over the past few months i have met with many executives and interest groups and i have had evidence from more than businesses and individuals many of which included some excellent suggestions the question of quotas is one that i will be considering carefully before making my recommendations this february quotas have proved successful in some countries but many of the women i have spoken with are against these i have not ruled them out as a recommendation but at the moment i am not convinced that they are the right method to encourage progress female executives need to be recognised for the talent and skills that they possess i know there is a multitude of women ready for board appointments but from the conversations i have had it seems the root of the problem may be accessing this pool of talent there is no hard evidence of a lack of female talent although i have heard some oldfashioned chairmen suggest this one of the things that i have focused my meetings on over the past few months has been how to bring more women into the recruitment process and broaden the selection process many ideas have been discussed on how best to facilitate this one possibility is to create a best practice code for headhunters tasked with board level and other senior appointments they also debated how to increase the transparency of board appointments made via a nomination committee the steering group for my review has also talked about how to generate a greater supply of women to take part in the board recruitment process we have recently discussed establishing a group of about board executives to play a counselling role for new and potential female board appointees and i have also thought about the merits of setting up an academy for female executives tasked with identifying successful business women the academy would train potential female candidates and match them with a current company chair to mentor them as i said the problem of increasing the role of women in the corporate world is greater than just the issue of quotas and another area that needs far more debate is the supply versus demand argument there needs to be more pressure on companies to open up their recruitment process and to bring women up the ranks from within the business companies could be required to provide board internships to give senior staff the experience of what it means to be on a board many excellent ideas have come out of my meetings but this year we have also seen business groups take the initiative the club which was launched in november is a group of ukbased chairmen pledging to an aspiration of achieving a board with women making up at least by the cbi has also publicised a number of ideas including the requirement for all listed uk companies to report on their progress in improving diversity to encourage an increase in the number of women on boards it is admirable that so many companies have rallied behind this cause and i am pleased to be ending this year on a high note with so much discussion and debate being driven not only by my review but by businesses themselves however it would be a shame for so much talk not to lead to positive action as we move into the new year i hope that we will see such action being led by the corporate industry and that the results of my review will not be the end of this debate but only the beginning,2010-12,year ha seen positive start review tackling issue british company woman appointed company board wa first tasked government take role wa inundated offer support

this time months ago we promised it was going to be the biggest year in feminism ever so was it er sort of we werent wrong about it being a celebratory year but our predictions of the feminist events to watch in were a bit hit and miss where did we strike gold the significance of the movie precious the story of an overweight illiterate teenager in s harlem pregnant by her abusive father primarily female cast a mustsee we said come the oscars the film won six nominations and two awards what did we overestimate the impact of drew barrymores directorial debut whip it a great film that turned out to be a bit of a howler the film went right under the radar mores the pity so what else did we get right well it was always going to be a bumper year and maybe we could have even got a bit more excited about it marked the th anniversary both of the publication of germaine greers still controversial the female eunuch and of kate milletts landmark sexual politics it was also four decades since the agendachanging first ever national womens liberation conference this killer combination of events galvanised campaigning groups everywhere and if anything our predictions of a feminist bonanza in underestimated the resurgence of grassroots activism the first ever feminism summer school hosted by uk feminista in july was a major success picking up international coverage and the reclaim the night movement was invigorated in force with more than women attending candlelit vigils in central london in november where djs kept the crowds going until am meanwhile more than people attended london feminism networks october conference student activism came into its own even before the recent protests with leeds university unleashing a feminist flash mob during freshers week complete with a giant papier mache vagina dancing to lady gagas bad romance last month women against the cuts joined in with demonstrations at the treasury our film predictions were admittedly a bit lousy with the nobrainer exception of precious the animated antidisney film ponyo about a fishgirl who swims away from her fathers underwater castle whats not to love you go girl pretty much tanked tina feys screwball comedy date night turned out to be more about her tummy control corset than about female liberation and angelina jolies potentially inspiring tom cruise replacement role as a cia agent in salt was eclipsed by her burgeoning status as earth mother extraordinaire we did tell you to look out for mad men series three the best show on tv when it comes to exploring gender relations but even we couldnt have predicted the rise of the cult of joan or that the washington post would crown mad men the most feminist tv show in history simply for demonstrating the consequences of a world where sexism goes unchallenged mad mens writers arent sexist the time period was our book predictions were spot on just about we said andrea levys the long song would win the booker it made the shortlist and won the orange prize we failed to spot emma donoghue though whose bleak but highly acclaimed kidnap novel room was the booker favourite until howard jacobson pipped her at the post natasha walters living dolls the return of sexism virago was indeed the hugely controversial event we predicted it was praised by some an important book said sarah vine in the times kicks nuts magazine right in the nuts said bidisha in the new statesman but awarded the meh badge by others joan smith still the same old inoffensive feminist at heart kat banyards the equality illusion faber which months before its release we credited with exposing some uncomfortable facts also made a splash a terrific read said louise doughty give it to david cameron and the chairman of marks amp spencer said anthea mcteirnan in the irish times we perhaps gave a little too much prominence to martin amiss the pregnant widow jonathan cape brace yourself for a furore as amis takes on sexual politics bracing was not necessary the great ones latest novel largely failed to reignite the gender debate despite being described as strange and sparkling by the new york review of books there were two gigantic omissions in our books category however which i am still personally kicking myself about two books came out this year which in the longterm could change how we view gender for ever we didnt list them in our events of the year mea culpa cordelia fines delusions of gender the real science behind sex differences icon books finally debunked the myth that men and womens minds are significantly different and in pink brain blue brain oneworld lise eliot argued that we create gender stereotypes in our children by unwittingly reinforcing barely perceptible differences in female and male brains from birth both books were favourably reviewed and hotly discussed over time their conclusions could have farreaching consequences as significant as the female eunuch where else did we misfire bbc threes lip service a sexy funny and irreverent drama that could prove to be even more daring than cult us series the l word no it was something of a damp squib we would have been better focusing our attentions on itvs downton abbey a surprise feminism lite ratings winner with superb roles for the oftneglected older woman and even a suffragette storyline ok so the votes for women theme was a bit weak but we appreciated the nod nonetheless and especially the scene where the politically aware lady sybil shocked everyone by wearing gasp a pair of trousers and a sequinned headband not the sort of stuff you usually get on itv on a sunday night at least we bigged up ellescentrepompidou one of the biggest exhibitions of womens art in the world this year as well as the whitney biennial in new york an unprecedented of the artists featured are women but we couldnt possibly have foreseen the exciting news that sound artist susan philipsz would win this years turner prize although its painful to note that shes only the fourth woman to win the award in its year history roll on more accolades like this in,2010-12,time month ago promised wa going biggest year feminism ever wa er sort werent wrong celebratory year

any woman whos ever had to endure boorish sexist abuse when going about their daily life and id estimate conservatively thats most of us probably remembers asking herself at some point why the hell should i have to put up with this i imagine thats exactly what lisa robinson was wondering when she found herself being subjected to obscene insults and taunts from cardiff city fans while on a train journey home back in september however unlike a lot of us and even im guilty of this sometimes robinson didnt just chunter to herself about it and neither did she wait until she was safely ensconced in her own front room before she decided to let off steam about the sexual harassment shed been subjected to no when lisa robinson found herself on the receiving end of a load of sexist old shite she decided to do something about it she decided to stop the train first robinson pulled the emergency handle but when the driver chose to ignore her complaint and continued the journey without so much as a word to her perpetrators about their neanderthal behaviour robinson decided shed finally had enough and so she waited until the train pulled into her station then she got down onto the railway tracks and she refused to budge from in front of that train until the police were eventually called theres only one way to describe a woman whos prepared to take on not just a carriage full of misogynists but a tonne train as well and thats as a bloody hero and lisa robinson isnt the only woman whos heroically fought back against sexism this year dawn foster is another one this time cataloguing the abuse shes been suffering as a female cyclist in london on her inspirational wankers site in fact has been an epic year for women who have had enough and arent prepared to put up with it any more theres been the publication of holly kearls stop street harassment book on how to make public spaces safe and welcoming for women there have been some fantastic feminist friday actions from object activists and there have been reclaim the night marches not just in london but in manchester glasgow oxford cambridge portsmouth and other towns as well all of the women who have taken part in these events are my heroes as is any woman whos prepared to take a stand against the endless sexism that blights our public space sisters i salute you all,2010-12,woman ever endure boorish

demands after the wedding a certain level of offence has been acquired since then the merriam webster dictionary defines the word as a disparaging term for a woman and in andrea dworkin agreed saying the word reduces women to the one essential cunt our essence our offence naturally there have been attempts to reclaim it notably by eve ensler and angela carter but even germaine greer author of an article titled lady love your cunt concedes that it is one of the few remaining words in the english language with a genuine power to shock for the shock and amusement then mr naughtie we thank you malaysia has introduced a fleet of womenonly buses the rapid lady bus service they are predictably painted pink to avoid the sexual harassment that occurs on mixed services while we applaud the authorities for recognising the problem wouldnt it be preferable to introduce a menonly bus service to make perpetrators aware that such behaviour is unacceptable thousands of women and children will spend christmas in a refuge having fled an abusive home and this year refuge the domestic violence charity is running an appeal for toys so that mothers in refuges often on low incomes can still give

last weeks release of the poverty review by labour mp frank field gave all at parenting uk hope that the debate around the importance of good parenting and its role in improving child outcomes would be reinvigorated and taken up by the new government and the public alike fields recommendation that parenting classes should be readily available to all parents has been met with cries of nanny state but isnt it time we ditched the stigma and accepted that we can all be better parents parenting classes do not brand us as bad parents rather as good parents after all what is wrong with a bit of advice those working with families are well aware of the difference good parenting can make in changing life chances making children more confident and secure giving them resilience to life events and helping them to make friends and do well academically you only need to look at the wealth of research available to see that parents influence on their children is paramount and nowhere more so than in the first few years of life fields review is not as polly toynbee worries it might be an excuse for the government to abandon its commitment to reduce child poverty but an opportunity to view with a wider lens the reasons why children live in poverty not just financial but emotional social and educational poverty our narrow interpretation of the word poverty to mean purely lack of money is part of the policy problem and a barrier to the solution if the government really mean what they say about improving social mobility and according to nick cleggs recent hugo young lecture they do they should seriously consider fields recommendations it was probably no coincidence that unicefs report on child inequality which ranks the uk among the worst offenders was released on the same day as the poverty review nor is it a coincidence that the unicef report recognises that inequality is based not just on household income rather it states that child poverty is about more than poverty of income it is also about poverty of opportunity and expectation of cultural and educational resources of housing and neighbourhoods of parental care and time of local services and community resources field could not have put it better himself while unicef summarises that of the available measures the most important single guide to and predictor of a familys socioeconomic status remains its level of household income is also advises that policies to prevent children from falling behind must therefore address the different dimensions of disadvantage individually as well as collectively unicef and field agree on one thing as unicef reports the central practical message for efforts to reduce bottomend inequality in child wellbeing could therefore not be clearer the earlier the intervention the

so frank field is recommending more early years education as a solution to child poverty report december rather than improving the material circumstances of the poor the focus yet again is to be on social mobility and improving life chances without any recognition that in a stagnant economy few opportunities for advancement exist the problem is not seen to be poverty but poor parents who are perceived to be responsible for their own poverty and that of their children at the beginning of the st century we seem to have moved back to the thcentury view that both educational failure and poverty are caused by individual failings rather than material factors yet charles booth found in the s in his survey of every household in london that of poverty was due to material factors and only to bad habits and human failings i would argue that a similar balance operates in relation to contemporary society we need to stop blaming those in circumstances the vast majority of the rest of us would also find totally debilitating depressing and demotivating professor diane reay university of cambridge frank field puts parenting as the key determinant in improving a childs life chances and he is right that income and schooling are second to this the early intervention initiatives highlighted in the report such as parenting classes sure start and improving the role of health visitors for parents are vital to ensure that parents are emotionally and practically equipped to deal with their own childrens needs doing this will create mentally healthy resilient and emotionally literate young people and adults who then form families that contribute constructively to society thus breaking the cycle of intergenerational disadvantage currently the government is spending money on mopping up the consequences of not providing this early support at the cost of millions to the nhs social services and the criminal justice system cameron and cleggs praise for the report must now be turned into a government action plan sarah brennan chair children and young peoples mental health coalition my wife was the researcher who interviewed parents for harriet wilsons study parents and children in the innercity however it did not attribute poor parenting to ignorance or values but the lack of resources associated with poverty restricting the way they wanted to raise their families the

the cost of childcare varies enormously compared to type hours and the area in which you live and theres a reason why very few people have a nanny they are phenomenally expensive expect to pay her a

insurance at after the initial of gross salary meaning a london employer would have to pay an additional sick pay at a week and maternity pay at of her salary for six weeks followed by statutory maternity pay at for a further weeks though as a small employer you can usually reclaim most of the smp costs you will also be expected to provide your nanny with food typically breakfast lunch drinks and snacks to equip her with a mobile phone and if its necessary for her to drive a car if she uses her own car youll have to pay her insurance petrol and general wear and tear outside london the cost is significantly cheaper according to nannytax the payroll service used by parents and nannies their latest figures for show the average daily nanny costs in outer london in other towns and if based in the countryside sharing a nanny with another family cuts the cost in half but is still expensive the next most expensive option tends to be a nursery costs vary according to region and to the age of the child with children under two being significantly more expensive the daycare trusts annual survey of childcare costs for puts a fulltime hour place for a child aged under two in london at a week in the southeast this costs and throughout england the figure is childminders who provide care in their homes are cheaper and tend not to make a distinction between ages the london rate is for a

parent is at home minimum pay is a week plus board and lodging they can only work for hours a week plus two evenings babysitting maximum tax credits can be used for childminders and nurseries since

support is about to shrink under the coalitions spending cuts from april she will lose a year in tax credits making the english graduates financial situation even more difficult having my tax credits reduced will make a sizeable difference she says at the moment i can pay my bills but that doesnt mean theres any money left over the question of whether it pays for a mother to work is already a conundrum for many women particularly those in london or the southeast where childcare costs are highest or those who are paying for more than one youngster in childcare while childcare should be seen as the responsibility of both parents in a doubleincome household in reality the mothers wage is often weighed against the costs and you only have to glance at social networking site mumsnet to see that particularly for twoparent families that can survive on one salary spending all of a second one on childcare and commuting doesnt financially appear to make much sense of course there are longterm career monetary and psychological benefits these include payments into pension plans the security of a job that will be worth more once the preschool stage is over and which can hopefully be retained in a recession and a sense of identity beyond motherhood the importance of which should not be overlooked of mothers go back to work according to the latest figures from the office for national statistics but when totting up childcare costs that average a week for a fulltime nursery place for a child under two in london and for the rest of england these may not come into play as one female academic who describes herself as at the top of the pay scale commented on mumsnet after forking out a month for childcare and for petrol and her car loan it costs me a month to go to work another mother adds having just had a second child it seems pointless to go back to work around of my earnings will go on childcare and my childminder is slightly less expensive than others a mother placing two young children fulltime in a london nursery who is not eligible for tax credits or help from her employer will have to earn gross just to pay for it and that doesnt include the cost of travel lunch or buying work clothes a parent requiring the same childcare outside london would need a salary of going up to if that person spends a day on travel costs and food a parent working parttime and putting one child aged under two in a london nursery would need to earn to cover the fees the changes to the tax credits system announced in octobers comprehensive spending review suggest that the question of whether it makes financial sense for a lone parent or both parents to work is going to be felt most acutely lower down the income scale an analysis by independent research organisation the resolution foundation suggests that from when the cuts kick in families on more modest household incomes of to particularly those who rely on childcare to allow both parents to work or lone parents in this income bracket are going to be hit hardest by these changes taking inflation into account the organisation calculates that parents who receive the full support for childcare especially working mothers living in the southeast who face the highest childcare costs could lose as much as a year or far more if they have two young children creating a major disincentive to go out to work what were talking about is a group whose incomes are too high to rely on state support but too low to avoid a real daytoday struggle says resolution policy analyst james plunkett research conducted by the tuc for the guardian shows that it is these lowtomiddle income families with median household earnings of and median income including benefits of who will be disproportionately penalised a lone parent of two children working full time in london on just over the minimum wage of will lose of her tax credit entitlement compared to the amount she receives at present if both children are in fulltime care if she earns the cut will be and if she earns for twoparent families with one working full time at incurring no childcare costs the loss will be but if the same family sees their household income rise to with a second parent working parttime and so using childcare their entitlement will be reduced by in london or across england if that income rises to they will receive less than at present in london across england our analysis shows that even families living off the minimum wage will be hit by the governments austerity package says brendan barber tuc general secretary the changes will leave millions of working families on modest incomes significantly worse off the cuts which will affect million families and save bn a year by the end of the parliament have been brought about by freezing slashing and reducing different elements of the hugely complicated child tax credit and working tax credit system a lower measure of inflation the consumer price index rather than the retail price index has been applied to certain elements the entire award will be tapered more quickly and the family element of the child tax credit worth will be tapered more quickly and at far lower incomes crucially there will be a reduction in the amount of eligible childcare costs that can be claimed through working tax credit wtc from to the poorest families receiving wtc can claim as much as a week for two children in childcare or for one child but this will fall to a week for two children or for one child from april a total of families receive wtc support for childcare costs with of these being lone parents and for those receiving the full award finding an additional or a week may well be a step too far in some cases as the costs of childcare rise it could no longer be financially feasible for both parents to work says barber kate groucutt policy director of the daycare trust adds were concerned that its going to be harder for lower and middleincome families particularly with cuts to the amount of childcare costs that can be claimed under wtc were concerned women will no longer be able to go to work and that for lone parents who make up the majority of claimants its going to be difficult to balance the family budget the trust is also perturbed that wraparound before and afterschool care already sketchily implemented will become less available since local authorities will be under no obligation to provide it making it harder for mothers to work outside school hours and it believes there should be greater financial support for working parents who already pay significantly more for their childcare than in any other developed country with a recent oecd study suggesting of the average net income in the uk goes on this compared to in france in germany and in belgium this is because childcare is far more heavily subsidised in these places many women do want to work and have goodquality childcare they can trust and afford and this country does lag behind many others in that respect the last thing we want to do is take a step backwards groucutt says with little information about how childcare will be paid for under the universal credit system to be introduced from there are concerns that this regressive step will be the case while david cameron may be determined that work should pay many working mothers using childcare may be questioning whether it does in reality certainly for rebecca the reduction in support would have meant her fulltime nursery fees would have felt insurmountable had these changes come in when my daughter was at nursery fulltime the childcare costs would have been so unmanageable i would have questioned the benefits of working she says i am fortunate that my daughter is now at primary school

when we saw a commitment to shared parenting in the coalition agreement we thought it would be a good idea to find out how well the uk is doing so we are publishing today the fairness in families index fifi which pulls together a set of indicators across rich countries the index measures how much childcare and housework is being done by men and women as well as other indicators including equality in the workplace and the systems for parental leave in each country its a broad comprehensive and powerful analysis of gender equality in high income economies and we are right down there at the bottom end in th place the way we deal with families and work in the uk is highly gendered and basically unfair this is both good and bad news for the government the good news is that the coalition can make use of this starting point to explain their commitment to shared parenting and make the case for change they can reasonably argue that its not their fault that we are starting from a low base the bad news is that there is nothing in the governments plan of action to date which will make a significant difference to our rankings on the fifi table the big policy clue in the index is that without legislating for significant periods of reserved leave for fathers new parents will struggle to negotiate the gender traps which push men into breadwinning and capture women in the home the other piece of bad news is that the research on relationships shows that a highly divided arrangement where one person earns the money and the other stays at home is most likely to lead to unhappiness between the partners and eventual separation doing nothing to address our th place will undermine the thinking going on in government about how to support couple relationships families are under pressure from a system that provides little real choice as to how they should share their responsibilities sweden top of the table had a system of transferrable parental leave for years without seeing a real increase in the numbers of fathers taking career breaks for childcare or mothers sharing in the breadwinning it wasnt until they introduced the daddy month on a use it or lose it basis that their progress to a remarkable state of relative equality gathered pace the daddy month was reserved for fathers and it provided a significant amount of salary replacement the money is important even more so in a country like the uk where the gender pay gap is so large that families where the father takes time out from work face increased financial problems in straitened times the government will struggle to find the cash to invest in paternity leave but it could make a start by at least changing the shape of our leave system and providing more reserved leave for fathers companies who want to keep good employees will then have a choice as to how much they want to invest in salary replacement at least then the door will be open for families to have a choice and the gender pressure
